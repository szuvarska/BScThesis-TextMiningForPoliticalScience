The delegation from the Arab League, after wrapping up a visit to Northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, said that allegations of "ethnic genocide" and "religious persecution" are completely false, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson stated on Monday.
Arab countries appreciate China's efforts in caring for minority groups, including Muslims in Xinjiang, and they will continue to support China's endeavors in maintaining the development and stability of Xinjiang.After attending the 18th senior diplomats and officials' meeting and the 7th senior official-level strategic political dialogue of the China-Arab States Cooperation Forum, the 34-member group from 16 Arab countries, including Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Algeria visited Xinjiang between May 30 to June 2.The group visited a number of locations in Xinjiang and said that the reality on the ground does not match what is portrayed by Western media.
The region boasts harmony and stability, a rapidly growing economy and a colorful and prosperous culture, with residents living and working in peace and contentment.Mohammed Haj Ibrahim, director-general of the Department of Asian and African Affairs under the Syrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said that China has made constructive contributions to the fight against terrorism and extremism.
International cooperation on counter-terrorism should be strengthened, including the exchange of information and experience.The delegation visited the Id Kah Mosque and the old town of Kashgar, some 1,500 kilometers southwest of Urumqi.
Mohamed Moustafa Kamal Mohamed, permanent representative of Egypt to the Arab League, said he was very glad to see that the historic mosques in Kashgar are well preserved and equipped with modern facilities.The group praised China's 7-billion-yuan ($987 million) renovation of the old town of Kashgar, an ancient Silk Road city with a history stretching back more than 2,000 years.Mohanad Alaklouk, permanent representative of Palestine to the Arab League, said he was very happy to see the ancient buildings and experience the long-standing culture of the old town of Kashgar on his first trip to Xinjiang.The Chinese government has made huge efforts to renovate the old town and preserve its wonderful cultural heritage, and all these efforts and achievements are impressive, he said.Arab countries have consistently held a controversial position on the Xinjiang issue, stated Wang Wenbin, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman, adding that the genuine impressions of the Arab League delegation during their visit to Xinjiang once again fully demonstrate that the sinister plot of manipulating the Xinjiang issue to smear China is destined to fail.Global Times

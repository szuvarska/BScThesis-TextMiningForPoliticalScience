Another train derailed in Ohio on Saturday, which is the second such incident in the same state in about a month, further highlighting a serious crisis of confidence for the current US administration.The train derailment of about 20 cars of a 212-car train happened near Springfield and hazardous materials were not found and no causalities were reported, Reuters reported citing rail operator Norfolk Southern.
No causes for the derailment have been released.
Local officials had ordered residents living near the site to shelter in place.The accident recalled how the US poorly handled the latest disaster on February 3, when 50 cars, including 10 carrying hazardous materials, derailed in a fiery crash in East Palestine.
The incident caused the leakage of a large amount of toxic chemicals.
But US officials and mainstream media underplayed the incident and turned a blind eye to the threat it may cause to people.Chinese experts had warned that the chemical leak accident, "underestimated by the US," poses a serious safety hazard for Americans living in the affected area, with lingering effects of at least 20 years.
They also believe US authorities' "controlled burn" of the toxic gas could release more lethal substance into the environment, which they said fully exposed US government's irresponsible attitude toward people's health.The Ohio derailment will create a serious crisis of confidence in the current US administration, as Americans increasingly realize that the authorities cannot solve their problems.Rail accidents are common in the US where an average of about 1,700 train derailments occur each year, often due to technical reasons.
The railroad industry is woefully unregulated, and railroads always put profits ahead of safety, according to a Guardian report.

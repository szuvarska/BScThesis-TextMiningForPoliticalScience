Searches for outbound travel destinations on Chinese online platforms jumped 20-fold, just hours after the Ministry of Culture and Tourism on Thursday announcing the resumption of a third list of group tours to 78 countries including the US, Japan, Australia and India.Immediately following the announcement, searches for outbound travel jumped more than 20-fold on Chinese online travel platform Trip.com, according to data sent to the Global Times on Thursday.The report noted that outbound travel during the National Day holidays in early October were the most searched options, with countries such as Japan, Australia and New Zealand among the most popular destinations.
Meanwhile, the platform said it has received a large number of inquiries for overseas travel, over 10 times than daily average inquiries during this summer travel peak season.A manager from Trip.com said the company will launch outbound travel products to destinations including Japan, Australia and the US as soon as possible, with the first group tour for Japan scheduled in September, and a couple of others to Australia, Morocco and Israel around the National Day holidays.As investors bet on an accelerated recovery for the travel service industry, tourism and aviation shares rallied on Thursday.

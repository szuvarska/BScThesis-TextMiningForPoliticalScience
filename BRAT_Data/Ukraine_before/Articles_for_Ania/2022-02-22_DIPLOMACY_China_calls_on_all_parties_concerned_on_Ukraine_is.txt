China calls on all parties relevant on the Ukraine situation to continue dialogue and consultation and seek reasonable solutions to address each other's concerns on the basis of equality and mutual respect, Chinese Ambassador to UN Zhang Jun said.
The current situation in Ukraine is a result of many complex factors.
China always makes its position clear based on the matter itself.
We believe that all countries should solve international disputes by peaceful means in line with the principles of the UN Charter, Zhang said during an emergency Security Council meeting on Ukraine situation.

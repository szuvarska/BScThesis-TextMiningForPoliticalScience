The Chinese diplomatic mission in Ukraine is working normally and China calls on all parties to remain rational and refrain from inflaming tensions or hyping up the crisis, the Chinese Foreign Ministry said on Monday.
Wang Wenbin, spokesperson of the Chinese Foreign Ministry, made the remarks at Monday's media briefing.
He said China is closely following the situation in Ukraine.
The Chinese Embassy in Ukraine issued a reminder instructing local Chinese nationals and institutions to pay close attention to the situation in Ukraine and enhance security awareness.
The Chinese Foreign Ministry and embassy in Ukraine will continue to stay in close contact with Chinese citizens and institutions in Ukraine, provide timely consular protection and assistance and safeguard the safety and legitimate rights and interests of Chinese enterprises, Wang said.
Wang's remarks were made in response to questions on whether China is planning to evacuate its embassy staff or citizens from Ukraine.
Wang said all parties should push for a comprehensive settlement of the Ukrainian crisis through dialogue and negotiation.
We call on all parties to remain rational and refrain from stirring up tensions or hyping up the crisis, he said.
China believes in order to solve the Ukrainian issue, we should return to the Minsk-II agreement, which is a basic political document recognized by all parties and should be earnestly implemented, Wang said.As for Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison's remarks calling on China not to be "chillingly silent" on the crisis, Wang urged Australia to abandon its Cold War mentality and ideological bias and stop making bellicose statements that heightened tensions.
It is immoral and dangerous to seek political gains by advocating confrontation, Wang said.Global Times

The secessionist DPP authority's so-called "sympathy" for Ukraine's situation is 'self-serving,' Ma Xiaoguang, spokesperson for the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council, commented on Wednesday.The DPP authority has been playing along the US and Western rhetoric and exploiting the Ukraine issue to maliciously hype the so-called "military coercion" from the Chinese mainland, behind which hides their evil intentions of "internationalizing" the Taiwan question and inciting "anti-China" sentiments on the island, Ma said.Ma said it is entirely a political manipulation by the DPP for its own selfish interests.The spokesperson reiterated that the island of Taiwan is an inalienable part of China, and that the Taiwan question is purely China's domestic affair.Ma stressed that the DPP authority and the secessionists on the island colliding with external forces are the root cause of the tension across the Taiwan Straits.All the necessary actions Beijing has taken to safeguard China's national sovereignty and territorial integrity are aimed at stopping secessionist activities and interference by external forces, with the purpose of fundamentally safeguarding the vital interests of the compatriots on both sides of the Taiwan Strait and the overall interests of the Chinese people, Ma said.Global Times

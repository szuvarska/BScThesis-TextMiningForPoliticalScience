Spreading false information and creating a tense atmosphere won't help solve the Ukraine crisis, while advocating for group confrontation and wielding the sanctions stick will only add obstacles to dialogue and negotiation, China's Foreign Ministry commented on the US' hyping of a potential Russian invasion of Ukraine.
Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova commented on the Western countries' disinformation about Ukraine at a news briefing on Wednesday that she had not "seen such a number of fakes, misinformation, stuffing, slander and lies in a consolidated form for a long time," adding that the volume of Western media misinformation around Ukraine has exceeded the number of fakes on the situation in Syria.
Meanwhile, the US is still hyping up the remaining risk of Russian aggression against Ukraine.
US President Biden said Tuesday that a Russian invasion of Ukraine "remains distinctly possible," according to US media reports.
Wang Wenbin, spokesperson of the Chinese Foreign Ministry, said at a press briefing on Thursday that spreading false information and creating a tense atmosphere won't help solve the Ukraine problem while advocating for group confrontation and wielding the sanctions stick will only add obstacles to dialogue and negotiation.
The US should take it seriously to address Russia's legitimate concerns on issues of security and play a constructive role in seeking a political settlement of the Ukraine issue on the basis of the new Minsk agreement, rather than hyping up the crisis and causing tension, Wang said.
Wang stressed that China supports all efforts in line with the direction and spirit of the new Minsk agreement.

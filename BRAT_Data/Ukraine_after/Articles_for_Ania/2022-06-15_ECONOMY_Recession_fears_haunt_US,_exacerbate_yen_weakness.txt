Editor's Note: As the US moves to corner the countries it considers a thorn in its side, with its role as the initiator of the Ukraine crisis and tariff wars raging on multiple fronts, Uncle Sam has not only hurt the interests of many other countries, but has entrenched itself in an inescapable cause of unchecked global inflation.
This is the first article of a multi-part series on the US' exporting of economic crises to the world.
With consumer inflation climbing to a record 40-year high in May, the US may have no choice but to swallow a bitter pill of even sharper rate hikes.
The aggressive monetary tightening is envisioned to tip the US economy into recession, analysts have claimed, cautioning against the unpleasant repercussions for its allies, especially Japan that has seen its yen-denominated assets take a battering from an unfolding US recession scenario.The global market has been on edge in the past few days, as record US inflation data has stoked fears of a drastic rate hike at the US Federal Reserve's June policy meeting on Wednesday.The possibility of rate increases has added to concerns about recession in the US, which has struggled to curb runaway inflation.
A more hawkish Fed that leads global monetary tightening could be a problem for the Japanese economy, market watchers said, as a worryingly weak yen in the wake of an aggressive tightening push would lead to severe recession risks.Recession fears spook marketsThe US has recorded its hottest inflation data in four decades, with the consumer price index climbing to 8.6 percent in the year through May.The fresh 40-year high despite the Fed's desperate 50-basis point rate hike at its May policy meeting - the biggest in 22 years - has primed the market for a potential rate increase of 75 basis points at the upcoming meeting.
"The Fed hasn't hiked rates by three quarters of a percent since 1994, and tightening of this magnitude is fueling concerns of reduced consumer spending and business activity," said a Bloomberg report on Monday.
A hawkish stance has emerged among central banks in developed countries, expect for Japan, with an ensuing massive correction for the stock, bond, virtual currency and commodity markets, as the phantom of inflation has haunted the global economy, Wu Jinduo, head of fixed income at the research institute of Great Wall Securities in Shanghai, told the Global Times on Tuesday.Concerns over a toll on economic activity in the event of sharper rate hikes have roiled the US market and resulted in bond yields surging across the board.The Dow fell for a fourth straight session on Monday, bringing its year-to-date losses to 16 percent, while the NASDAQ has plunged 30.91 percent this year as of Monday.The US 30-year Treasury yield has climbed to its highest in more than three years.
In addition, an inverted yield curve re-occurred on Monday, with the two-year Treasury yield topping the 10-year rate again since April.
The yield on the five-year Treasury was also 17 basis points higher than the 30-year rate, the biggest inversion in 20 years.Bond yields hitting multiple-year highs and a yield curve inversion are considered precursors of an economic recession.The inversion in multiple parts of the yield curve is an indication that the market is pricing in inflation, Wu said.The US economy is heading for a recession as early as the end of 2023 or early 2024, according to estimates by Xiong Yuan, chief economist at Guosheng Securities, in April when the previous inverted yield curve occurred.Yen weakness The Fed's aggressive hiking road map has slammed most global markets, and the Japanese market has been among the hardest-hit, with its equity, bond and foreign exchange markets all crashing.Japan's Nikkei index lost for a fourth day on Wednesday, closing 1.14 percent lower, amid jitters over risks to growth from US monetary tightening.
A selloff is also feeding through Japanese bonds and the yen.The Japanese currency that has long been billed as a safe haven asset is now one of the worst-performing major global currencies.
The yen weakened beyond the key 135 level against the US dollar intraday on Monday, hitting the weakest level in over 20 years.
The yen's year-to-date depreciation against the US dollar has been nearing 17 percent.
The yen's fall to a fresh 20-year low has been attributed to the Japanese central bank's deviation from its developed peers.
Instead of shifting to a cycle of monetary tightening, the Japanese central bank has maintained an easing policy, Wu said, noting that the US-led cycle of rate hikes versus Japan's monetary easing has led to the yen's current weakness.
If the yen slides to as far as 150 against the dollar, turmoil on the scale of the 1997 Asian financial crisis is likely, Bloomberg reported earlier in June, citing veteran economist Jim O'Neill.
Another factor behind the falling yen and a rout in Japanese stocks and bonds is sluggish fundamentals in the Japanese economy, experts said.Japan's economic recovery is evidently slower than that of the US and EU, in part due to semiconductor and parts supply bottlenecks, the Omicron spread that impeded a revival of Japan's services consumption and rising global commodity prices that pushed up costs, Dong Chengxi, a research fellow with Zhixin Investment Research Institute, told the Global Times on Tuesday.Such woes are compounded by the Japanese central bank's continuation of a loose stance while the US hardens toward more aggressive tightening.
The European Central Bank also shifted toward raising rates in July, Dong noted.The resultant weak economic prospects, waning company earnings and massive capital outflows have led to a downtrend in Japanese yen-denominated assets, according to the analyst.

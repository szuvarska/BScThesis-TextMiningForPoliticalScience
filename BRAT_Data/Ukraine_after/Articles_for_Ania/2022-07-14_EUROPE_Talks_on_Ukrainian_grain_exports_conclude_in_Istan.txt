First round of the discussions between Russia, Ukraine, Turkey and the United Nations aiming to deliver stranded Ukrainian grain into the global market concluded in Istanbul on Wednesday.The Turkish Defence Ministry announced the end of the talks on Twitter without disclosing any immediate results or whether the talks will continue.The meeting came at a time when global food prices have soared with growing concerns about food shortages due to the prolonged crisis in Ukraine.The ministry reported earlier that during the meeting, the delegates would work on creating a safe corridor on the Black Sea to transfer grain from Ukrainian ports.Turkey has long been playing a role of mediation, seeking ways to establish a mechanism that will prevent a food crisis by allowing Ukraine to export its grains to the global market via sea routes.Ankara also expects Istanbul to become an operational hub where the entire shipment process will be conducted.

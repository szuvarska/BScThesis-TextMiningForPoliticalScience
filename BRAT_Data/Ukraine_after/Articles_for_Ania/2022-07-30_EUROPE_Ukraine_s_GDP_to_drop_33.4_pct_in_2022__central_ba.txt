Ukraine's gross domestic product (GDP) will drop by 33.4 percent this year amid the Russia-Ukraine conflict, the National Bank of Ukraine said on Friday.The present military conflict, the loss of lives and the population outflow from the country are the main factors behind the decline, the bank said on Facebook.In its baseline forecast, the bank said that Ukraine's nominal GDP will shrink from 5.46 trillion hryvnias (about 149.3 billion US dollars) in 2021 to 4.54 trillion hryvnias (124.1 billion dollars) in 2022.

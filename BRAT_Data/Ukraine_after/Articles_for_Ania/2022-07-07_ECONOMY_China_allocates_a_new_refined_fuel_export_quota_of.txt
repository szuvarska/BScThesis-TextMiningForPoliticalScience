However, export value increased 2.3 percent year-on-year.Lin said that China's export of refined fuel products has had only a slight impact on the global economy given its small amount.After hitting a 10-week high at more than $125 per barrel in mid-June, Brent crude futures have ceded ground in volatile trading as concerns over a global economic slowdown trumped the impact of Western sanctions on Russian oil supplies, S&P Global reported.As of 10 am Thursday, Brent crude futures slid 1.9 percent to $98.95 per barrel, their closest to $100 per barrel since April 26.
US West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures dropped 1.74 percent to $96.82 per barrel.Lin forecast that international oil price may hover at around $100 per barrel with improved expectations for global economy.
"The international oil price may drop to around $70-80 per barrel if the Russia-Ukraine crisis is resolved," he said.Global Times

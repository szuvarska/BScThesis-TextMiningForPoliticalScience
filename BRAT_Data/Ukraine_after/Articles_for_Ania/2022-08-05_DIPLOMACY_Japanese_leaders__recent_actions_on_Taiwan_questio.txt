Japanese leaders' recent actions on Taiwan question are not friendly and have disappointed China very much, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying said at a press conference on Friday, noting that some countries are making groundless accusations against China and spreading disinformation and Japan is among those taking "very wrong actions.
"On Friday, US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi had a meeting with the Japanese leader Fumio Kishida, during which Kishida strongly criticized China's military drills for it "threatened Japan" and "impacted peace and stability" of the region, Kyodo News reported.At Friday's press conference, Kyodo News asked Hua about State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi's leaving his seat with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov as Japan criticized China's military drills and Russia's conflict with Ukraine on a ministerial meeting with ASEAN in Phnom Penh on Friday.
Hua noted that certain countries made groundless accusations against China during the ministerial meeting with ASEAN members, while the majority of countries expressed understanding on China.
Wang refuted disinformation and defended justice at the site.
"I hope Kyodo News can remind your government.
Your leaders have acted very unfriendly recently on Taiwan question, which has disappointed China very much," Hua said, noting that China has said that Japan had done wrong things in history in the island of Taiwan and has no right to point fingers on China on the Taiwan question.
China has reiterated its stance on the Taiwan question and made it clear that the current situation in the Taiwan Straits was caused by US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi for she insisted on visiting the island of Taiwan despite China's firm and repeated warnings.Japan has turned a blind eye on US' violations of China's sovereignty but jumped out to accuse China in attempt to turn black to white and cause trouble on the Taiwan question with the purpose to counter China's development, hinder its reunification, Hua said, noting all these efforts are in vain.
"We hope to deliver this message to Japan," Hua told Kyodo News reporter.

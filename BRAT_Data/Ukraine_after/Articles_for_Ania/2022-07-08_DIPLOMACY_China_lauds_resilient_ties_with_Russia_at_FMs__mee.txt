China and Russia overcame obstacles, maintained normal exchanges and pushed forward cooperation in various fields in an orderly manner, showing the strong resilience and strategic determination in bilateral ties amid emerging global challenges, Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi said during a meeting with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov on the sidelines of the Group of 20 (G20) foreign ministers' meeting in Bali, Indonesia, on Thursday.
Wang said it is the shared aspiration of developing countries to oppose hegemony, bullying and unilateralism.Facing the realities of the current international politics, will countries choose to pursue power politics and hegemony, or promote a multi-polar world?
Wang asked.
Will they truly uphold the international order with the UN at its core or follow rules made by a handful of countries according to their own standards?
Wang said he believes more and more countries will have a clearer view of this and make the right choice as time goes by.Lavrov said Russia and China have played an important role in safeguarding the United Nations Charter and international law, promoting a fairer international order and pushing for more democratic international relations by upholding responsible stances and maintaining strategic collaboration, which is recognized and supported by developing countries.The Russia-China relations are not subject to external interference and the practical cooperation between the two countries is advancing smoothly with a great potential for further development, Lavrov said.
Russia is ready to expand the area and scale of cooperation between the two countries, so as to better benefit the two peoples, he said.
The two sides discussed the Ukraine situation.
Wang said China will continue holding an objective and just position, focusing on de-escalating the situation and promoting peace talks, and supporting all efforts conducive to the peaceful settlement of the crisis.China stands ready to work with all sides to implement the China-proposed Global Security Initiative and practice the vision of common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security, Wang said.Wang said China is ready to work with other BRICS members, including Russia, to implement the major results achieved at the summit and speed up the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, so as to safeguard the common interests of developing countries, and uphold international equality and justice.Both sides agreed to support Indonesia in successfully hosting the G20 foreign ministers' meeting, and also strengthen cooperation within the framework of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization.Wang was scheduled to attend the G20 foreign ministers' meeting on Thursday and Friday.

On Sharm el-Sheikh's sandy beaches many of the sun loungers lie empty.
At a central promenade packed with shops, cafes and nightclubs, crowds are thinner than usual.The resort on the southern tip of Egypt's Sinai Peninsula is reeling from the impact of the war in Ukraine, which has seen Ukrainians and Russians - 足previously among the town's top visitors - virtually disappear, tourism sector workers say.Their absence has delivered the latest in a series of shocks to a sector that accounts for up to 15 percent of gross domestic product and generates sorely needed foreign currency.
"Months ago, we were catching our breath after coronavirus hit and activity was beginning to recover, but we got out of the frying pan into the fire," said the owner of a small souvenir shop on the main promenade in Sharm el-Sheikh's Naama Bay who gave his name as Ashraf, adding that he'd lost about two-thirds of his business.Egypt's tourism revenues dipped sharply during the 足COVID-19 pandemic, recovering to nearly $12 billion in 2021, according to central bank data.The sector had received a boost when Russia resumed direct flights to Sharm el-Sheikh and fellow Red Sea resort Hurghada in August 2021, six years after the crash of a passenger jet carrying Russian tourists led to their suspension.Though no updated data is available for this year, a briefing by the cabinet last month warned of a major hit to foreign currency income from tourism.The government, which is also struggling with rising wheat and oil import bills, recently revised its growth forecast for the financial year ending this month down to 5.5 percent, and for 2022-23 to 4.5 percent.

Nearly all the 20,000 Ukrainians in Egyptian resorts at the outbreak of the war have been flown out.
"We lost about 70 percent of occupancy after the war," said the manager of one large hotel who declined to be named as he was not authorized to speak to media.
"There's a slight rise in numbers from Armenia and Romania, but none of these numbers can be compared with those from Ukraine and Russia before the war.
"Just 1,500-2,000 Russians have been arriving each week, said Adel Hosny, the South Sinai contracting manager for Russia-based tour operator Pegas Touristik.Demand dropped as Western sanctions drove up travel times and costs from Russia by forcing carriers to change routes, and MasterCard and Visa credit cards issued in 足Russia stopped working abroad.
Daily flights are expected to resume from Russia from early July.Spending by those Russians still coming to Sharm el-Sheikh had dwindled because they had limited access to dollars, said Ahmed Akrab, a tour guide.

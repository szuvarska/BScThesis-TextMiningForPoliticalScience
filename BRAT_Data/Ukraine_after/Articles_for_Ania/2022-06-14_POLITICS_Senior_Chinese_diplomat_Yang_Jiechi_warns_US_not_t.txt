In talks with National Security Advisor of the US Jake Sullivan in Luxembourg, senior Chinese diplomat Yang Jiechi said the US shouldn't have miscalculation or illusion on the Taiwan question and warned that the Taiwan question, if inappropriately handled, will have a disruptive impact.The two held "frank, deep and constructive" dialogue and communication on questions that concern both, agreeing to strengthen communication and dialogue, reduce misunderstanding and miscalculation, and properly manage differences.
Both of them said it is necessary and beneficial to keep communication channels open.Yang noted that US President Joe Biden had repeatedly stated that the US has no intention to seek a new Cold War or change China's system, that the revitalization of US alliances is not anti-China, that the US does not support "Taiwan independence," and that it is not looking for conflict or confrontation with China.However, the reality is that the US has been determined to step up all-round containment and repression against China for some time now.
It doesn't solve US' domestic problems, but plunged China-US relations into a very difficult situation, greatly damaging bilateral exchanges and cooperation.Such a situation is not in the interests of China, the US and the rest of the world, Yang noted.Yang is a member of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee and director of the Office of the Foreign Affairs Commission of the CPC Central Committee.China-US relations are at a critical crossroads, Yang said, notingthatChina is willing to approach China-US relations based on mutual respect, peaceful coexistence and win-win cooperation.
China firmly opposes defining China-US relations as competition.The senior Chinese diplomat said the US should correct its strategic perception of China to make the right choice, and adopt concrete actions to meet China half-way.In their talks,Yang stressed the Taiwan question concerns political foundation of China-US relations.
It will have disruptive impacts if it is inappropriately handled.The US shouldn't have miscalculation or illusion on this.
It must abide by the One-China principle and the provisions of the three China-US joint communiques, and handle Taiwan related questions carefully and properly.China's position on safeguarding national sovereignty and territorial integrity is unequivocal and firm.
China's internal affairs brook no interference from other countries.
Any attempt to obstruct or undermine China's national unity will be doomed to fail, Yang said.The US should have positive interactions with China and make joint efforts for the prosperity, stability and development of the Asia-Pacific region.In their talks, Yang also expressed China's solemn position on Xinjiang, Hong Kong, Xizang, the South China Sea, human rights, religion and other issues.
They exchanged views on Ukraine and the nuclear issues on Korean Peninsula.Global Times

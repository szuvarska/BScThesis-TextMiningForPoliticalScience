I asked them to deliver their best.
We had really hard training in the past seven months and it's all deserved," Zhang added.The other sensation of the day was the new world record set by local favorite Kristof Milak in the men's 200 meters butterfly as Milak timed 1:50.34 to beat his own record of 1:50.73 created at the 2019 World Championships in Gwangju, South Korea, on July 23, 2019.This is Hungary's first gold at the worlds and Leon Marchand of France finished second by 1:53.37 and Tomoru Honda of Japan third in 1:53.61.Defending champion Caeleb Dressel of the US pulled out of the 100 meters freestyle semifinals and mixed medley relay just before the session.In the men's 800 meters freestyle, Bobby Finke of the United States won by 7:39.36, beating Florian Wellbrock of Germany (7:39.63) and Mykhailo Romanchuk of Ukraine (7:40.05).Nic Fink won the second gold of the day for the US in men's 50 meters breaststroke with a time of 26.45 seconds, narrowly beating Italian Nicolo Martinenghi's 26.48 and teammate Michael Andrew's 26.72.The last final of Tuesday was the mixed 4x100 meters medley relay, which was won by Team USA by 3:38.79.

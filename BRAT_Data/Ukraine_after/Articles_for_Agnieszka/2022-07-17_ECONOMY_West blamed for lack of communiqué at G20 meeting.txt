The G20 countries should promote the mechanism's role as a key platform for global economic cooperation and curb serious negative spillover effect of the policy adjustments by certain countries, China's Finance Minister Liu Kun said during a video speech at the third G20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors (FMCBG) Meeting over the weekend.The meeting, held in Indonesia's Bali resort island with finance leaders from the world's major economies seeking ways to tackle global economic threats, ended up without a joint statement despite finance chiefs' pledge to address global food insecurity and rising debt.China is committed to further global development partnerships; work on comprehensive poverty alleviation; safeguard global grain and energy security, and promote cooperation in public health, according to a statement posted on the MOF website on Saturday.To actively promote China-proposed Global Development Initiative (GDI), China plans to donate $50 million to the newly launched fund on Pandemic Prevention, Preparedness and Response at the World Bank, according to Liu.The G20 meeting was held at a critical time with many emerging market countries facing elevated debts and the world facing a grain and energy supply crisis in the wake of the Russia-Ukraine conflict.Issues highlighted for discussion at the meeting include global supply chain disruptions and rising commodity prices, revitalization of the global health architecture, debt management for poor countries, and financial policy normalization, among others.
However, finance ministers and central bankers failed to issue a formal communiqué.
Li Yong, deputy chairman of the Expert Committee of the China Association of International Trade, a think tank affiliated with China's Ministry of Commerce, told the Global Times on Sunday that failing to issue a formal communiqué showed that a number of Western countries' attempt to impose their views about the Russia-Ukraine conflict on others at the G20 meeting has failed, due to the fact that many G20 countries have their independent position and opinion on the matter.
"The efforts by the West to hijack the important meeting with their political correctness in face of pressing global issues are in stark contrast with China's responsible move by offering donations to the World Bank fund," Li said.
"China's actions beat the rhetoric of certain Western countries," Li said.People's Bank of China Governor Yi Gang and Deputy Governor Chen Yulu also attended the meeting via video link.It is important to support the role of G20 as the premier forum for international economic cooperation by upholding multilateralism and strengthening policy coordination to preserve price stability and avoid negative spillovers of policy adjustments by some countries, and, collective efforts to deploy supportive policy measures are essential to address the global challenges, according to a PBC statement on Saturday.

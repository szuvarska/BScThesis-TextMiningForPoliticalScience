China's Foreign Ministry said on Wednesday that it has lodged stern representations with the US side after the latter blacklisted five Chinese companies for allegedly supporting Russia, while urging Washington to withdraw the unilateral sanctions and vowing to defend Chinese firm's interests.
The US' clampdown on Chinese firms for allegedly supporting Russia's military and defense industrial base is unilateral sanction and long-arm jurisdiction that violates international law and lacks approval from the UN Security Council, Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Zhao Lijian said at a regular press briefing in Beijing.
"China and Russia engage in normal economic and trade cooperation on an equal footing with mutual respect and benefits and it shouldn't be intervened in or restricted by any third party," Zhao stressed.The Chinese side urges the US to immediately correct its mistakes and withdraw relevant sanctions, he said, noting that China will take necessary measures to firmly safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese companies.The US Commerce Department added five Chinese enterprises to a trade blacklist, claiming that these companies had supplied items to Russian entities of concern before February 24, and they "continue to contract to supply Russian entity listed and sanctioned parties," Reuters reported.In a statement sent to the Global Times on Wednesday, the Chinese Embassy in the US said that China has not provided military assistance to parties involved in the Russia-Ukraine conflict and will firmly oppose sanctions on Chinese companies imposed by the US.
"China's position on the Ukrainian issue is consistent and clear.
We have been playing a constructive role in promoting peace talks and have not provided military assistance to the conflicting parties," the embassy stressed.According to a document released by the US Federal Register, the five companies are Connec Electronic, World Jetta (Hong Kong) Logistics Ltd, King Pai Technology, Winninc Electronic and Sinno Electronics Co Ltd, covering sectors of electronic parts and logistics.Connec Electronic and World Jetta (Hong Kong) Logistics Ltd couldn't be reached for comment as of press time on Wednesday, while the other three companies didn't immediately comment on the issue when reached by the Global Times.Qi Kai, an expert on international political economy at China University of Political Science and Law, told the Global Times that the US' move is aimed at seeking to expand its sanctions on Russia to China.
"While the US escalates pressure on Russia since the Russia-Ukraine conflict, it is also ramping up measures targeted China," Qi said, adding that by involving China in topics about the Russia-Ukraine conflict, the US attempts to target both in one move.However, against the backdrop of severe global inflation and disrupted industrial and supply chains, the US' reckless move will further weigh on US companies that are under concerns over potential US economic recession sparked by sizeable interest rate hikes, Li Yong, deputy chairman of the Expert Committee of the China Association of International Trade, a think tank affiliated with the Chinese Ministry of Commerce, told the Global Times.A "China-US decoupling" is not in the economic interest of either side, as China remains an attractive investment destination and the top priority market for nearly two-thirds of members in the American Chamber of Commerce in China, Colm Rafferty, president of the chamber, said in a recent video conference held by the Ministry of Commerce.

Editor's Note:The impact of COVID-19 is still being felt, the Russia-Ukraine conflict has lasted for more than 100 days, globalization is increasingly going reverse, unilateral sanctions and scientific and technological barriers are prevalentâ€¦ all these have had a serious impact on the economic and social development of emerging markets and developing countries.
The world is also facing challenges in achieving the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development with worsening food insecurity and poverty, widening North-South gap in development and growing global development deficit.Under these circumstances, the BRICS countries - Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa - which account for more than 40 percent of the world's population and about 25 percent of global GDP, are focusing on the two major issues of development and security, are injecting stability and positive energy into international relations and are becoming a positive and constructive force in today's international relations.

Forty-five more bodies of dead soldiers have been returned to Ukraine as part of another exchange with Russia, Ukraine's Ministry of Reintegration of the Temporarily Occupied Territories said Tuesday.The operation to exchange the bodies of the soldiers killed in the Russia-Ukraine conflict was carried out by joint efforts of Ukraine's Commissioner for Missing Persons Oleg Kotenko and the country's law enforcement agencies, the ministry's press service said in a statement on Tuesday.Last week, Kotenko said that about 7,200 Ukrainian servicemen went missing in the more than four months of conflict with Russia.

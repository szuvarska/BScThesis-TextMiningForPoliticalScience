The Ukrainian parliament on Monday unveiled a draft law to impose new sanctions on Russia, the Interfax-Ukraine news agency reported.The bill, which was submitted by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, envisages 10 new restrictive measures to be introduced against Russia for the next 10 years.In particular, the draft law stipulates a ban on transferring funds from Ukraine to Russia-related individuals and legal entities.
Besides, it prohibits Russia-linked individuals from participating in the privatization and lease of Ukrainian state property and purchasing land plots in Ukraine.
The bill also proposes to ban Russian and Russia-linked ships and planes from entering Ukraine, among other measures.Ukraine and Russia have exchanged accusations over a strike on the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant (NPP), which is one of the largest atomic power complexes in Europe and generates a quarter of Ukraine's total electricity.The Russian defense ministry said Monday that Ukraine's shelling of the Zaporizhzhia NPP was an act of "nuclear terrorism.
"As a result of the strike, Ukrainian forces damaged a high-voltage line, which supplied electricity to the Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions, it said in a statement.Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Monday that the shelling of the nuclear plant's territory by the Ukrainian forces was "extremely dangerous," adding that such actions could lead to "catastrophic consequences" for all of Europe.Ukraine's state-run nuclear energy operator Energoatom on Sunday accused Russian forces of shelling the power plant, saying the latest rocket attacks on Saturday hit the area next to the plant's dry storage facility, where 174 containers with spent nuclear fuel were stored in the open air.

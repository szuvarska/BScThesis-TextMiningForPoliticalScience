Facts have repeatedly shown that any country that embraces Cold-War mentality and has a penchant for confrontation will not succeed, but will only backfire on itself and negatively impact global peace and security, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said Wednesday in Beijing.Wang made the comment in response to a senior US official who sees sanctioning curbs on exports to Russia as "a template" to counter China.
"The US's successful collaboration with 37 other nations that's driven down exports to Russia serves as a blueprint for a new regime on tackling threats from China," according to a Bloomberg report, citing the head of the Commerce Department's Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS).
"When US officials talk about restricting exports to Russia, they use the word 'success' to describe the attempt.
I don't know where the so-called success comes from?"
Wang Wenbin told a regular press conference in Beijing on Wednesday.
"What the world sees clearly is that the US is currently facing its most severe inflation in 40 years.
The elevated food and energy prices in the US have driven the American people miserable, and the sentiment of American consumers has dropped to the lowest point since 1952," Wang said.Moreover, the world's stock market, forex market, crude oil, natural gas, grain and non-ferrous metal markets have all gone volatile lately, which has greatly affected the people of all countries, especially those in developing countries with weak economic foundations, the spokesperson noted.A poll shows that 85 percent of American adults believe that the US is headed in the wrong direction.
As the initiator of the Ukraine crisis, the US has kept on aggravating conflict, wielding club of economic sanctions, and engaging in economic coercions, which not only undermined the normal exchanges between countries, violated the norms of international trade, but also complicated and exacerbated the Ukrainian crisis, Wang added.Global Times

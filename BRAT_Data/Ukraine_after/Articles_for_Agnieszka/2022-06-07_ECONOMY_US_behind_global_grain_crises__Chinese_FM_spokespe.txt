Zhao Lijian Photo: VCG  Each global grain crisis has the shadow of the US behind it, a spokesperson for China's Foreign Ministry said on Monday, after international organizations warned of an impending global grain crisis.A small number of countries led by the US have been manipulating the global grain trade, setting up a "grain hegemony" and holding firm control on global grain prices, Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian told a regular press conference.
Repeatedly, these powers have sought huge profits by making a publicity stunt out of grain security and fanning tensions on grain supply, Zhao said.The US has been accusing other countries of hoarding grain, and demanding they release grain stockpiles, while not scaling back an inch in its programs to convert grain into energy, the spokesperson said.
In the meantime, it profiteers from high grain prices in a totally irresponsible manner, said Zhao.Zhao made the remarks after recent warnings from the African Union and the UN World Food Programme.The head of the African Union, Senegalese President Macky Sall, called for the food sector to be left "out of the sanctions.
"In a May 4 report, the World Food Programme said the conflict in Ukraine has inflated food commodity prices that were already at record highs in March on top of steep increases in 2021 and early 2022.
The report said 44 million people around the world are facing the threat of famine.Zhao pointed out that the global food supply is becoming extremely tight, with major grain exporters Russia and Ukraine out of the game due to the conflict.
US-led sanctions against Russia, which seriously crippled Russian food and fertilizer exports, have further worsened the situation, Zhao said.The right to live is the foremost human right and fighting hunger is the common goal of mankind, he said, noting that the international community should foster and restore peace through negotiation and create a peaceful and stable environment to tackle the global food crisis.Adding fuel to the flames and abuse of sanctions will not help in diffusing regional tensions and will only worsen the food crisis, leading to even bigger humanitarian disasters, the spokesperson said.Global Times

Looking back at the year that is about to pass, everyone has developed a deeper understanding of the major assertion that "the world is experiencing a transformation unseen in a century, and it is accelerating.
"Throughout 2023, the international security situation remains severe, with the Ukraine crisis still unresolved and renewed conflict between Israel and Palestine.
The global economy is on a post-pandemicÂ  path to recovery, but the pace remains slow and uneven, combating inflation remains a top priority for many economies; issues like climate change, artificial intelligence, and the food crisis continue to call for global unity and collaboration.
However, notions such as "decoupling" and "de-risk" keep adding risks of division to the international order.Faced with the turbulent, rapidly evolving global situation, and the profound questions of where humanity is headed historically, globally, and through the ages, China has presented its answer through the concept of Chinese modernization.
China has achieved its first centennial goal and is marching toward building a great modern socialist country, fulfilling its second centennial goal.
Chinese modernization encapsulates both the summary of historical success and has become the "keyword" for the comprehensive promotion of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation in the new era.In an era filled with both challenges and opportunities, Chinese modernization will become a key to understanding the interaction between China and the world.

The European Parliament's attacks and smears against the boarding schools in Xizang are actually a kind of violation of children's right to education, which is damaging to the human rights conditions in Southwest China's Xizang Autonomous Region, the Chinese Foreign Ministry stated on Tuesday.The remarks were made by Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin during a regular press conference on Tuesday, when asked about the European Parliament's resolution on Thursday criticizing the human rights condition in boarding schools in Xizang.Wang said that Xizang now enjoys a booming economy, harmonious and stable society, and effective protection and promotion of cultural heritage.
The rights and freedoms of all ethnic groups, including the freedom of religious belief and the freedom to use and develop their own spoken and written languages, are fully protected, Wang said.The human rights conditions in Xizang are better than ever, as witnessed by the international community.
In the case of Xizang, due to highly scattered population, children have to travel long distances to get to school, which is very inconvenient.
If schools were to be built in every place the students live, it would be very difficult to ensure adequate teachers and quality of teaching in each school.
That is why local governments set up boarding schools according to actual needs to ensure all children's equal right to education, the spokesperson noted.Wang emphasized that it is entirely up to the students and their parents whether to go to boarding schools or not.
Students can choose to go home on every weekend, holiday and festival, as well as during the winter and summer breaks.
Parents can visit their children at school any time and take their children home whenever needed.Besides, relevant schools open courses of traditional culture, such as Tibetan language and literature and folk dance, provided traditional food unique to the Xizang Plateau, and students are allowed to wear traditional dresses at school, Wang added.
"The European Parliament's attacks and smears against these boarding schools in Xizang are actually a kind of violation of the children's right to education, which is damaging to the human rights conditions in Xizang," Wang noted.According to Wang, what's said in the relevant resolution of the European Parliament is disinformation.
It smears China's image and interferes in China's internal affairs.
"We deplore and strongly oppose this, and we urge the European Parliament to stop spreading disinformation, stop using Xizang-related issues to interfere in China's internal affairs and stop all words and deeds that might undermine the mutual trust and cooperation between China and Europe," Wang said.The spokesperson said that in recent years, in European countries, we have seen growing violation of the rights of refugees and migrants, growing xenophobia and racism, inadequate attention to economic, social and cultural rights as well as the right to development, and selective application and double standards when it comes to freedom of the press and forced labor.
"If the European Parliament truly cares about human rights, it should address Europe's own issues first and pay attention to human rights violations in places like Gaza, rather than apply double standard and selective negligence, and instrumentalize and weaponize the human rights issue," Wang said.Global Times

China opposes any forcible transfer of the Palestinian people from the Gaza Strip, and all measures must be taken to alleviate the humanitarian catastrophe and make a cease-fire the most urgent task of the moment, China's permanent representative to the UN Zhang Jun said during a UN Security Council conference on Friday local time.An immediate ceasefire has become the overwhelming call of the international community, but a permanent member of UN Security Council (UNSC) has vetoed the consensus reached by the UNSC in this regard on various grounds, which is a blatant defiance of international fairness, justice and the authority of UNSC, Zhang said.The UNSC failed to adopt a draft resolution on December 8, 2023 that would have demanded an immediate humanitarian ceasefire in Gaza due to a veto cast by the US.
Many countries expressed disappointment over the US veto of the Gaza-related draft.It is a blatant double standard for some people to talk about the protection of human rights and the prevention of genocide while pretending to be deaf and dumb, covering up and diverting attention from the tragic situation in Gaza, Zhang remarked, "We must remove all interference and take vigorous action to quell the war, save lives and restore peace.
"In addition, Zhang stressed that that any forcible transfer of the Palestinian people must be firmly rejected.Over the past three months, millions of Palestinian people have been forced to relocate repeatedly and were under constant threat to their lives, said Zhang, noting that China is gravely concerned about the "voluntary emigration" of Gaza people, which has been advocated by some Israeli politicians.The horrific idea of displacing two million people from Gaza and turning it into a "safe zone" devoid of human habitation, if implemented, would constitute a grave crime under international law and completely destroy prospects for the "Two-State solution," Zhang remarked.The Chinese envoy called for all measures to be taken to alleviate the humanitarian catastrophe in the Gaza Strip.Zhang said it was totally unacceptable for Israel to accuse the UN of not having the will and capacity to provide humanitarian relief when it was clear that Israel was accountable for the continued bombing and striking in Gaza and setting obstacles to the entry of humanitarian supplies.He urged Israel to immediately cease its indiscriminate military attacks and destruction of Gaza.UNSC resolutions 2712 and 2720 must be fully implemented, and Israel must fulfil its obligations as the occupying party to guarantee the safety of humanitarian workers and provide full cooperation with humanitarian relief efforts, Zhang said.The envoy reiterated that a ceasefire must be implemented with the utmost urgency.
"Only a ceasefire can prevent greater civilian casualties and humanitarian disasters and create conditions for the early release of all hostages; only a ceasefire can prevent the complete destruction of the basis of the Two-State solution; and only a ceasefire can prevent the entire Middle East region from being drawn into a catastrophe.
"Regarding the recent attacks launched by US and UK on Yemen against the Houthi rebels, which targeted Israeli-linked ships in the Red Sea, Zhang expressed concerns about the spillover effects of the Gaza crisis.Zhang said at a UNSC emergency conference on the Red Sea situation on the same day that the UNSC has never authorized any country to use force against Yemen.
The military action taken by the related countries runs counter to the UN resolution 2722, which the Security Council has just adopted.The envoy warned that the Middle East region is on the brink of extreme danger, and what should be avoided now is reckless military adventurism.
He added that what is needed most of all is calm and restraint to prevent further expansion of the conflict.China urges all parties concerned, especially the influential powers, to abide by the Charter of the UN and international law, adhere to the direction of dialogue and consultation, and make practical efforts to maintain peace and stability in the Red Sea and the Middle East region, Zhang said.The US carried out further strikes against Houthi targets in Yemen on Friday night a day after launching a coordinated multi-nation attack on nearly 30 Houthi locations.Global Times

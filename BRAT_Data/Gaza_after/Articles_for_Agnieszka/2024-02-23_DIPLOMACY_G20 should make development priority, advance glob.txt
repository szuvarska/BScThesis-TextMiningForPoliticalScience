The Group of 20 (G20) should adhere to its original mission of promoting international economic cooperation, improve the mechanism for macroeconomic policy cooperation, make development issues a priority , and cooperate to advance the reform of global economic governance, said Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Ma Zhaoxu, during the G20 Foreign Ministers' Meeting held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil on Wednesday and Thursday.The G20 should adhere to true multilateralism and support the UN and its security council to play a key role, to address global challenges, said Ma.The China-proposed Global Security Initiative stays committed to the vision of common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security, which is the fundamental principle for China to address international hotspot issues, said Ma.The current situation in Gaza is extremely critical, with the regional peace and stability severely affected.
The UN Security Council must fulfill its responsibilities mandated in the UN Charter, take immediate action to promote a cease-fire, and alleviate the humanitarian crisis, Ma noted.China calls for convening of a larger, more authoritative, and more effective international peace conference to work toward achieving lasting stability in the Middle East region.During the meeting, Ma also elaborated on China's position in addressing the situation in the Red Sea and the Ukraine crisis.Also at Wednesday's regular press briefing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning has stressed that the G20 is the premier forum for international economic cooperation, not a platform for resolving geopolitical and security issues.
"This is a G20 consensus.
We hope that the foreign ministers' meeting will help enhance solidarity and cooperation and contribute to global economic growth and development."

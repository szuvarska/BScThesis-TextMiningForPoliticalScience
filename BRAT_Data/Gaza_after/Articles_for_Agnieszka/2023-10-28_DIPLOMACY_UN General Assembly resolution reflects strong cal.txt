The UN General Assembly on Friday passed a non-binding resolution for humanitarian truce in Gaza by a vote of 120-14, and Chinese Ambassador Zhang Jun, Permanent Representative of China to the UN, said China welcomes the resolution and that its overwhelming vote in UN General Assembly reflects the strong call from the majority of member states for a ceasefire and an end to the conflict in the region.The resolution was proposed by Jordan in the name of 22 Arab countries, which called for "an immediate, durable and sustained humanitarian truce leading to a cessation of hostilities.
"The resolution demands that all parties comply with international law and protect civilians, calls on Israel to revoke the emergency evacuation order in the northern Gaza Strip, and opposes the forced displacement of Palestinian civilians.
The resolution reaffirms the need for a just and lasting solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict based on the "two-state solution."
It received 120 votes in favor among the 193-member UN General Assembly, and 14 against and 45 abstentions.
Israel and the US voted against the resolution for "failing" to mention Hamas.
France voted for the truce, while Germany, Italy and Britain abstained, according to media reports.China is a co-sponsor of this resolution and voted in favor.
Chinese Ambassador Zhang said that China hopes this resolution will be fully implemented and China highly appreciates and will continue to firmly support Arab and Islamic countries in playing a leading role in the Palestinian issue.Zhang said that since the outbreak of the new round of conflict between Palestine and Israel, China has been firmly opposed to and condemned all violence and attacks against civilians from the very beginning.
China strongly calls for the de-escalation of tensions and the immediate cessation of hostilities, and urges all diplomatic efforts of the international community to converge on this goal.
China is closely monitoring the humanitarian situation in the Gaza Strip, supports the opening of humanitarian corridors, and has provided emergency humanitarian assistance to the Gaza Strip,Â  Zhang said.The fundamental solution to the Palestinian issue lies in the establishment of an independent Palestinian state with full sovereignty on the basis of the 1967 borders and with east Jerusalem as its capital.
While the international community is engaged in crisis management in the new round, it must adhere to the fundamental direction of the "two-state solution," promote broader consensus, and develop a timetable and roadmap for this purpose.Zhang said that China will continue to stand on the side of peace, justice, and international law, and work tirelessly with all parties in the international community to achieve an early end to the Gaza conflict, achieve peaceful coexistence between Palestine and Israel, and achieve long-term stability in the Middle East.Global Times

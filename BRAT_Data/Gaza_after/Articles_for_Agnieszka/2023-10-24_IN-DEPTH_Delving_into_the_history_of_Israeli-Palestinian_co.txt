Editor's Note:As of October 22, over 1.4 million people were displaced and over 6,000 fatalities have been reported amid the latest round of the Israeli-Palestinian armed conflict.
Since the establishment of Israel in 1948, warns and armed conflicts have characterized relations between the two sides.
Historically, Jews and Arabs, who created concurrent Jewish and Arab civilizations respectively have, until the 20th century, coexisted peacefully before the emergence of seemingly irreconcilable differences.The Global Times will publish a series of in-depth reports on the "Past and Present of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict," exploring the historical, religious, and cultural clashes, delving into the various wars and internal struggles between Israelis and Palestinians, and analyzing the power struggles triggered by external influences from Europe and the US, in an attempt to clarify how the past has influenced the present Israeli-Palestinian conflict.One land, two names"We will not leave, we will not leave, we will not leave, and we will remain on our land," Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas said on Saturday when addressing the Cairo Peace Summit.
He warned of any attempts to displace people from the war-torn Gaza Strip, and attempts to displace Palestinians from their homes, media sources reported.
Following the outbreak of this round of conflict, Israel demanded that approximately 1.1 million residents in the northern Gaza evacuate to the south to facilitate military operations to eliminate the Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas).
"The Israeli-Palestinian conflict is a deep struggle, intertwined with historical and religious narratives that have shaped its course for generations," read a Fox News article on October 12.
"Central to this conflict is the land of historical and religious significance to both Jewish and Palestinian communities.
The Bible plays a pivotal role, with its promise of the land of Canaan to the descendants of Abraham.
For Jewish people, this territory represents the biblical Promised Land, where their forebears settled following their exodus from Egypt ... From a Palestinian perspective, their connection to the land is also rooted in biblical heritage, tracing their origins back to the ancient Canaanites and Philistines," read the Fox News article.Canaan, the ancient name for Palestine, lies at the intersection of three continents: Asia, Africa, and Europe, including what is now Israel, Jordan, Gaza, and the West Bank.
According to Israeli historical books, Semites who migrated from the Arabian Peninsula migrated to the area from about 3000 BC to 2500 BC, and both Semitic Jews and Arabs once lived here.According to publicly available information, ancient Jews originated in the Mesopotamian plain approximately 4,000 years ago.
They later migrated to the eastern coast of the Mediterranean, known as the Crescent, to escape natural disasters.
They then migrated again to the eastern part of the Nile Delta in Egypt due to famine.
According to Israeli historical books, around the first half of the 13th century BC, Jewish people, who were unwilling to be enslaved, left Egypt under the leadership of Moses and wandered in the Sinai Peninsula desert for more than 40 years before being led into Canaan by Joshua.
Similarly, in the late 13th century BC, another large group called the "Sea Peoples" or Philistines entered Canaan and named the land "Philistia," meaning "the land of the Philistines."
In the 5th century BC, Greek historians began using the term "Palestine" to refer to this region.Around 1000 BC, Jewish people established the Kingdom of Israel in Canaan.
The second king of the kingdom, King David (1010 BC-970 BC), is also reported to have led the capture of Jebus (Jerusalem).
As with the construction of the palace and the temple of Yahweh, Judaism became the state religion.
The scope of the Jewish "Promised Land" also changed due to King David's expansion.
According to the Bible, the promised land for God's chosen people was roughly the territory that lay between the Dead Sea and the Mediterranean, read a New York Times article.
During King David's reign, his kingdom extended from deep within the Sinai Peninsula to the Euphrates River, including large areas of present-day Lebanon, Syria, Jordan, and Egypt.
This is reflected in the description of the Promised Land in the Five Books of Moses, according to publicly available materials.According to media reports, records show that in around 931BC, the kingdoms of Israel and Judah (the origin of the term "Jewish") existed in tandem.
Around the same time, the Philistines occupied the southern coastal plain of Israel.
In around 722 BC, the Kingdom of Israel was conquered by the Neo-Assyrian Empire, and as an ancient geographical term, "Israel" ceased to exist.
Over a century and a half later, the Kingdom of Judah was also overthrown, and many of its inhabitants were exiled to Babylon.
Subsequently, this land was conquered by ancient Greece and the Roman Empire.
In 4 BC, 6 AD, 66 AD, and 132 AD, the local Jewish population staged multiple uprisings against Roman occupation, but they were brutally suppressed.
From 70 AD to 132 AD, most Jews were forced to leave Canaan, marking the end of the Jewish people's settlement in the region.
In 135 AD, after suppressing the uprising, the Roman Empire abolished the province of Judea and merged it with the province of Syria to eliminate memories associated with the Jewish people.In the year 637 AD, the Arabs defeated the Eastern Roman Empire army and Palestine was incorporated into the Arab Empire.
During the Umayyad dynasty (661 AD to 750 AD), Jerusalem, which was once a holy site for Judaism and Christianity, became one of the three major holy sites of Islam, along with Mecca and Medina.
Present-day Jerusalem, with an area of only 126 square kilometers, is home to the Western Wall and the Temple Mount for Jews, the Dome of the Rock and the Al-Aqsa Mosque for Muslims, and the Church of the Holy Sepulchre and the Via Dolorosa for Christians.According to an article published on the news website The Conversation, "Israel" and "Palestine" are two names for one land.
"Israel" first appears near the end of the 13th century BC within the Egyptian Merneptah Stele, referring apparently to a people (rather than a place) inhabiting what was then "Canaan," read the article.
"Palestina took its name from the coastal territory of the ancient Philistines, enemies of the Israelites (ancestors of the Jews).
Subsequent to the Islamic conquest of the Middle East in the seventh century, Arab peoples began to settle in the former 'Palestina.'
Apart from about 90 years of Crusader domination, the land fell under Muslim control for just under 1,200 years.
Although Jewish habitation never ceased, the population was overwhelmingly Arab," said the article.Genesis of ZionismPalestine became a part of the Ottoman Empire in the 16th century.
After World War I, the defeated Ottoman Empire, which was allied with Germany, reluctantly handed over the region, including Palestine, to British mandate rule.
In the late 19th century, the Zionist movement, particularly among European Jews who feared extinction, began to emigrate in large numbers to the Palestinian-inhabited areas.Zionism, also known as Jewish nationalism, takes its name from Mount Zion, a small hill outside the Old City of Jerusalem, symbolizing the ancestral homeland of Israel.
Despite the industrial revolution and modernization, anti-Semitism and discrimination against Jews in Europe persisted.
Increasingly, secular European Jews supported the idea of returning to their own homeland and establishing a Jewish state, even though a large number of Jews at the time did not endorse the idea of national restoration.
Followers of Zionism believed that only by establishing a purely Jewish state could the fate of oppression and exile that Jews had endured for nearly two millennia be resolved.
However, it cannot be ignored that their desired destination, Palestine, was not an "uninhabited land," and the idea of a purely Jewish state inevitably clashed with the basic rights of the indigenous Arab population.
The founders of Zionism attempted to reach an agreement with the Ottoman Empire, which would overrule the existence of Palestine at the time, but were unsuccessful.
As a result, they focused their efforts on gaining support from Western powers.World War I brought a significant turning point to the once stagnant Zionist movement.
Chemist Chaim Weizmann, who had made important contributions to the British army during the war, became the leader of the Zionist movement.
He united with Jewish elites such as the Rothschilds and gained the support of the British government.However, although the Ottoman Empire was defeated in the war and the UK began its mandatory colonial rule in Palestine, the British did not promptly fulfill their promise to the Jewish people.
Instead, they tightened restrictions on Jewish immigration.At the same time, Palestine witnessed a wave of immigration of Jewish people facing persecution in Eastern Europe.
Prompted by the wave of immigration, the leaders of the Zionist movement considered finding a piece of land in Argentina to be their homeland, and the British government also proposed allocating land from its colony, Uganda for a Jewish settlement.
However, due to the special religious and historical significance of Palestine, especially Jerusalem, to the Jewish people, the Zionist movement ultimately insisted that returning to Palestine was the only truly satisfactory outcome for the establishment of a homeland.Far from this decision bringing a satisfactory outcome, it marked the beginning of suffering.
Starting from the late 1920s, Arab nationalists, began to push back against the Zionist movement.
They organized armed attacks on Jewish settlements and pressured the British to completely close Jewish immigration channels.
As the strategic importance of oil increased, the British turned against Jewish people and supported the Arabs, causing further chaos.The rise of the Nazi regime in Germany and the outbreak of World War II accelerated the "return" of Jews to Palestine.
The brutal fact that 6 million Jews perished in the German Nazi-mandated holocaust during the war quickly changed the mainstream opinion in Europe and America, leading to support for the establishment of Israel.
Exhausted and depleted from the war, the UK had no choice but to adjudicate the Palestine issue to the United Nations.
In November 1947, UN Resolution 181 on the partition of Palestine was passed, marking the official establishment of an Arab state and a Jewish state in the region.
This resolution was met with jubilation by the Jewish people, but the allocation of about 55 percent of the land to Israel and the subsequent opposition from Palestinians and other Arab countries sparked controversy.Hope for peaceful coexistenceOn the second day after Israel declared its independence, the Arab-Israeli War of 1948 broke out.
By the end of the war in 1949, Palestinians had lost nearly four-fifths of the territory allocated to them by the United Nations, and over 750,000 people were displaced from their homes.
The core issues of territory, refugees, the status of Jerusalem, and Jewish settlements have created significant disagreements between Israelis and Palestinians, becoming obstacles to peace talks.Today, with the exception of very few countries, the rights and political status of the Jewish people are guaranteed.
Against this backdrop, how to promote progress within Israel along the only viable and nonviolent path, and save both Palestinians and Israelis from "imminent catastrophe", are questions that many historians contemplate.
Some of them believe that the prolonged turmoil is a result of negligence toward the interests of the Palestinian population during the nation-building process.
They argue that Zionism, as an ideological mission for the establishment of Israel, should not supersede the rights of other minority groups in any subsequent system.Some observers believe that throughout history, the Jewish people have endured great suffering but have also achieved great accomplishments, becoming a driving force in the progress of global civilization.
The Palestinian people, on the other hand, have inherited the tragic fate of the Jewish people, who have been without a country, wandering for nearly 2,000 years.
Today, Hamas represents the extreme aspirations of the Palestinian people to establish a state on equal footing with Israel.
As long as this goal is not achieved, there will be people who will follow the path of Hamas.
As China has consistently maintained, the solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict lies in the "two-state solution," which means establishing an independent Palestinian state.
Only through this can peaceful coexistence between Palestine and Israel be achieved, and harmony between the Arab and Jewish nations be realized.

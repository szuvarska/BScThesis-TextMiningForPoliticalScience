China will hold high-level conferences on the Global Security Initiative (GSI) at an appropriate time, work with all parties for dialogue and exchanges on global security issues in various forms, act on the vision of common, comprehensive, and sustainable security, and build more international consensus on jointly tackling challenges and safeguarding common security, China's Assistant Foreign Minister Nong Rong said in a speech at the 10th Beijing Xiangshan Forum on Tuesday.Nong delivered a speech before the third plenary session of the 10th Beijing Xiangshan Forum, elaborating on the support and appreciation toward the GSI by many countries, international and regional organizations, as the initiative was written into a large number of bilateral and multilateral exchange and cooperation documents between China and other countries and international organizations.Nong stated that to further deepen, solidify, stabilize, and expand the GSI, and to grow international consensus on maintaining common security, China will continue to work with all parties for dialogue and exchanges on global security issues in various forms, "opposing the formation of small circles based on ideology and confrontation."
In addition, Nong also stated that China will keep exploring peaceful solutions to hotspot issue.
China will keep to the general direction of promoting talks for peace and encourage countries to enhance mutual security confidence, manage differences and defuse tensions through candid dialogue and communication, he noted.Regarding the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, China will continue to actively promote an immediate ceasefire to prevent a humanitarian disaster and push for a comprehensive and just solution to the issue based on a two-state solution.
In addressing the Ukrainian crisis, China will be committed to the right direction of promoting peace talks, calling on all parties to work for cessation of hostilities and de-escalation and create conditions for restarting talks, and strive persistently for peace.Nong also outlined China's active mediation diplomacy and unremitting efforts to promote political solutions to hotspot issues.
China has released its position on the political resolution of the Ukrainian crisis and the Afghanistan issue, firmly standing on the side of peace.
China has successfully mediated the reconciliation between Saudi Arabia and Iran, setting an example for regional countries to resolve conflicts and differences through dialogue and consultation, and achieve good neighborliness and friendship.
Since the outbreak of the new conflict between Israel and Palestine, China has actively communicated and coordinated with relevant parties, dispatched special envoys to visit regional countries, and provided humanitarian assistance to Palestine in a timely manner, promoting the de-escalation of the situation, preventing the escalation of hostilities, and avoiding a humanitarian disaster, thus creating conditions for a political solution, Nong stressed.

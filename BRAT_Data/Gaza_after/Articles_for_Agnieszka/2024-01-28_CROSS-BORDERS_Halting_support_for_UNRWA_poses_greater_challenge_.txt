Experts said on Sunday that the humanitarian issues such as refugee relief brought about by the Israeli-Palestinian conflict are anticipated to become even more complex, posing a greater challenge to the authority of the United Nations (UN).At least eight countries have paused future funding to the UNRWA in the Near East amid an investigation into allegations that some workers of the UN agency participated in the October 7 attack on Israel in 2023.A senior Palestinian official on Saturday urged countries that have announced the suspension of support for UNRWA to reconsider their decisions to avoid political and humanitarian risks, according to the Xinhua News Agency.
On Saturday, UNRWA Commissioner-General Philippe Lazzarini said the funding pause from countries that accounts for much of its budget will serve to exacerbate the region's humanitarian crisis, fueled by the cutting-off of fuel and supplies.
"It is shocking to see a suspension of funds to the Agency in reaction to allegations against a small group of staff, especially given the immediate action that UNRWA took by terminating their contracts and asking for a transparent independent investigation," Lazzarini said in a statement.Chinese experts said that since the outbreak of the latest Israeli-Palestinian conflict, UNRWA operations have encountered significant difficulties.
Its difficulties in terms of funding, security and personnel will further exacerbate the humanitarian crisis in Gaza and the living difficulties in the West Bank, Liu Zhongmin, a professor at the Middle East Studies Institute of Shanghai International Studies University, told the Global Times on Sunday.Additionally, humanitarian issues such as refugee relief are anticipated to become even more complex, posing a greater challenge to the authority of the UN, Liu said.The UNRWA, established in 1949 as a subsidiary organ of the UN General Assembly, serves to support the relief and human development of Palestinian refugees and is entrusted with the mission of providing humanitarian assistance and protection to registered Palestinian refugees in the agency's operational areas until a just and lasting solution to their plight is achieved.UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has pledged to conduct an "urgent and comprehensive independent review of UNRWA" in the aftermath of Israel's allegations.At least 26,422 Palestinians have been killed and 65,087 injured in Israeli strikes on Gaza since October 7, 2023, Reuters reported, citing the Gaza health ministry in a statement on Sunday.

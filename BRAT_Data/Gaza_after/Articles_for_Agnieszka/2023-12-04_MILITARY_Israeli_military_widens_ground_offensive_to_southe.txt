The Israeli military confirmed Sunday that it has expanded its ground offensive against Hamas militants in Southern Gaza, an area previously considered a "safe zone," sparking deep concern across the international community that nowhere in the Gaza Strip is safe for Palestinians anymore.
Chinese observers on Monday said that though trust has been impaired, common ground for a new cease-fire between the conflicting sides still exists, and the conflict itself has increasingly shifted from being primarily a military one to a complex game involving military, politics, diplomacy, and public opinion struggles.
"We fought strongly and thoroughly in the northern Gaza Strip, and we are also doing it now in the southern Gaza Strip," Herzi Halevi, the chief of the General Staff of Israel Defense Forces (IDF), said during a tour at Israel's Gaza Division outside the besieged enclave, according to a statement released by the military, Xinhua News Agency reported on Monday.
At least 700 Palestinians have been killed in the past 24 hours - one of the highest daily death tolls since the war began on October 7, per the Al Jazeera coverage on Sunday.China is deeply concerned over the resumed fighting in Gaza, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said on Monday, noting that under the current situation, the goal of ending the hostilities should not change and the principle of protecting civilians should not be violated.
"Facts prove once again that the use of force will never bring lasting peace.
Heavier civilian casualties will only create more hatred and bring the next conflict nearer," the spokesperson said.
China strongly calls on relevant sides to exercise restraint, the international community, especially countries with influence on the Palestinian-Israeli issue, to earnestly play a responsible role, implement the Security Council's Resolution 2712 and the resolution adopted by the UN General Assembly at its emergency session, promote a comprehensive and lasting ceasefire, protect civilians, ease the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, resume talks for peace as soon as possible and work relentlessly for the peaceful co-existence between Palestine and Israel and lasting peace in the Middle East, Wang said.
The Israeli army resumed its offensive against Hamas in the Gaza Strip early Friday after a week-long humanitarian cease-fire came to an end.
No aid entered the enclave via the Rafah crossing with Egypt on Friday, and delivery on Saturday was restricted, further impacting humanitarian operations to support millions amid a scarcity of food, water, fuel and other basic essentials, according to the United Nation (UN) official website.The resumption of hostilities in Gaza and its terrifying impact on civilians underscore the need for the violence to end and a long-term political solution between Palestinians and Israelis to be found, Volker Turk, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights said on Sunday.
"Silence the guns and return to dialogue - the suffering inflicted on civilians is too much to bear.
More violence is not the answer.
It will bring neither peace nor security," he said in a statement, voicing deep concern that negotiations towards a continuation of last week's pause had reportedly stalled.The basic factors that would hopefully push for the next round of a cease-fire still exist, although the foundation of trust [between Israel and Palestine] has been impaired, Zhu Yongbiao, executive director of the Research Center for the Belt and Road at Lanzhou University, told the Global Times on Monday.According to Zhu, such basic factors include intensified international pressure from the US - Israel's main ally - the UN and its member countries such as China, the Arab world and France.
Also, both Israel and Hamas need to strive for another truce, so as to respond to international concerns, and also replenish their combat readiness, Zhu pointed out.
The Israel-Palestine conflict has increasingly shifted from being primarily a military one to a complex game involving military, politics, diplomacy, and public opinion, Liu Zhongmin, a professor at the Middle East Studies Institute of Shanghai International Studies University, told the Global Times on Monday.
Yemen's Houthi rebel group on Sunday claimed responsibility for attacking two "Israeli ships" off Yemen's Red Sea coast near the strategic Bab el-Mandeb Strait earlier in the day, with its spokesperson warning that Houthi forces would continue hampering Israeli ships from sailing in the Red Sea and the Arabian Sea until Israeli military aggression against the Gaza Strip ceases.The Pentagon claimed that a US Navy warship also came under attack in the Red Sea as Houthis from Yemen intensified attacks.

The leaders of China and the US will have an in-depth talk on the strategic, overall, and directional issues concerning China-US relations, as well as major issues related to world peace and development, said the Chinese Foreign Ministry on Monday over the closely watched upcoming interaction, emphasizing that China will always handle the bilateral relations based on mutual respect, peaceful coexistence, and win-win cooperation.Great power competition is not the solution to the challenges faced by the US and the world and China opposes defining China-US relations as competition, said Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning.
Mao respectively responded to the so-called concerns which an anonymous White House official said would be raised over the Taiwan question, the South China Sea and the Palestine-Israel conflict during the top leaders' meeting.
"Each US government has made clear commitments on the Taiwan question throughout its history.
During the Bali Summit, the US stated that it does not support Taiwan independence.
The US should faithfully adhere to the One-China Principle and take concrete actions against Taiwan independence," said Mao as the official said the US doesn't support "Taiwan independence" and wants no change in the status quo.It is the Democratic Progressive Party and the external forces supporting its pursuit of "Taiwan independence" who are changing the status quo, said Mao.Mao urged the US to stop making excuses and not to interfere in territorial and maritime disputes between China and other countries, and to stop using these issues to contain or suppress China.
The remarks were made in response to announcement that the US will emphasize its security commitment to the Philippines over the South China Sea issue during the meeting.
Over the Palestine-Israel conflict, Mao said the Chinese side always stands on the side of fairness and justice, maintains close communication with relevant parties, and is committed to de-escalating the situation and protecting civilians.

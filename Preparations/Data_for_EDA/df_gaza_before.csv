 The first Saudi ambassador to Palestine Naif bin Bandar Al-Sudairi arrived in the West Bank on Tuesday, the official Palestinian news agency WAFA reported.Leading an official delegation, Al-Sudairi, the non-resident ambassador to Palestine and non-resident consul general in Jerusalem, presented his credentials to Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas at the presidency headquarters in Ramallah, it said.Al-Sudairi's arrival comes amid Israel's efforts to normalize relations with Saudi Arabia.During their meeting, Abbas welcomed Al-Sudairi and said his visit to Palestine and his appointment as Saudi ambassador to the State of Palestine would contribute to ""strengthening the strong fraternal relations that bind the two countries and the two brotherly peoples.""The Saudi ambassador said he hoped that his visit would be ""a successful beginning for strengthening relations in all fields,"" stressing his country's firm and supportive positions for the Palestinian people and their just cause.Earlier in the day, Al-Sudairi told reporters in a statement that ""the Arab Peace Initiative is the basic point in any upcoming agreement,"" after being asked about the fate of the initiative in the event of reaching a normalization deal between Saudi Arabia and Israel.The Arab Peace Initiative was launched in 2002 after it was drafted by Saudi Arabia and adopted by the Arab League.The initiative calls for an end to the conflict between Israel and Palestine and the normalization of relations between Israel and Arab states, in exchange for an Israeli withdrawal from the areas it gained since 1967 and proper settlement to the issue of Palestinian refugees.The Palestinians demanded the establishment of an independent state alongside Israel in all of the Palestinian territories occupied by Israel in 1967, including the entire West Bank and the Gaza Strip, with East Jerusalem as its capital.The Saudi ambassador also confirmed that his country intends to open a consulate in East Jerusalem soon.",PHOTO,WORLD,"Saudi ambassador to Palestine Naif bin Bandar Al-Sudairi (Front) arrives at the Palestinian foreign ministry headquarters in the West Bank city of Ramallah, on Sept. 26, 2023.(Photo: Xinhua)",Author details not found,Author details not found,12,313,<FreqDist with 15 samples and 181 outcomes>
China releases a white paper on its proposals and actions on building a global community of shared future,GT staff reporters,2023-09-26," The Chinese government released a white paper on Tuesday to introduce the theoretical base, practice and development of a global community of shared future, as by presenting China's vision of the course of human development, it counters the hegemonic thinking of certain countries that seek supremacy. The white paper, titled ""A Global Community of Shared Future: China's Proposals and Actions,"" introduced the background for China to raise the concept of a global community of shared future as the world is undergoing changes on a scale unseen in a century with various problems posing unprecedented challenges for human society. The zero-sum game is doomed to fail, the white paper said. But certain countries still cling to this mindset, blindly pursuing absolute security and monopolistic advantages, which will do nothing for their development in the long run but create a major threat to the world. It is increasingly obvious that the obsession with superior strength, and the zero-sum mentality are in conflict with the needs of our times, the white paper said, pointing out that the new era calls for new ideas. To build a global community of shared future is to pursue openness, inclusiveness, mutual benefit, equity and justice, the white paper said. The goal is not to replace one system or civilization with another. Instead, it is about countries with different social systems, ideologies, histories, shared rights, and shared responsibilities in global affairs. The vision of a global community of shared future stands on the right side of history and on the side of human progress. It introduces a new approach for international relations, provides new ideas for global governance, opens up new prospects for international exchanges and draws a new blueprint for a better world, according to the white paper. Such important vision transcends outdated mindsets such as zero-sum game, power politics, and Cold War confrontations. It has become the overall goal of China's major-country diplomacy in the new era, and a great banner that leads the trend of the times and the direction of human progress. The concept of a global community of shared future has deep roots in China's profound cultural heritage and its unique experience of modernization. It carries forward the diplomatic traditions of China and draws on the outstanding achievements of all other civilizations, the white paper said. It also manifests China's time-honored historical traditions, distinct characteristics of the times, and a wealth of humanistic values.  The white paper also pointed out the direction and plan to build a global community of shared future including pressing ahead with a new type of economic globalization in which countries need to pursue a policy of openness and explicitly oppose protectionism, the erection of fences and barriers, unilateral sanctions, and maximum-pressure tactics, so as to connect economies and jointly build an open world economy. Some countries are seeking to decouple from China, enclosing themselves in ""small yards, high fences,"" which will ultimately only backfire, the white paper said. Also, some people overstate the need to ""reduce dependence"" and ""de-risk,"" which is essentially creating new risks. The direction and the plan also include following a peaceful development plan, fostering a new type of international relations, practicing true multilateralism and promoting the common values of humanity. Over the past decade, China has contributed its strength to building a global community of shared future with firm conviction and solid actions. For instance, by July 2023, more than three-quarters of countries in the world and over 30 international organizations had signed agreements on Belt and Road cooperation with China. The BRI originated in China but the opportunities and achievements it creates belong to the whole world. It's an initiative for economic cooperation, not for geopolitical or military alliances, and it's open and inclusive process that neither targets nor excludes any party, the white paper said. Among those BRI projects, for example, the China-Laos Railway began operation on December 3, 2021, with 167 tunnels and 301 bridges built in 11 years along its total length of 1,035 kilometers. The railway construction created more than 110,000 local jobs, and helped build about 2,000 kilometers of roads and canals for villages along the railway, benefiting local people. Besides the BRI, the Global Development Initiative, the Global Security Initiative and Global Civilization Initiative have evolved into a crucial cornerstone for building a global community of shared future, offering China's solutions to major challenges pertaining to peace and development for humanity. Facing constant flare-ups of hotspot issues, China has been committed to fulfilling its role as a responsible major country, pushing for the resolution of international and regional flashpoints, such as the Korean Peninsula, Palestine, the Iranian nuclear issue, Syria and Afghanistan, the white paper said. On the Ukraine issue, China has actively promoted talks for peace, put forth four points, four things that the international community should do together and three observations, and released China's position on the political settlement of the Ukraine crisis and has dispatched the special representative of the Chinese government on Eurasian affairs to engage in extensive interactions and exchanges with stakeholders on the political settlement of the Ukraine crisis. Also, through the mediation of China, Saudi Arabia and Iran achieve historic reconciliation earlier this year, setting a fine example for countries in the region to resolve disputes and differences and achieve good neighborly relations through dialogue and consultation, and catalyzing a wave of reconciliation in the Middle East. China has also proposed a range of regional and bilateral initiatives on building communities of shared future and working with stakeholders to build consensus and expand cooperation, there by playing a constructive role in promoting regional peace and development. It also boosts international cooperation in fields including fighting the COVID-19 pandemic, addressing disorder in cyberspace governance and dealing with the global climate challenge. Over the past decade, the vision of a global community of shared future has gained broader support. More countries and people have come to the understanding that this vision serves the common interests of humanity, represents popular calls for peace, justice and progress, and can create the greatest synergy among all nations for building a better world, the white paper said.",CHINA,POLITICS,Photo: Li Xuanmin/GT,Author details not found,Author details not found,33,1000,<FreqDist with 17 samples and 603 outcomes>

F-35: Closer Look at Colossally Costly Jet That Just Can’t Seem to Stay Airborne,Sputnik,2023-09-21,"A US Marine Corps F-35B went down over South Carolina on Sunday after its pilot ejected mid-flight for reasons unknown. Why do F-35s seem so crash-prone? What’s wrong with them? And what role does the waste and fraud in the US military-industrial complex play in creating such a Frankenstein’s monster of an aircraft? Sputnik explores.Debris from the F-35B that went missing over South Carolina on September 17 was found in Williamsburg County, South Carolina, about two hours northeast of Joint Base Charleston on Monday following more than a day of frantic searching by the military. An as yet unspecified “mishap” was blamed for the accident. The pilot escaped unscathed.“The mishap is currently under investigation, and we are unable to provide additional details to preserve the integrity of the investigative process,” the Marine Corps said in a statement Monday. The Marines ordered a two-day global pause in all aerial operations, with the errant F-35B becoming the third major aviation-related accident suffered by the military branch in less than two months.Air units will be discussing “fundamentals of safe flight operations, ground safety, maintenance and flight procedures, and maintaining combat readiness,” the Marine Corps said.How Many F-35s Have Been Lost?Since it started being introduced into service with the Marines (2015), the US Air Force (2016), and the US Navy (2019) and began to be exported to foreign clients (starting with Israel in 2018), the F-35 has gained an unenviable reputation of being a costly, buggy, and crash-prone jet, with the F-35B that went down over South Carolina last week being at least the 11th Lightning II lost since 2018.On September 28, 2018, a US Marine Corps F-35B crashed during a flight near Marine Corps Air Station Beaufort in South Carolina, with a faulty fuel tube blamed for the incident. The pilot emerged unscathed.On April 9, 2019, a Japanese Self- Defense Force F-35A went down off Honshu, Japan. The pilot was killed after losing his bearings and suffering “special disorientation” mid-flight over the ocean.On May 19, 2020, a US Air Force F-35A from the 58th Fighter Squadron crashed while performing a landing at Eglin Air Force Base in western Florida. Pilot error (trying to land at excessive speed) and a mechanical defect related to a flight control glitch that left the plane’s tail unresponsive were blamed. The pilot survived.On September 29, 2020, a US Marine Corps F-35B was lost over Imperial County, California after colliding with a KC-130 tanker during midflight refueling. The tanker crew managed to bring their aircraft down for a hard landing. The F-35 pilot ejected successfully.On November 17, 2021, a British Royal Air Force F-35B plunged into the Mediterranean Sea after its pilot ejected during routine operations. That crash was ultimately blamed on a protective cover getting wedged into the plane’s engine intake.On January 4, 2022, a South Korean Air Force F-35A suffering from issues with its onboard avionics carried out an emergency belly landing. Investigators blamed a bird striking the warplane’s landing gear mid-flight. The pilot emerged unharmed.On January 24, 2022, a US Navy F-35C plunged into the South China Sea after making a hard landing on the USS Carl Vinson super carrier. The pilot and six sailors on the deck of the aircraft carrier were injured. A Navy investigation attributed the incident to pilot error.On October 19, 2022, another F-35, this one from the US Air Force, crashed at Hill Air Force Base in Utah during a training mission. The pilot ejected safely. It was later determined that turbulent air somehow confused the jet’s onboard avionics to the point where the aircraft became uncontrollable.On December 1, 2022, a Marine Corps F-35B collapsed on a military base in Japan after suffering a landing gear failure during training. No one was injured.Finally, on December 15, 2022, a US Navy F-35B crashed while attempting to perform a vertical landing at Naval Air Station Joint Reserve Base Fort Worth in Texas during testing of the jet’s systems. A “harmonic resonance” issue related to the jet’s Pratt & Whitney F135 engine was blamed, with the Pentagon halting further F-35 deliveries by Lockheed until an investigation was concluded.What’s Wrong With the F-35?Nearly 17 years after the F-35’s first flight, and eight years after its adoption into service, the F-35 continues to maintain a troublingly long list of technical bugs affecting both hardware and software. The aircraft, which has an astronomical total estimated purchase and sustainment price tag of over $1.7 trillion, and a per-plane cost of $70-$90 million, has faced years of harsh criticism from US officials, including former President Donald Trump at one point, who said the jet’s costs had spiraled “out of control.”At its heart, the F-35 is the product of an idea that metastasized in the Pentagon after the end of the Cold War, envisioning an all-in-one fighter platform which could be used by every branch of the military, equipped with vertical take-off and landing capability, and carry out a broad array of missions using a variety of onboard weapons. The do-it-all jet was supposed to replace nearly all of America’s fourth-gen fighter, strike, and ground attack aircraft, including the F-16 Falcon, the F/A-18 Hornet and Super Hornet, the AV-8B Harrier II, and others.The jet features just a single onboard engine – the aforementioned Pratt & Whitney F135, with engine-related troubles not only regularly referred to by watchdogs as a “leading driver” of the F-35’s problems remaining “mission capable,” but also making its operation over enemy territory or over the sea risky, since if something goes wrong, the plane doesn’t have a backup engine to limp home with.Throughout its production cycle, the F-35 Lightning II has suffered a dizzying and seemingly endless list of technical problems, from neck-snapping ejection seats to problems, ironically, while operating in stormy weather.In its 2023 report, the congressional Government Accountability Office revealed that the F-35 program “continues to experience schedule delays, cost growth, and late deliveries,” with procurement costs jumping by $13.4 billion since 2019, and modernization behind schedule and over budget.“As of January 2023, of the 821 open deficiencies, the program office characterized five of these as category 1 [i.e. critical issues which could jeopardize flight safety and security], and 816 as category 2, [i.e. those which could impede or constrain mission success].”In all, between December 2006 and 2023, the GAO has reported a whopping 277 category 1 and 2,467 category 2 deficiencies with the aircraft, among them serious issues like cabin over-pressurization, problems with the jets’ night vision systems, software bugs, radar issues, corrosion, ejection seats which could snap pilots’ necks, etc.Is a Culture of Largess to Blame?Sunday’s accident in South Carolina is the latest piece of F-35-related bad news for Lockheed Martin. In June, it was reported that the Pentagon had halted the delivery of any additional upgraded F-35s until major issues related to new Technology Refresh 3 (TR-3) hardware and weapons-related software were resolved. DoD F-35 program director Mike Schmidt told Congress in March that the risk assessment related to the TR-3 hardware upgrade wouldn’t be finished until April 2024.Despite the delays and array of technical problems, the weapons giant has continued to rack up generous contracts related to F-35 procurement and production. For example, in July, the US Navy ordered a $490 million package of equipment from Lockheed “to procure various material mod kits, special test/tooling equipment, as well as…product engineering” for already delivered, but defective planes. In August, Lockheed received another $606 million “fixed-price incentive (firm-target) undefinitized” contract “for long lead time materials, parts, components, and efforts to support of maintaining on-time production and delivery of 173 Lot 19 F-35 Joint Strike Fighter aircraft for Foreign Military Sales (FMS) customers and non-US Department of Defense (DOD) participants.”The terms of the contracts seem to be the culprit behind the F-35’s soaring costs (and Lockheed’s soaring profits, despite delivery of defective products), with so-called “cost-plus” and “undefinitized” contracts effectively making any overruns the buyer’s problem – i.e. that of US taxpayers, and of citizens of any country unfortunate enough to pen contracts for the planes from Lockheed.What About America’s Competitors?The worst part about the F-35’s troublesome history seems to be that the F-35 has already become ""obsolete"" in the sense that many of the US and NATO’s competitors have obtained the ability to defeat them, with Russia and China gaining capabilities to track and target the jets going back to the mid-to-late 2010s. In April, Iran announced that its engineers had created advanced radar technologies to not only detect F-35s, but identify the radar signature of individual F-35 planes, enabling the Islamic Republic to plan defensive operations accordingly.",WORLD,AMERICAS,Picture description not found,Author details not found,Author details not found,60,1305,<FreqDist with 18 samples and 775 outcomes>
Toxic explosion in Nebraska shows US unable to take issues affecting public security seriously: experts,Xu Yelu,2023-09-15,"Barely two months after an explosion in Louisiana, a train carrying toxic perchloric acid has exploded in a Nebraska rail yard on Thursday, prompting evacuation orders to be issued, as huge plumes are seen engulfing the city. Experts said the incident shows the US has been unable to take seriously and overcome major issues affecting public safety and the environment and ecology in the country.The incident happened on Union Pacific Railroad tracks in the city of North Platte. North Platte Volunteer Fire Department announced that they would order those living in the area to evacuate due to the toxic smoke from the railroad, according to media reports.In a post on social media platforms, it said that ""Emergency evacuation for the area between splinter and front North of railroad track due fire at the railroad involving heavy toxic smoke.""In a statement to DailyMail.com, Union Pacific Railroad said that an explosion occurred inside a container which resulted in several railcars catching fire. The railcar did not derail, the company said, and had been in the yard for several hours.Union Pacific said that one of the containers contained a hazardous chemical called perchloric acid, according to Daily Mail.Perchloric is a hazardous material used in food, drugs and biocidal products, as well as explosives, according to the report.Two months ago, a fire at a Louisiana chemical plant triggered explosions that shook homes several miles away and sent flames and smoke billowing into the air in mid-July, prompting emergency officials to urge a few hundred nearby residents to shelter indoors for several hours and to turn off their air conditioners, the Associated Press reported.Antiquated infrastructure and the outdated transportation were one factor. Another was a flawed system of governance in the US transport industry, experts noted. There is no doubt that the US has serious loopholes in the transportation management of hazardous substances, and the relevant error correction mechanism is in fact not effective, which means that this kind of thing will occur in the future, Li Haidong, a professor at the China Foreign Affairs University, told the Global Times on Friday.This shows that the US has been unable to take seriously and overcome serious and major issues affecting public safety and the environment and ecology in the country, Li said. ""It must be said that this is a great irony to the self-proclaimed internal governance of the most advanced country in the world.""Analysts said that the frequent occurrence of similar incidents shows that the error correction mechanism in the US has failed. Apart from this, racism and the proliferation of guns are also clear examples of the failure of error correction mechanisms, experts noted.",WORLD,AMERICAS,"A resident of East Palestine in the state of Ohio, US, angrily points during a town hall meeting held by the US

Greek scholar believes in ‘endless possibilities and vast land’ between China-Greece exchanges,Xu Liuliu,2023-09-14,"Chongqing, Sichuan, Shandong… Stelios Virvidakis expectantly plans his next China tour before a visit by the Global Times at his office in Athens, Greece. The University of Athens professor has grown far busier recently since he and four other Greek scholars launched the Center of Chinese and Greek Ancient Civilizations in February. Over the summer, the center has received two scholars from China who have given lectures on the history of China, and other visiting guests from places like Israel, who offered their views on Chinese medicine and its history, and a lecturer from France with insights in Chinese mathematics and how scholars in ancient China studied the living science.""Students found them to be very interesting and greatly appreciated the lectures,"" Virvidakis told the Global Times. ""Greece and China share so many similarities. So in my opinion, the horizon for our cooperation and exchanges is vast. There are endless possibilities which have not been explored.""Mutual learning Chinese President Xi Jinping replied to a letter from Virvidakis and four other Greek scholars earlier in 2023, extending congratulations over the founding of the Center of Chinese and Greek Ancient Civilizations.Hailing the long history of the Chinese civilization and profound influence of the ancient Greek civilization, Xi said in the letter that more than 2,000 years ago, the two civilizations shone brightly on the two ends of the Eurasian continent, jointly making a fundamental contribution to the evolution of human civilization.Greece's golden era produced many of its great philosophers and literary giants. The era coincided with a period in China in which ""a hundred schools of thought contended with each other"" and flourished together.As early as the 4th century BC, China was known to the Greeks by a beautiful name: Sērikḗ. In the 16th century, Euclid's Elements was introduced into China, paving the way for scientific exchanges between China and the West. The story of Prometheus narrated by Aeschylus was an inspiration to many Chinese revolutionaries. The Republic by Plato and Politics by Aristotle are also among the Greek classics known to have long made a name for themselves in China.In the eyes of Virvidakis, Chinese civilization has always been a culture that attracts people though the language is difficult. However, Chinese art, Chinese painting, Chinese poetry, especially love poems, even detective stories about China, are incredibly fascinating. Chinese director Zhang Yimou, and movies like Farewell My Concubine and Raise the Red Lantern starring Gong Li, are also very popular. Greek archaeologists who are interested in Chinese archeology want to know how China explores the past.In other art forms, the mythology and theater, ""we have tragedy, which is our own tradition. You have Chinese opera with music."" Actors and artists always want to study similarities and look at the differences, which is also the commitment of the center to promoting exchanges and mutual learning between the two civilizations and promoting the development of civilizations in various countries. China also has this appeal because people in the West think ""it's very different, it's exotic, something strange, but then they realize that it's beautiful for them."" So ""they find a lot of aspects that they have not thought about before in order to understand.""

Tiantan, a UNESCO World Heritage Site built in 1420, in Beijing Photo: VCGPhilosophy, a way of life There is a feeling among some people in the West that the Chinese system is different in some ways, said the professor. For instance,the European and American systems place great emphasis on individual rights, but China takes a more holistic approach in which ""harmony, social harmony is more important in sovereign.""""We are not exactly the same and there are also differences. But I don't believe in the so-called clash of civilizations theory that the clash is very deep and we can't live together with our differences,"" he told the Global Times. ""In fact we can live together and have peaceful exchanges. As I said, I don't think there is any danger of Greece threatening China or China occupying Greece.""In February, Virvidakis held a lecture at the center's launching ceremony, titled Philosophy is a Way of Life. Philosophy is not just theory, he said, noting that in ancient Greece and China it didn't mean just making theories about the universe, nature, god, or much of the unknown world. ""It told you how to 'organize' your life to feel happy and achieve harmony with others."" Western philosophy cannot be understood just by itself as there are also Chinese and Indian schools of philosophy among others. ""It is easier to see some similarities in ideas between Confucius and Socrates or Confucius and Aristotle,"" said Virvidakis, explaining why he is so fond of Chinese philosophy, especially Confucius thought. A simple question about what is a good life has a variety of answers in different philosophical theories.  But studying philosophy is practical and a way of life. Modern people don't just derive happiness from materialism. They need art and other emotionally stirring elements in life.

"China issues proposal on reform, devt of global governance",Yang Sheng,2023-09-13,"The Chinese Foreign Ministry on Wednesday issued the Proposal of the People's Republic of China on the Reform and Development of Global Governance, with Chinese analysts saying this comprehensive and far-sighted document reflects China's ideas and stances over almost all hotspot issues worldwide, and that it is crucial for the building of a community with a shared future for mankind.The year 2023 marks the 10th anniversary of the proposal of the idea of a ""community with a shared future for mankind"" by Chinese President Xi Jinping. Over the past decade, this concept has grown from an idea to action, and from a vision to reality, said the proposal, adding that China calls on the international community to act on true multilateralism, uphold the international system with the United Nations (UN) at its core, support the UN in playing a central role in international affairs, and further develop and improve the global governance system.Detailing the proposal at a regular press briefing on Wednesday, Mao Ning, a spokesperson for the Chinese Foreign Ministry, said the international community expects the UN to play an active role in international affairs and continuously reform and improve the global governance system.The proposal comprehensively elaborates China's stance and propositions on key areas of global governance such as peace, security, development, human rights and society, as well as on institutional reform, she said.Experts held that in the document, China released its latest stances and proposals about the Ukraine crisis, the nuclear issues of Iran and the Korean Peninsula, the Afghanistan issue, the Palestine-Israel conflict, as well as the issues of Syria, Sudan, Libya and Yemen. These stances are different from the US and some of its Western allies, but much closer and similar to those of developing countries. This proves that China will firmly stand with the justice and fairness upheld by the majority of the international community, rather than submit to hegemony.On the Ukraine crisis, the document said: ""No one gains from conflicts and wars. Imposing sanctions, exerting pressure, or adding fuel to the fire will only escalate the situation. It is important to maintain mutual respect, abandon the Cold War mentality, stop ganging up to stoke camp-based confrontation, and work to build a balanced, effective and sustainable European security architecture.""On the Korean Peninsula nuclear crisis, the document said: ""Given the current situation, parties concerned need to remain calm and restrained, work to ease the situation and make efforts to create conditions for the resumption of dialogue, rather than insisting on sanctions and pressuring, which would only aggravate problems and escalate tensions.""Li Haidong, a professor at the China Foreign Affairs University, told the Global Times on Wednesday that ""currently, global governance faces huge challenges of turbulence, splits and confrontation, and in order to ensure security, stability and sustainable prosperity, we need positive, effective and well-accepted ideas for global governance and ensure they are implemented. This proposal is truly needed under the current situation.""The thinking of the US and the West on global governance is outdated and getting increasingly dysfunctional, and the ongoing turbulence around the globe is proof. The old Western-dominated rules and ideas are based on unfairness, bullying and plundering against developing countries, and these have brought huge risks to the world, and created splits and confrontations, Li noted.  ""China's idea for global governance is made to counter the unfairness and imbalances,"" Li said. On the Palestine-Israel issue, the document said: ""It is important to keep to the right direction of peace talks, respect the historical status quo of the holy sites in Jerusalem, refrain from making radical and provocative comments and moves, promote the hosting of an international peace conference with wider participation, higher authority and greater influence, create conditions for the resumption of peace talks, and make concrete efforts to help the two states of Palestine and Israel to coexist peacefully.""China believes that regional hot spots such as the Iranian nuclear issue and the issues of Syria, Sudan, Libya and Yemen need to be resolved through political means. China supports Middle East countries in independently exploring development paths, resolving regional security issues through solidarity and coordination, and maintaining lasting peace and security in the region, said the proposal.Wang Yiwei, director of the Institute of International Affairs at the Renmin University of China, told the Global Times that the document is not only covering the ongoing hotspot issues and long-standing geopolitical crises, but also eyes the future.""The deep sea, polar regions, outer space, cyberspace and digital technology and artificial intelligence (AI) have become the new frontiers of global governance. Faced with the new circumstances, new areas and new challenges, we need to follow the principles of peace, development, inclusiveness and shared governance, and take active steps to keep the rules governing new frontiers up to date with the times and fully reflective of developing countries' opinions, interests and aspirations. The rights to participation, stating their views, and decision-making of developing countries should be fully safeguarded,"" said the proposal.The international community should commit to upholding a cyberspace featuring peace, security, openness and cooperation, and oppose the camp-based division, militarization and fragmentation of cyberspace, the document said. ""No party should overstretch the concept of national security, or unscrupulously deprive another country of its legitimate right to development. Advantage in cyber technologies should not be used to spread aggressive cyber technologies, or turn cyberspace into a new battleground for geopolitical competition,"" the proposal reads.In these ""new frontiers,"" the UN system has yet to cover them all with sophisticated rules, so it is important for China to present its stance, to stress that the new frontiers should not become arenas for major power competition and should not be weaponized and militarized. They should be shared by the whole humanity, and while now some countries are unable to enter these new frontiers like outer space, the countries with advantages should preserve and safeguard their rights, Wang noted.",CHINA,SOCIETY,Ministry of Foreign Affairs,"Reporter, Beijing","Yang Sheng is a chief reporter at the Global Times covering Chinese politics, diplomacy and military.",29,963,<FreqDist with 18 samples and 570 outcomes>

China Post issues commemorative stamp to mark 10th anniversary of BRI,Global Times,2023-09-10,"To celebrate the 10th anniversary of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), the China Post recently issued a commemorative stamp inspired by the country's commitment to building a global community of shared future.The stamp is printed with ""The 10th Anniversary of the Belt and Road Initiative"" in Chinese and English. A golden number 10 is set in the center of the stamp, while the background abstractly combines the Earth's meridians and parallels, symbolizing the bright future of building a community of shared future for mankind through the BRI. The golden bridge below the number is an art installation - Golden Bridge on the Silk Road by Chinese artist Shu Yong. Based on the ancient Zhaozhou Bridge in North China's Hebei Province, the installation work conveys a message of a global community of shared future. It has been widely regarded as a cultural symbol of the BRI. It has been a core art installation at high-level events like the Milan Expo in 2015 and the Belt and Road Forum in Beijing in 2017.""Stamps can be seen as a country's name card as well as a national symbol that tell Chinese stories about the new era. Being part of the design team meant very much to me personally and professionally,"" Shu told the Global Times. ""Bridges hold a distinctive connotation in Chinese culture. It represents building a channel for connection and communication. Including the bridge in the stamp is not only an acknowledgment to my work, but also shows the essence of the BRI,"" Shu noted. Over the past decade, the BRI has followed the guiding principles of extensive consultation, joint contribution and shared benefits, which led to the inspiration for the central number 10 being composed of various shipping, air traffic and logistics logos as well as flowers.""The China-Laos Railway, the new Haifa port in Israel, the Jakarta-Bandung High-Speed Railway… So many examples come to our mind when we think about the connectivity projects that are delivering tangible benefits to local residents via the BRI,"" Shu explained.  As a saying goes, ""a single flower does not make a spring."" Different flowers bloom for the unique cultures from different countries across the world, further elaborating on the flowers in the central number, he said.""It expresses China's commitment to deepening mutual learning among civilizations for a shared bright future, as well as its goodwill for common prosperity and development of all countries in the world,"" Shu said.The China Post plans to issue 7.05 million copies of the commemorative stamp at 1.2 yuan (16 cents) per stamp. In addition to the stamp, the China Post, Hongkong Post and Macao Post and Telecommunications are jointly presenting a stamp booklet containing stamps and stamp sheetlets to mark the BRI's 10th anniversary together.",ARTS,CULTURE & LEISURE,Photo: Courtesy of Shu Yong,Author details not found,Author details not found,21,441,<FreqDist with 13 samples and 256 outcomes>
"US railway plan in Middle East will be another case of 'much said, little done': Chinese experts",GT staff reporters,2023-09-09,"As the US announced its Middle East railway plan during the Group of 20 (G20) Summit over the weekend in India, Chinese experts expressed doubts about its credibility and feasibility, saying that it is not the first time for Washington to make empty pledges to various countries and regions.The experts noted that the true purpose of the Biden administration is trying to ""isolate China"" in the Middle East, a region where Chinese cooperation with the region has constantly gained momentum in recent years.The comment followed an announcement by US President Joe Biden and India regarding a multinational railway and port deal linking the Middle East and South Asia. The announcement came on Saturday on the sidelines of the G20 Summit.Biden said it was a ""real big deal"" that would bridge ports across two continents and lead to a ""more stable, more prosperous and integrated Middle East,"" according to a Reuters report.The idea of the rail and port network initially emerged at the I2U2 Business Forum, launched in 2021 by the US, India, Israel and the UAE to discuss infrastructure projects in the Middle East. Saudi Arabia joined the discussions later.Zhou Rong, a senior researcher at the Chongyang Institute for Financial Studies at Renmin University of China, told the Global Times on Saturday that the US lacks both the genuine intention and the capability to follow through on its pledge to build up the transportation network in the Middle East.""It is not the first time that the US has been involved in a 'much said, little done' scenario,"" Zhou said.During the Obama administration, then US secretary of state Hillary Clinton announced that the US would sponsor a ""New Silk Road"" that would emerge from Afghanistan to link the country with its neighbors to increase its economic potential, but the initiative never materialized.""The Biden administration's Middle East infrastructure plan is an apparent effort to counter the China-proposed Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), which is entering its 10th year in 2023 with brought fruitful projects to partnering countries and regions. The Biden administration is again engaging in bloc politics in order to slow down China's development,"" Zhou said.The recent moves by the US in the Middle East are more reactive than proactive, given China's stronger presence, Liu Zhongmin, a professor at the Middle East Studies Institute of Shanghai International Studies University, told the Global Times on Saturday.China has been engaging with the Middle East through the BRI for years. Its peacemaker role in the Saudi-Iran detente is lauded by the international community, the countries in the region in particular, which has injected stability into the region.In areas such as infrastructure construction, cooperation between the Gulf countries and China has advanced significantly in recent years. ""It is impossible for the US to create a hedge in the short term,"" Liu said.Zhou described the US plan as ""more of a symbolic gesture."" From a technical perspective, the US decision to focus on transport infrastructure, an area where it lacks expertise, in a bid to salvage its declining influence in the region, suggests that the highly touted plan is unlikely to be realized. ""In terms of the technology and costs of building railways, no country in the world than China has a more prominent advantage. What the Middle Eastern countries want from the US is not just a railway, but also security. However, the US has neither provided nor been able to bring security to the region; instead, it has complicated the security situation there. This is the dilemma the US is facing in the Middle East,"" Ding Long, a professor with the Middle East Studies Institute of Shanghai International Studies University, told the Global Times.For Middle Eastern countries that will participate in the US-led railway initiative, there is no concern that their ties with China will weaken just because of the deal, instead, they will continue maintaining close cooperation with the world's second-largest economy, Zhou said.""In fact, the US' ability to influence its allies in the Middle East is shrinking, and Saudi Arabia and the UAE have recently joined the BRICS cooperation mechanism. I think the two countries will exercise prudence in the issue,"" Liu said.""China welcomes all initiatives that can help pool synergy and promote global infrastructure development. Any calculation to advance geopolitics in the name of infrastructure development will win no support and will never succeed,"" a spokesperson for Chinese Foreign Ministry said in June 2022 on the US' plan to roll out a new infrastructure plan to counter the China-proposed BRI.There are no such thing as different initiatives countering or replacing each other. The world needs more bridges to be built rather than torn down, more connectivity rather than decoupling or building fences, and mutual benefits rather than isolation and exclusion, the spokesperson said.",WORLD,MID-EAST,Illustration: Chen Xia/GT,Author details not found,Author details not found,30,770,<FreqDist with 17 samples and 431 outcomes>

Hungary's participation in the BRI a testament to its commitment to opening up to the East,Global Times,2023-09-02,"Editor's Note:This year marks the 10th anniversary of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) proposed by Chinese President Xi Jinping. Through the lens of foreign pundits, we take a look at 10 years of the BRI - how it achieves win-win cooperation between China and countries along the Belt and Road and how it has given the people of these countries a sense of fulfillment. In a conversation with Global Times (GT) reporter Wang Wenwen, Dr. Norbert Csizmadia (Csizmadia), former state secretary in charge of planning coordination for the Hungarian Ministry for National Economy, former executive director for Central Bank of Hungary, president of board of trustees for John Von Neumann University, and independent director of the Bank of China Hungary, shared his views on the China-Hungary cooperation under the BRI. Csizmadia  believes that Hungary's participation in the BRI is a testament to its commitment to opening up to the East. This is the 12th piece of the series.GT: What do you think of the advancement and development of the BRI over the past 10 years?Csizmadia: The BRI is of utmost importance for a geographer and geopolitical thinker. It represents a unique and transformative global order. The BRI is not only the largest investment plan in human history; it marked the beginning of a new era for Eurasia. The BRI is of great significance today due to its emphasis on three crucial aspects under the multipolar geopolitical world order: connectivity, complexity, and sustainability. The main mission and vision of BRI are to redirect the economic axis from the ocean to the mainland. It goes beyond just promoting trade and investment; it aims to build a global civilization that fosters ecological and job growth. Today, sustainability is becoming increasingly vital. The BRI represents a path toward peace, prosperity, innovation, and green development. It aims to connect civilizations, nations, countries, cities and people.The BRI's impact is evident in various sectors, including commerce, where it fosters stronger connections between the EU and China. This increased connectivity carries immense significance for the global economy and international relations. We take great pride that Hungary was the first European country to join this transformative initiative.GT: How does the BRI promote relations between China and Hungary?Csizmadia: China and Hungary have enjoyed strong and fluid cooperation. There are around several direct flights from Budapest to various cities in China, such as Shanghai, Ningbo, Beijing and Chongqing. China and Hungary have collaborated in at least five key fields, including economic and infrastructure development, sustainable development, fair competition, investment promotion, and innovation collaboration. For example, there is a railway network connecting more than 160 cities in 22 European countries. Notably, the Budapest-Belgrade railway is one of the most significant infrastructure developments. It connects not only Budapest and Belgrade but also serves as a vital connection linking Piraeus to Hamburg across Europe. The Middle Corridor is also becoming increasingly important for future cooperation.Hungary's ""Eastern Opening"" policy aligns well with the determined development of Europe's future. In the long run, cooperation between the East and the West fosters sustainable economic and social development. Hungary's participation in the BRI is a testament to its commitment to opening up to the East. The project in Hungary has seen fruitful cooperation between China and Hungary in areas such as energy, climate governance, and technological innovation.Hungary's strategic geographical location at the heart of Europe, along with its strong industrial base, makes it an essential partner for China. Economic foreign investments from China have been attracted to Hungary due to its membership in the EU, making it a competitive destination for real investments. Hungary serves as a strong gateway between the West and the East, boasting robust political and economic stability, a distinct cultural identity, strong connectivity, and a well-established industrial base.

Norbert Csizmadia Photo: Courtesy of CsizmadiaGT: Italy is said moving to withdraw from the BRI. Is Hungary facing any pressure regarding cooperation with China?Csizmadia: The current Hungarian government values the BRI's stability and independence and are determined to follow their own path and do not appreciate being told to do what to do by other countries.It is very important to understand geopolitics in the right way. Just like Yin and Yang, there are differences between the North and South. Everyone, including the US and Western countries, always thinks about the East and West. I believe the real thing we should focus on is learning from China's geoeconomic thinking. So, it's not just about the importance of the North and South geographically. Geographically in the North, you can find vast lands and focus on energy, pipelines, infrastructure, and logistics - what I call ""hardware."" The Eurasian region in the South, on the other hand, characterized by numerous islands, prioritizes efficient transport systems, including main transportation hubs, airplane connections, and maritime links, making it faster and more connected. As a result, the focus in the southern part lies on the ""software"" aspect, such as intellectual culture, technological software, and financial cooperation.GT: The EU has proposed the Global Gateway to counter the BRI. Do you believe it will be effective in Europe? Can it be seen as an alternative to the BRI?Csizmadia: No, I don't see it as an alternative. It reflects a Western perspective. China's approach is about cooperation, connectivity, and a peaceful win-win situation. I recall the first EU-China Forum in 2018, which was crucial. The EU's Global Gateway proposal, following the BRI, might be problematic in terminology. ""Belt and Road"" signifies connectivity, while ""Gateway"" implies merely an entry point. The program entails an investment of about 300 billion euros. Today, we live in a multipolar world . Europe's issue lies in its technological competitiveness, which extends beyond recent times. Europe must grow stronger, focusing on cooperation. Hungary exemplifies this as a European nation, emphasizing peaceful collaboration, not just with China or the Belt and Road but also with other Asian countries.For instance, as a geographer, I've come to realize that throughout history, lucky latitudes from Shenzhen to Lisbon, spanning over 10,000 years, have housed philosophical civilizations. The East-to-West spread of agricultural revolutions symbolized harmony and peace. Thus, the revival of the ancient Silk Road is of utmost importance. The lucky latitudes, however, is undergoing a shift. I've identified what I term the ""KIDSingChi Axis"" - Korea, Israel, Dubai, Singapore, China's hubs, and global financial centers like Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen, Chongqing and Chengdu, which epitomize innovation.Looking forward, Hungary, as a role model, needs to identify what this global gateway hub can contribute to the world: education, technological vision, tourism, creative and culture industry, health industry and strong values. Additionally, we need to focus on three other key aspects: complexity, connectivity, and sustainability.GT: The EU, following the US, has been calling for an economic ""de-risking"" from China. What do you think of this term? Do you think it deviates from global trade trends?Csizmadia: Our approach should be focused on a sovereign, pragmatic and positive perspective. How can we foster connectivity? I believe the best way to achieve this is through China's BRI. Let's take the example of the Northern Eurasian corridor. Amid challenges like the Ukraine-Russia crisis and sanctions between the EU and Russia, there's an ambition to construct a special ""dam"" across Europe and Asia by the Northern Eurasian corridor. As the result, the Middle Corridor strengthens. Kazakhstan connects through Turkey, reaching Istanbul, Budapest and other Western and European countries, bringing more opportunities. Amid concerns about risks voiced by the EU, Hungary's belief in peace as the ultimate outcome resonates with our vision for a future of peaceful, rising and harmonious cooperation. For any nation to succeed, its vision for the future must be founded on strong values, emphasizing education, talent, technology, and culture. Furthermore, we should explore how this model can adapt to diverse nations, fostering peaceful connections. This perspective is pivotal, and it's how I perceive the situation.",OPINION,VIEWPOINT,"A construction site of the Hungary-Serbia railway project in Taksony station, Hungary.

"US warships provoke in S.China Sea, but don't help fight fires in Hawaii: Global Times editorial",Global Times,2023-08-16,"After a week of fierce wildfires in parts of Hawaii's Maui Island in the US, the death toll continues to rise. As of Tuesday noon local time, 99 people have died and over 1,000 remain missing. This has been labeled by the US media as the deadliest wildfires in the country in a century. The dire situation in the affected areas has inflicted immense psychological shock upon the American people. Reports said local residents have ""lost everything,"" with some even being ""forced to jump into the Pacific Ocean to escape the smoke and fire conditions."" Criticisms of failures in warnings, inadequate disaster relief efforts, and inaction from the stationed US military in Hawaii have fueled ""growing anger.""Such a large number of casualties would be a major disaster in any country, and it is even more shocking when it occurs in the world's most developed country. The US is prone to natural disasters such as wildfires and hurricanes. However, the country's patchy response when dealing with these disasters is perplexing. The US has always proclaimed itself as a ""world leader"" and claims to be capable of responding rapidly to security threats around the globe. It possesses over 800 military bases overseas and projects its military power with aircraft carriers worldwide. But when it comes to domestic disasters or public safety incidents within the US, its response is slow and its ability to cope seems inadequate.Although Hawaii is not located on the continental US, it remains one of the most critical military bases for the country. Hawaii serves as the headquarters of the US Indo-Pacific Command. The Indo-Pacific Command claims to ""govern"" over 50 percent of the world's surface area, but ironically remains indifferent to the disasters that occur in its own location. What has fueled anger among the local community is the fact that the initial relief work was largely organized by residents themselves, with little presence from the National Guard, Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), state government, or local authorities. An American internet user sarcastically remarked, ""Our warships can provoke China in the South China Sea, they can shadow China in Alaska, but they can't come to Hawaii to help Americans."" This aptly illustrates the hierarchy of decision-making in the US.US sluggish and indifferent response to its domestic catastrophic incidents sharply contrasts with its fervent resource mobilization in ""competition"" with other nations. Leaving a deep impression on us, there was the Hurricane ""Katrina"" in 2005 that resulted in the loss of 1,836 lives, and the train derailment in East Palestine earlier this year carrying hazardous chemicals. There was also the Florida building collapse in 2021 that claimed 98 lives, and the slow rescue efforts during that time were referred to as ""archaeological-style rescue."" A foreign netizen said, ""The 'American-style rescue' in Hollywood movies is nowhere to be seen, with no American rescue heroes or high-tech equipment."" This observation seems to be perfectly fitting for every disaster in America, including the current Hawaii wildfires.While the wildfires were raging in Hawaii, what was Washington busy with? It was occupied with imposing investment restrictions on China, preparing for the Camp David summit with Japan and South Korea, and announcing $200 million in new military aid to Ukraine. However, the specific amount of assistance provided by the FEMA for the Hawaii wildfires, as announced to date, is a payment of $700 per household. The few discussions about the wildfires mostly serve as the latest pretext for mutual attacks between the two parties. The American media, which has always emphasized ""supervision,"" seems to consider all of this as a matter of course, leading to the repetition of the same events without any profound reflection.The US actively exercises hegemony in its foreign affairs, and its internal mechanisms are very backward, failing to take the protection of citizens' security as the starting point and foundation of national security. Specifically, the US wastes a large amount of resources meaninglessly in fighting against ""imaginary external opponents,"" while ignoring the life-threatening threats faced by its domestic population. The US focuses its investment in military power and military-related technological fields in terms of national security, while investing inadequately in domestic infrastructure construction, disaster reduction, and relief efforts that concern people's wellbeing and national security.The problems exposed by the deadly wildfires in Hawaii belong to the entire US. We can see that from the ""9/11"" attacks to the present, the US has witnessed numerous major events related to citizens' security. However, there has been almost no obvious improvement in the construction of institutional mechanisms for responding to domestic disasters and accidents by the US government. The US government prefers to hype harmless balloon accidents as major security threats, but remains ""calm"" about the tragic disasters causing significant casualties right in front of it. When the next disaster strikes, the performance of the US government is unlikely to be any better. Every disaster is a reminder to the US, using innocent lives to remind it who its real enemies and challenges are. The US' disregard for this reminder is the greatest desecration of the lives lost.",OPINION,EDITORIAL,"Carcasses of cars can be seen among the ashes of a burnt neighborhood in the aftermath of a wildfire, as observed in Lahaina, western Maui, Hawaii on August 14, 2023.

"Iran seeks closer BRI cooperation to counter US hegemony, unilateralism",Global Times,2023-08-06," 
Editor's Note:This year marks the 10th anniversary of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) proposed by Chinese President Xi Jinping. Through the lens of foreign pundits, we take a look at 10 years of the BRI - how it achieves win-win cooperation between China and countries along the Belt and Road and how it increases people's sense of fulfillment in these countries.Hamed Vafaei (Vafaei), chair of Chinese Language and Literature at University of Tehran, shared with Global Times (GT) reporters Su Yaxuan and Li Aixin his understanding of the BRI and his expectations for the initiative in the near future.This is the eighth piece of the series.GT: What do you think of the progress and achievements of the BRI over the past decade? How do local Iranians view and assess the BRI?Vafaei: Iran is one of the world's oldest civilizations, and its ties with China can be traced back centuries. The two nations have maintained excellent cultural, economic and political relations. Iran enthusiastically backed the BRI from the start. Universities and think tanks in Iran are researching the possibility of collaboration between the two nations. A growing number of students are also opting to study at Confucius Institutes in Iran.The BRI has accomplished a great deal during the last decade. China's influence in Iran has recently grown, as seen in the improving Iran-Saudi relations and the Iran nuclear issue. After the COVID-19 pandemic ended, Chinese businesses have resumed collaboration with Iran. Many Chinese entrepreneurs are researching the possibility of collaboration with Iran, highlighting the significant investment and cooperation potential in Iran. Also, Iranians are highly open to Chinese business people, artists and scientists, and they are ready to work with them more than ever. Iranian enterprises, in particular, seek to join the BRI cooperation projects. Iranians have been actively discussing the topic since the introduction of the BRI, including the impact of the BRI on both China and Iran. Many nations and academics around the world worry that US hegemony and unilateralism are destroying the present international order. In contrast, they are more welcoming of China, and many people are eager to understand what the BRI entails, and they have discovered that some policies inside the initiative's framework are win-win and just. Iranians are also aware that China promotes multilateralism and win-win collaboration, so the BRI is widely welcomed. During the past 10 years, I believe they have comprehended it.GT: Within the framework of the BRI, what specifically has been achieved through China-Iran cooperation?Vafaei: To begin, in terms of the economy, China has boosted cooperation in trade and investment, notably in energy and infrastructure, in the aftermath of the pandemic.I believe there have also been important diplomatic successes. During the implementation of the BRI, China and Iran entered a new era in their diplomatic ties. This covers, among other things, the Iran Nuclear Deal, the breakthrough of ties between Saudi Arabia and Iran, and China-Iran cooperation in the Persian Gulf. The potential for future cooperation between the two countries is enormous. Now Iran and China have a comprehensive strategic partnership. This indicates that Iran and China place each other in a comprehensive position. A comprehensive strategic partnership has three key elements: First, the two countries should be partners rather than adversaries; second, this partnership is based on the strategic global situation, not just local issues, and it is long-term; third, this strategic partnership is constructive, not exclusive.GT: How do you see the prospect for China-Iran collaboration within the BRI framework?Vafaei: Personally, I think there are still some obstacles preventing the two nations' collaboration, such as US sanctions. However, the global environment is changing. Over the past 50 years, particularly during the Cold War, many countries have been harmed by US hegemony. They therefore oppose unilateralism and are in favor of multilateralism which China advocates. Multilateral diplomatic relations with China are actively being promoted by many nations. Therefore, I think there will be novel possibilities for Iran and China to work together in the future.Moreover, Iran is also a major player in the Middle East, particularly in the energy sector. And China has the second-largest economy in the world. There is tremendous room for cooperation between the two nations on all fronts, including the political, military, national security and economic ones. Future cooperation will undoubtedly benefit both nations if they genuinely explore the possibilities for cooperation and develop plans.GT: Saudi Arabia and Iran have resumed diplomatic ties with China's mediation. Do you think it's possible for China, Iran and Saudi Arabia to collaborate together under the BRI? In which areas do you believe collaboration is most likely?Vafaei: I firmly believe that it is achievable. China has played a crucial role in bridging the gap between Saudi Arabia and Iran, fostering relations between the two nations and contributing to stability and peace in the Middle East. It is also very likely that Saudi Arabia and Iran will work together in a trilateral capacity as part of the BRI.However, a prerequisite for this cooperation is that Saudi Arabia and Iran can effectively leverage China's potential and practices to deepen mutual trust in terms of economy, politics, and national security. I hope the cooperation among the three countries can gradually progress, starting with cultural and economic aspects, such as opening up tourism after the pandemic and mutual business establishment, and gradually transitioning to national strategies and security.GT: Western nations, particularly the US, have described the BRI implementation as a means to compete for regional dominance, branding it as a ""debt trap."" What do you think about this description?Vafaei: In my opinion, the US' Cold War attitude is the biggest issue facing Western nations. Some Western nations have been using a Cold War lens to view contemporary international phenomena. A typical example is their perception of the BRI.When they approach the BRI with a Cold War mentality, they inevitably adopt a zero-sum perspective and assume that China aims to replace the US. However, if they can move beyond the Cold War mindset, they will realize that their initial stance is incorrect. In today's world, we do not seek conflict as it is no longer the Cold War era.Under the terms of the BRI architecture and agreements, debt traps won't be created. I consider the phrase ""debt trap"" to be extremely odd and absurd. Western nations' opinions of China and the BRI are flawed because of their lack of awareness of the global environment. They must acknowledge that the time of American hegemony and unilateralism is over. The phrase ""debt trap"" will vanish as soon as people accept this.I have a favorable outlook on China-Iran collaboration. We have numerous cooperation groups, such as the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, BRICS, and other East Asian institutions, thanks to the Belt and Road and China's proactive diplomacy, despite the barriers to good relations between the two nations. They will take an especially active part and offer a fantastic setting for collaboration.GT: The US has been continuously adding pressure through sanctions on Iran for many years. How do you evaluate this behavior by the US? Which aspects do you think the BRI has alleviated the crisis caused by US sanctions on Iran?Vafaei: Without a doubt, the illegal sanctions imposed by the US have had a negative impact on the Iranian people's daily lives. Many Iranians, especially patients, are unable to get necessary medications as a result of these restrictions. Additionally, many companies are unable to engage in international business, which impedes Iran's development. All of this is a result of American hegemony, which not only goes against the interests of the Iranian people but also undermines regional and global stability by disrupting the security and stability of Iran and the Middle East. Undoubtedly, the US also aims to sabotage the fruitful and deep partnership between China and Iran. It continues to disregard the shift away from unilateralism and US-centered hegemony.China is an influential country, and the entire nation of Iran excitedly anticipates that collaboration between the two countries, notably within the BRI, can have a favorable impact on offsetting the US sanctions. China has often denounced the harmful acts taken by the US in relation to the Iran nuclear agreement. Iran seeks to collaborate more closely with China under the BRI framework to counter US hegemony and unilateralism.There are many other issues in the world, including the Israel-Palestine issue, the Iran-Saudi issue, the Russia-Ukraine issue, and various issues in African countries. Many people around the world, after witnessing China's influence and understanding its foreign policy and attitude, hope to see China play an active role in these international issues.China, Iran and the majority of nations have interests in a multilateral setting. Both nations share similar political views, and have common interests. Therefore, I am confident that China and Iran will work together more closely in the future given their cordial relationship and shared interests, and the Belt and Road will be crucial to this.",OPINION,VIEWPOINT,Photo: VCG,Author details not found,Author details not found,74,1451,<FreqDist with 17 samples and 810 outcomes>

First Chinese female 100-meter freediver explains the sport in her eyes,Lou Kang,2023-08-01,"
What does it feel like to dive 100 meters deep under the surface of the ocean with one breath? ""The hydrostatic pressure will be 11 times than that a person feels on the ground,"" Xu Tongtong, Chinese freediver and the country's record breaker, told the Global Times in a recent interview.A person now titled with two record-breaking champions, the 35-year-old Xu is now the first woman of China reaching 100 meters under the sea level in history, after she claimed a gold in Constant weight (CWT) freediving discipline in Asian Freediving Cup in the Philippines in June.The win of her first 100-meter try gave her courage. During July, in another competition she participated in AIDA Panglao Depth Championship in Bohol Island, the Philippines, Xu finished her another 100-meter challenge in the Constant weight bi-fins (CWTB) depth discipline, ranking second place in the world.""If we compare the 100 meters to the height of a building, it means we are about to jump from the 30th floor to the ground and then climb back to the roof top, with one breath,"" Xu added. ""I feel so happy when I touched and grabbed the tab underwater. This was a goal I set for myself three years ago, and I feel nice that the world can see the efforts we made as Chinese freediving athletes,"" she told the Global Times in an interview on the phone at her home in the Philippines.The two records Xu set pushed China to reach the next level: Since then the depth record of Chinese women in freediving has entered the 100-meter level.'First try'Xu now lives in Boho Island, an area covering an area of 3,269 kilometers and known as top island in the Philippines.The Boho Island has been boasting its hospitality of the freediving lovers. And it is also among the most popular freediving destinations in the country where international competitions are often held here.But for Xu, the place means much more than a freediving heaven, as both of the two competitions she participated in with record breaking also took place here in Boho Island.June's competition is her first ever try in challenging 100 meters freediving. ""I made it,"" recalled Xu. ""That was an unprecedented experience for me as I remembered my smile as I swam up out of the surface."" Before heading to the competition, she undergone a three-month systematic training where her coach developed a training program cut out for her. ""There were different proportions I needed to devote to in including the physical training and muscle training.""Based on her training plan, the last training Xu had the free diving reached 98 meters under the water. ""By two meters deeper during each try, I would reach 100 meters by the time of my competition day.""""This needs a stable state of mind. If you're nervous you fail, but if you're not you win,"" Xu added.Explaining the trick of the sport, Xu said that it is the opposite of the others as one needs to calm her/him down to be ""as stable as possible in order to slow down the heart rate, which is essential to reduce the oxygen consumption.""A yearn for oceanBorn in Anhui, a landlocked province in East China, the 35-year-old free diver has a nickname Mutou, translated as wood often known by her friends. She also named her social media atlas after Mutou.She believed in the flexibility of the wood as ""a piece of wood can be carved into anything you want. And I wish I can have the quality just as the wood.""Xu started her swimming training as early as 8. Being a professional swimmer, Xu has participated in a string of competitions nationwide, where she won second place as her best result. Xu's free diving enlightenment came from a video she accidentally came across on social media. As early as 2012, when she saw the famous French freediving champion Guillaume Néry ""flying"" in the ocean.""Normally we swim horizontally, but I never try swimming vertically. And I decided to have a try.""From 2012 to 2017, Xu has traveled to islands across the world for freediving, where she would immerse in the enjoyment the ocean brought her.""If we carry gas cylinders, the bubbles that pop out will keep those sea creatures from approaching us. We are just 'guests' in the ocean, and in the ocean, we are so small,"" said Xu.In the years of her career in ocean, she also received help from Israeli freediving legend Aharon Solomons, who she met in China when the later traveled there for freediving classes.According to Solomons, freediving is a kind of sport that requires intelligence, commitments and common sense, where he believed that Xu has all of them. Among many sports, freediving can be dangerous, but ""she has been outstanding,"" Solomons told the Global Times in an interview.""I also feel honored that he coached me during my entering stage of the sport, and I've never experienced from a single injury,"" Xu recalled her experience when learning from Solomons.Now in Israel, Solomons is still preparing for more competitions as he told the Global Times.",SPORT,WATER SPORT,"Xu Tongtong, first Chinese female 100-meter freediver won a gold in Constant weight (CWT) freediving discipline in Asian Freediving Cup in the Philippines in June.",Author details not found,Author details not found,40,819,<FreqDist with 19 samples and 426 outcomes>

"Xi holds talks with Tebboune, pledges to enhance bilateral relations",Deng Xiaoci,2023-07-19,"Chinese President Xi Jinping held talks with visiting Algerian President Abdelmadjid Tebboune in Beijing on Tuesday, and during their meeting held at the Great Hall of the People, Xi pledged that ""China is willing to work with Algeria to carry forward the traditional friendship and push for greater development of China-Algeria comprehensive strategic partnership.""Chinese analysts hailed that this year marks the 65th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic ties between the two nations, and at such a key juncture of bilateral ties, they have great expectations that Tebboune's visit will bring about constructive outcomes, deepen strategic cooperation between two sides in areas such as public health and expand scopes of cooperation in industrial sectors such as energy and digital economy.   Xi told Tebboune on Tuesday that China and Algeria are sincere friends and natural partners in pursuing common development and national rejuvenation, the Xinhua News Agency reported.Xi stressed that the two sides should support each other on issues concerning their respective core interests.He thanked Algeria for its staunch support for China's just position on Taiwan question, Xinjiang-related affairs and human rights issue. China firmly supports Algeria in safeguarding its national sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity, supports Algeria in pursuing a development path suited to its national conditions, and opposes external interference in its internal affairs, Xi said.He called on the two sides to cooperate on the Belt and Road Initiative, deepen partnership in traditional areas such as infrastructure, petrochemicals, minerals and agriculture, expand cooperation in high-tech areas such as aerospace, nuclear energy, information and telecommunications, and renewable energy, and foster new growth points.China will continue to provide assistance within its capacity to support Algeria's economic and social development, and will import more quality products from the country and encourage Chinese enterprises to do business there, Xi said. For his part, Tebboune said that China is Algeria's most important friend and partner. He expressed gratitude to China for its long-term valuable support to Algeria and its firm support for China's position on core interests involving Taiwan and Xinjiang. Algeria supports China's Global Development Initiative, Global Security Initiative, and Global Civilization Initiative, and is willing to actively participate in the construction of the BRI, deepen the comprehensive strategic partnership between Algeria and China, and help Algeria achieve national economic and social development. Algeria appreciates China's key role in promoting the construction of a more open and inclusive world and forming a more just and reasonable international order. Algeria commends China's constructive role in achieving a fair solution to regional hotspots such as Palestine and promoting regional and world peace and stability. Algeria is willing to closely cooperate with China in international and regional affairs, Tebboune said. After the meeting, the two heads of state witnessed the signing of multiple bilateral cooperation documents in the fields of agriculture, transportation, science and technology, telecommunications, sustainable urban development, trade, aerospace, inspection and quarantine, energy, education and sports.Liu Qinghai, head of the Center for African Economic Studies at the Institute of African Studies at Zhejiang Normal University, highlighted the cooperation between two countries in the space domain, citing the launch of Alcomsat-1 for example. In 2017, China launched Algeria's first communication satellite, Alcomsat-1, into a preset orbit, the first cooperative project in aerospace industry between the two countries. Algeria's broadcast and television and other sectors have been improved after the successful launch of the satellite, Liu told the Global Times on Tuesday.US media AP speculated that Tebboune is looking for concrete support for Algerian membership in BRICS, an economic bloc that includes both China and Russia as well as Brazil, India and South Africa, which is hosting a summit next month, as BRICS membership has become a diplomatic priority for Algeria with the upending of the global economy, notably due to Russia-Ukraine conflict. The report pointed out that Tebboune's China visit came shortly after his trip to Russia in June. It would not be surprising for Algeria to seek to join BRICS, and the bloc would also need to expand its scale to better pursue the grouping's original aspiration to make the world political and economic order fairer, Wang Yiwei, director of the Institute of International Affairs at the Renmin University of China, told the Global Times on Tuesday. After witnessing the US-led West moves to confiscate Russian individuals' legitimate assets and kick Russian banks out of world financial systems with sanctions, developing countries including Algeria and Global South economies have seen the evil intention of US hegemony and therefore have the urgent need for de-dollarization, Wang said, explaining why more countries are increasingly active in seeking BRICS membership. However, Chinese analysts believe that Algerian membership in BRICS could just be one of the topics for discussion and exchanges, and more constructive outcomes could be expected during the five-day in-depth state visit that comes at a key juncture for China-Algeria bilateral ties. This year also marks the 60th anniversary of China sending medical teams to Algeria. Over the past 60 years, China has sent 3,522 medical personnel to Algeria, treating more than 27 million patients and delivering more than 2.07 million newborns, which has established a monument of friendship between China and Algeria, Xi told the visiting Algerian leader on Tuesday. Both sides may continue their close cooperation in the field of public health beyond vaccine cooperation, such as expanding personnel training, keeping up the good momentum picked up during the pandemic, He Wenping, director of the African Studies Section at the Institute of West Asian and African Studies under the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times on Tuesday.They will also explore new areas of development, such as natural gas and photovoltaic energy.

""I'd also like to share some of Taiwan's cuisine and talk about the island's beautiful landscape to create a sense of comradery with those I meet."" Miasu made her debut on Mango TV show Qingnian Jihua's second episode, showcasing her vocal range as she made powerful transitions from baritone to high-octave notes, stunning audiences and judges.  The show features outstanding young talents from all over the world including emerging stars from both sides of the Taiwan Straits to compete on the same stage, birthing a new generation of taste-setters in the new-generation music scene. Bigger stage, more opportunitiesThe Chinese mainland is a hotbed of young, fresh talents in the music industry, as it provides a larger stage for such talents to thrive and innovate unique sounds and styles of music. Shows like Qingnian Jihua (Lit: Youth Plan) reflect the Chinese mainland's spirit of cultural inclusiveness and openness, as it offers a platform to singers from various walks of life on which to nurture and develop their talent.  More and more artists from the island of Taiwan have made their way to the Chinese mainland, where they have a wider audience for whom they can perform.  Veteran singers Aska Yang, Jeff Chang and Richie Jen have taken part in the show Infinity and Beyond, while Cyndi Wang and Alyssa Chia rose to fame through appearances on Sisters Riding The Winds And Breaking The Waves respectively. Such success stories serve as inspiration to other aspiring artists wishing to make their way to the mainland to pursue their dreams.Accompanied by singers Zhang Jie and Chen Linong at the variety show Infinity and Beyond, singer Angela Zhang sang ""Yeliya Girl,"" a tune written 34 years ago that harkened the ""golden age"" of Mandopop that swept over both sides of the Straits.  As a pop icon dedicated to being a bridge between both sides of the Straits, Zhang has participated in numerous shows on the Chinese mainland such as The Treasured Voice aired on Zhejiang TV, with the aim of expanding Mandopop's global influence. ""I live here and I have met so many people who love me and like me. I want to respect this land. It's a mutual respect between people,"" Zhang told the Global Times, as Mandopop enjoys increasing popularity around the world. ""Chinese culture has lasted for more than 5,000 years and it is necessary to continue to pass it down. They are our roots,"" said Zhang.Actress and singer Alyssa Chia expressed her hope of taking part in more mainland TV series after she appeared on the stage of Sisters Riding the Winds and Breaking The Waves, making it far more likely that she will join the cast of yet another show.

According to Israeli military spokesman Daniel Hagari, the raid was focused on the Jenin refugee camp, and was ""not against the Palestinian Authority but against the terror groups in Jenin.""On Monday, UN Special Coordinator for the Middle East Peace Process Tor Wennesland tweeted that the current escalation in the occupied West Bank ""is very dangerous"" following months of mounting tensions.The operation ""once again reminds us of the extremely volatile and unpredictable situation across the occupied West Bank,"" he tweeted, urging that all must ensure the civilian population is protected.UN Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator in Palestine Lynn Hastings expressed ""alarm"" in a tweet and stressed that ""access to all injured must be ensured.""Arab League Secretary-General Ahmed Aboul-Gheit on Monday condemned the Israeli military raid on Jenin and called on peace advocates across the world to intervene immediately and stop the Israeli ""ominous and criminal"" operation.""The ongoing brutal Israeli military operation in Jenin is categorically slammed,"" Aboul-Gheit tweeted, noting that raiding cities and camps under air support as well as razing houses and roads are collective punishment and revenge that will only lead to further escalation of tension.The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the United Arab Emirates on Monday also expressed strong condemnation against the Israeli forces.In a statement, it called for an immediate halt to repeated and escalating campaigns against the Palestinian people, urging Israeli authorities to reduce escalation and avoid steps that ""exacerbate tension and violence in the occupied Palestinian territories and lead to a deterioration of the situation and perpetuation of the cycle of violence.""In a statement, the Egyptian Foreign Ministry condemned on Monday ""in the strongest terms"" the Israeli raid, voicing opposition to the repeated Israeli raids and incursions into Palestinian cities that killed civilians.Describing the Israeli attacks as a ""flagrant violation of international laws and legitimacy,"" the ministry warned against the serious impacts of the ongoing escalation which it said would exacerbate the Palestinians' sufferings and undermine Egyptian, regional, and international efforts to de-escalate tensions in the occupied territories.Jordan on Monday warned of the catastrophic consequences of the Israeli raid on Jenin, calling for the international community's intervention to stop Israel's military operations.Türkiye also strongly condemned the Israeli military operation, urging Israel to act with common sense and stop such actions.The Lebanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Emigrants on Monday condemned the Israeli aggression, which it said ""targets the entire population without distinction between civilians and combatants or between young people, children and the elderly.""The ministry called on the international community to pressure the ""aggressor"" to stop assaults and protect defenseless civilians.",PHOTO,WORLD,"Smoke rises during clashes between Palestinians and Israeli forces in the West Bank city of Jenin, on July 3, 2023.

Intl attention needed to solve the Palestinian question amid escalating violence,GT staff reporters,2023-07-04,"The international community must refocus their attention on the Palestinian question to collectively work toward helping the Middle East gain peace and stability, analysts reached by the Global Times said on Tuesday after Israel's recent large-scale attacks on Palestine.Palestine on Monday decided to stop all contacts, meetings and security coordination with the Israeli government in protest against the latter's brutal raids in the West Bank, the Xinhua News Agency reported Monday local time.     On Monday, the Israeli army, backed by armored vehicles, bulldozers, drones and helicopters, waged a large-scale military attack against the northern West Bank city of Jenin and the refugee camps there, according to XinhuaAt least eight Palestinians were killed and 80 others were injured during the raids, which Richard Hecht, an Israeli military spokesperson, said was an escalation unseen since 2006, according to media reports. The recent escalating situation in the Palestine-Israel conflict is just verifying what we have always been saying: The Palestine-Israel issue is the core of Middle East issues and the region cannot realize peace and stability unless the problem is solved, Li Weijian, a research fellow with the Institute for Foreign Policy Studies of the Shanghai Institutes for International Studies, told the Global Times. Li further emphasized that the solution to the problem seems to be even more urgent now given the wave of reconciliation in the region. He called on the international community to refocus attention on the issue. Since January, 24 people, most of them Israelis, have been killed in a series of attacks carried out by Palestinians, and 180 Palestinians, including children and women, were killed by Israeli soldiers and settlers, Xinhua reported citing official figures. Zhang Jun, China's permanent representative to the United Nations on June 27 called for efforts to break the cycle of violence between Israelis and Palestinians and strive for common security.It is important to break the cycle of violence. It is important to uphold the international rule of law and stop unilateral actions to change the status quo, and it is important to honor political commitments and advance the two-state solution, he told the UN Security Council, Xinhua reported.The continued conflict has deep and intricate historical, religious and ethnic causes. However, in terms of geopolitics, the West', especially the US' long-standing unfair Middle East policy, which has raised concerns within the international community, has created obstacles to addressing the conflict, according to Li. Israel heavily relies on the US, but the two allies have witnessed growing cracks in their relationship in recent years alongside significant changes in the regional situation, particularly after Saudi Arabia and Iran resumed relations with the help of China, explained Niu Xinchun, a research fellow at the China Institute of Contemporary International Relations in Beijing.After the successful mediation between Saudi Arabia and Iran, the international community expects China to continue playing a greater role in the Palestine-Israel issue. At the invitation of President Xi Jinping, President of the State of Palestine Mahmoud Abbas paid a state visit to China from June 13 to 16. During a meeting of the two leaders on June 14, Xi put forward a three-point proposal for the settlement of the Palestinian question. Xi stressed that the Palestinian question has remained unresolved for over half a century, causing great sufferings to the Palestinian people; justice must be done to Palestine as soon as possible.During his meeting with US lawmakers in Jerusalem last week, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu revealed that he was set to visit China next month. Although the planned trip has not been confirmed by Chinese authorities, analysts reached by the Global Times said they look forward to Netanyahu's visit and hoped the trip would play a role in helping promote peaceful solution to the Palestine-Israel.Some experts view Netanyahu's visit to China as an attempt to remind the US that Israel has other diplomatic options besides Washington. They noted that the world is transitioning from a unipolar world controlled by the hegemonic US to a multipolar world. The US' influence on others is declining and countries all around the world are stressing diplomatic independency, including Israel.  Obviously, the adjustment of Saudi Arabia's diplomatic strategy has inspired Israel. Netanyahu's planned visit to China is expected to not only strengthen China-Israel relations, but also potentially lead to progress in the establishment of diplomatic relations with Saudi Arabia as well as peace talks between Palestine and Israel, Niu told the Global Times on Tuesday.But Niu emphasized that recent events in the Middle East should not be viewed from the perspective of a zero-sum game. Whether it is the resumption of diplomatic relations between Saudi Arabia and Iran, peace talks between Palestine and Israel, or the possible establishment of diplomatic relations between Saudi Arabia and Israel in the future, no matter who mediates, it is conducive to peace in the Middle East and these efforts would be truly win-win and multi-win, he stressed.",Category one not found,Category two not found,"Palestinians run to take cover during clashes between Palestinians and Israeli forces in the West Bank city of Jenin, on July 3, 2023.

"China's popularity among Arab youths rises as Middle East enters post-US era, signifying increasing strategic autonomy in regional affairs: experts",Wan Hengyi,2023-06-27,"From the top to the grassroots, the Middle East has gradually entered a post-US era, which not only signifies the increasing strategic autonomy of regional countries in political and security affairs, but also indicates the rapid evolution of the regional order, and that a new landscape is gradually taking shape, experts noted as China has reportedly surpassed the US in popularity among Arab youths in this year's Arab Youth Survey.The promising prospects and opportunities presented by China's development, as well as the continuity and stability demonstrated in its domestic and foreign policies, have further strengthened the strategic choice of regional countries in the Middle East to look toward the East. This is particularly attractive among the younger generations, analysts remarked.China ranked second among all nations considered as friendly, compared with the US, which ranked seventh in the Arab Youth Survey conducted by Dubai-based public relations firm ASDA'A BCW, CNN reported. More than 80 percent of respondents consider China to be an ally of their country, according to the report.This year's survey, its 15th edition, included face-to-face interviews with nearly 3,600 residents aged 18 to 24 across 53 cities in 18 Arab countries.In response to the survey showing an increasing favorability toward China among younger generations in Arab countries, Mao Ning, a spokesperson for the Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson, said that Chinastand ready to work with Arab countries to continue enhancing youth exchange and cement the public foundation for building a China-Arab community with a shared future in the new era.The trust that the people in the Middle East, especially young people, in China is largely based on the tangible benefits and opportunities brought about by cooperation with China in the region, Liu Zhongmin, a professor at the Middle East Studies Institute of Shanghai International Studies University, told the Global Times on Tuesday.Earlier, the 10th Arab-China Business Conference was held in Riyadh, capital of Saudi Arabia, with more than 3,500 Chinese and Arab official and business representatives gathered at the major business conference, in which dozens of deals worth billions of dollars were inked.""In terms of areas of cooperation covered, this is all-round cooperation,"" Liu said, noting that in addition to traditional cooperation in energy, the two sides are also expanding cooperation in more areas such as technology. The deals include a $5.6 billion agreement between Saudi Arabia's Investment Ministry and Chinese carmaker Human Horizons for a joint venture and a $266 million deal signed by Saudi Arabia with Hong Kong-based Android developer Hibobi Technology for tourism and other apps, media reports showed. While both China and Arab countries are seeking to further boost win-win cooperation, the US is reportedly concerned about the deepening cooperation between Riyadh and Beijing in security and sensitive high-tech sectors. Just days before the Arab-China Business Conference, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken visited Saudi Arabia. He said that Washington was not asking anyone to choose between the US and China, but said the US ""remains the number one partner of choice"" for most countries in the Persian Gulf region.Liu stated that while US officials mostly avoid directly mentioning China, they are actually working to distance China from Arab countries. ""Saudi Arabia's response implies a rejection of Blinken's statement, which may also reflect the attitude of most countries in the region,"" he said.Behind the US' zero-sum attempt is also its strategic shift away from the Middle East to major power competition with Russia and China, while trying to cling onto its long-term presence in the Middle East. ""The US probably did not expect such a huge change in the Middle East this year, and it also has an unexpected and bewildered feeling about its own decline and the rise of other countries,"" the expert noted.Saudi Arabia and Iran announced the resumption of diplomatic ties with immediate effect in Beijing on April 6 after the first formal meeting between the two countries' top diplomats in more than seven years.Analysts noted that China's successful mediation between the two countries not only shows that that the diplomatic philosophy advocated and practiced by China is being recognized worldwide, but also has significant amplification and spillover effects.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is set to visit China next month, according to reports from the Times of Israel, quoting a source as saying that advanced contacts have been held in recent days between the two leaders' offices to arrange the visit. Although neither country has officially confirmed the news yet, reports suggest that Netanyahu will attempt to advance relations with Saudi Arabia with the help of China. However, this move may provoke discontent from Washington, which has been consistently urging normalization of relations between the two countries.The report quoted senior sources as describing Netanyahu's upcoming trip to China as ""breaking the frame,"" as the US has long held an important position in the Middle East, and Israel is one of the most important allies of the US in the region.Israel's response can be seen as a continuation of Saudi Arabia and Iran's announcement of the resumption of diplomatic ties in Beijing. This further indicates that the US is finding it increasingly difficult to exert the same level of dominance in the Middle East as it did in the past. More and more allies and partners of the US in the region are starting to make decisions based on their own national interests, said Tang Zhichao, a Middle East analyst at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.In the foreseeable future, the US' regional influence will continue to decline with the anticipation of a significant decrease in its willingness to engage in diplomatic efforts, intervene in conflicts, and reshape the order in the Middle East.

It will also serve as a reminder to the US that Israel has other diplomatic options than Washington, experts noted. The Israeli premier announced his China trip when he met with US lawmakers in Jerusalem on Tuesday.The visit has not been officially announced by Israel or China as of press time. However, Israeli local media said that Netanyahu's China visit comes at a time when ties between Israel and the US have suffered under the current government, with the Biden administration increasingly outspoken in its criticism of Israeli policies. US President Joe Biden has publicly kept Netanyahu at arm's length. In March, he said Netanyahu would not be invited in the near term, in the context of the swirling protests in Israel against the government's plans to remake the judiciary.Netanyahu's China visit would send the US a clear message that Israel could have multiple partners in different fields - having the US as its security partner and China as its political, trade and science and technology partner, Sun Degang, director of the Center for Middle Eastern Studies at Fudan University, told the Global Times on Wednesday, adding that despite Biden government's displeasure and opposition, Israel will not make concessions over its policies. Netanyahu's office said that Washington had been notified about the planned visit a month ago and insisted that ties with the US were at an ""all-time high,"" according to media reports. The wording shows that Israel considers its alliance with the US as an existing asset that it hopes to maintain, and its relations with China as an increment that it hopes to enhance, and the two are not contradictory, Sun said, noting that by showing a pro-US yet not anti-China stance, Israel is voicing its reluctance to serve as a US pawn in Washington's scheming to contain China. However, it would be an underestimation to think Netanyahu's upcoming trip is all about pressuring the US, experts point out. Ties between China and Israel have been warming over recent years, marked by cooperation especially in fields such as infrastructure and technology innovation. The US factor should not be considered as a deciding one in the development of China-Israel ties, Ding Long, a professor at the Middle East Research Institute of Shanghai International Studies University. The Middle East region is experiencing a major change after Saudi Arabia and Iran resumed relations with the help of China, and countries in the region have become increasingly engaged in a ""wave of reconciliation,"" Sun said. Israel would need to catch up with the trend and enhance its relations with China during the trip to achieve its own power rebalancing, he noted. Ding expects that during Netanyahu's visit, China would also persuade Israel to remove non-economic factors hindering China-Israel cooperation, such as US pressure to reject Chinese companies from participating in major infrastructure projects. Israel and China have seen warming relations and more interest in Israeli innovations, especially in medical tech, robotics, food tech and artificial intelligence, the Times of Israel said on Tuesday. Netanyahu's China visit would come following Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas' Beijing trip earlier in June. During Abbas' trip in Beijing, China put forward a three-point proposal for the settlement of the Palestinian question, according to the Xinhua News Agency.It proves that after brokering reconciliation between Saudi Arabia and Iran, China continues to show its determination to broker peace in the Middle East region, and addressing the Palestine-Israel conflict is high on the agenda to implement China's Global Security Initiative, Sun said. It is hard for the US that has a special alliance with Israel to win trust from Palestine. But China with a strategic partnership with Palestine and an innovative comprehensive partnership with Israel at the same time, would be more likely to play the role of a mediator upholding unbiased justice, Sun noted. ""Therefore, Netanyahu's China visit itself showed that China's peace efforts have been further consolidated in the Middle East region.""Zhang Jun, China's permanent representative to the United Nations on Wednesday called for efforts to break the cycle of violence between Israelis and Palestinians and strive for common security.It is important to break the cycle of violence. It is important to uphold the international rule of law and stop unilateral actions to change the status quo, and it is important to honor political commitments and advance the two-state solution, he told the Security Council, Xinhua reported.It is alarming that some US politicians hold China's peace efforts to blame for Washington's waning influence in the Middle East region, analysts said. China and the US have great room for cooperation and share a great deal of common interests on topics such as the Palestine-Israel question, and their interaction should not be defined as a zero-sum game.",CHINA,DIPLOMACY,Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu Photo: VCG,"Reporter, Beijing",Global Times reporter tracking China's space programs and cutting-edge science and technology projects.,28,839,<FreqDist with 17 samples and 492 outcomes>

"Kashgar blends multi-ethnic culture, facilitates Eurasian commerce",Xinhua,2023-06-24,"Ostangboyi, a teahouse nestled in the old town area of Kashgar City in northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, has become a beloved gathering place for neighbors, locals and merchants alike.Here, amid the winding streets and ancient architecture, they can savor a cup of tea, engage in lively conversations and immerse themselves in the timeless beauty of their surroundings.""With over a hundred years of history, the art of tea brewing may have evolved, but people's enduring passion for tea remains unwavering,"" said Memetkerim Memet, the teahouse's manager.The rich heritage of Kashgar came alive as tea from south of the Yangtze River found its way to the western region of Xinjiang along the ancient Silk Road, integrating seamlessly into the lives of the locals.In ancient times, Kashgar served as a vital transportation hub, connecting China with Central Asia and South Asia, said Xiao Xiaoyong, a professor at the Minzu University of China, adding that the confluence of diverse ethnic cultures in this region has given rise to a wealth of historical and cultural treasures.Today, Kashgar has harnessed its cultural and geographical advantages, transforming into a unique tourist destination that blends history and modernity. Through favorable policies, improved infrastructure, and the promotion of cross-border exchanges, the city has also emerged as a catalyst for Eurasian commerce.WHERE HISTORY MEETS MODERNITYOn the second-floor balcony of the teahouse, people joyfully sway to the enchanting melodies of the rawap, a stringed instrument, and the rhythmic beats of tambourines.However, this place may not have always been as welcoming to tourists in the past.""Houses in the old town were predominantly constructed using brick and wood structures. They lacked resilience against earthquakes and faced potential dangers, such as walls vulnerable to flood damage and limitations in fire rescue capabilities,"" said Memet Usman, father of Memetkerim Memet and the teahouse's former manager.In 2010, a project was initiated with an investment of over 7 billion yuan (about 975 million U.S. dollars) to revamp the dilapidated houses. It involved a population of more than 200,000 people and an area of 8 square km in the old town. As a result, more than 7,000 traditional dwellings of historical and cultural significance were repaired and reinforced while preserving their original spatial patterns.""The measures taken by the Chinese government to transform the old town of Kashgar are admirable,"" said Mohanad A.A. Alaklouk, permanent representative of Palestine to the Arab League, during his visit as a delegate of diplomats and officials from the Arab League and its Secretariat in May.""This transformation has not only brought great changes to the residents' living environment and conditions, but more importantly, has preserved the local cultural characteristics,"" said Alaklouk.Beyond the tangible architectural rejuvenation, Kashgar cherishes its intangible cultural heritage.Zulpukar Ababakri is an inheritor of the Kashgar pottery tradition, which produces both household items and ornaments.""For thousands of years, despite the evolution and innovation in earthenware techniques, the patterns of clouds, peaches, roses and grapes -- symbolizing fortune, good health and happiness in Chinese culture -- have remained intact and continue to captivate the multi-ethnic community of Kashgar,"" Zulpukar Ababakri said.Kashgar not only celebrates its indigenous culture but also embraces the world with open arms.Hadiya Msham Abulla, a student from Tanzania who studied medicine in China, is now married to her Uygur husband Dilshat Tursun. The couple started running a coffee shop in the old town of Kashgar this year.Through live streams and online platforms, they share their stories and products with a global audience.""The ancient city of Kashgar is a place of passion and fantasy. Despite living in a foreign land, I sense the feeling of home from the hospitable people,"" she said.According to the Culture, Radio, Television, and Tourism Bureau of the Kashgar Prefecture, the region welcomed over 11 million tourists in the first five months of 2023, marking an 83.48 percent increase year on year, and resulting in tourism revenue of nearly 8.6 billion yuan, up 114.7 percent.PASSAGE TO EURASIAEarlier this month, 25 trucks loaded with containers departed from Kashgar. After arriving at the railway station of the city of Osh in Kyrgyzstan, containers were transferred onto trains bound for Tashkent, the capital of Uzbekistan.It was a trial run for Kashgar to facilitate cross-border trade through the implementation of multimodal transport systems, ahead of the launch of the China-Kyrgyzstan-Uzbekistan railway.""Kashgar is a passage connecting China to Central Asia, South Asia, West Asia, and even Europe. We are dedicated to providing support in streamlining customs clearance for foreign trade enterprises and ensuring the stability of industrial chains and supply chains,"" said Cao Hongjian of Kashgar Customs.Kashgar has emerged as an attractive destination for enterprises seeking to capitalize on its key location. One such enterprise is Zhongshun E-commerce Co., Ltd., a foreign trade company established in Kashgar's comprehensive bonded zone in 2020.""We collect goods from the Yangtze River Delta and Pearl River Delta and gather them in Kashgar, before dispatching them to Central Asia, Europe and other places. Presently, we process over 120,000 e-commerce orders daily,"" said Zhang Qi, the general manager of Zhongshun.Ma Haitao, director of the zone's management committee, said that there are currently over 350 registered enterprises in the zone, including more than 280 trade and logistics companies and nearly 40 ones for manufacturing and processing.In 2022, the value of cross-border e-commerce in the zone reached 1.29 billion yuan, up 291 percent year on year.""With the development of cross-border e-commerce, general trade and processing trade with a longer value chain have also started to release their growth potential,"" said Ma.

Tactical progress needed for Team China to be competitive,Global Times,2023-06-20,"Another win! The Chinese men's national football team bounced back from being winless in March to two consecutive wins in June since Serbian coach Aleksandar Jankovic took charge in February. However, the achievement is not something to be very proud of. The national team's 2-0 win over the Palestine team on Tuesday following a 4-0 triumph over Myanmar on Friday at the newly unveiled Suoyuwan Stadium in Dalian, Northeast China's Liaoning Province, do not indicate the teams' dominance in tactics like the scoreboard shows, as their lead was earned mainly through physical advantages rather than tactical superiority. Consider the rankings of the opponents: Myanmar are sitting in the 160th place in the FIFA world ranking, while the Palestine team is at 92rd. China, ranked 81st worldwide and 11th in Asia, just won the games against Asian minnows. When facing New Zealand in March, who are 100th placed in the world, China ended their trip to the Down Under with a draw and a defeat. That means Team China is likely to face challenges again when playing against teams who are tactically stronger.Critics argue that the national team's recent successes against weaker teams should not overshadow their underlying weaknesses. The true test lies in their ability to outplay more formidable opponents and make significant strides in their technical and tactical prowess. For sure, to secure a berth in the next group stage of the Asian Cup and progress to the next round of World Cup Asian qualifiers, the national team needs to ensure they are able to defeat teams like Myanmar and Palestine. Treating the matches against Asian football minnows as chances to fine-tune their gameplay and explore different tactical approaches might be helpful for the national team, but a big change is yet to happen. As the world football continues to evolve, the opportunities to face weaker opponents are dwindling. Now, the national team is in a precarious position. Wu Lei remains the biggest scoring power for the national team as he scored three goals in the latest two friendlies for the national team. The former RCD Espanyol player is the only player in the team who had a long stint with a club that is competing in top-tier leagues in Europe. He is now 32. Nurturing young talents at this stage would be a bit late as the young Chinese players lack international experiences while the national team has a limited schedule for friendlies. To maintain China's position in the FIFA rankings, the national team even turned down an invitation to play against the 2022 FIFA World Cup winners Argentina this month, an opportunity that many other teams envy. From the perspective of the Chinese Football Association (CFA), the national team needed a series of victories to emerge from the gloom of recent years. Many had worried that the anti-graft campaign that has seen nearly a dozen officials from the CFA being put under disciplinary investigations would be a serious distraction for the national team players. Jankovic is supposed to lead the Chinese national team at the Asian Cup at the beginning of 2024 and the 2026 FIFA World Cup qualifiers which will start in October. In the upcoming Asian Cup early next year, China will face the defending Asian Cup champions and hosts Qatar (ranked 61st in the world), as well as Lebanon (99) and Tajikistan (109). Chinese football fans eagerly await signs of improvement from the national team. They yearn for a team that can compete at the highest level, inspire the younger generation, and restore pride to Chinese football. China's best Asian Cup finish was the runners-up in 2004 when they were playing on home soil. China had a chance to play on home turfs again this year, but the CFA gave away the hosting rights of the 2023 Asian Cup last year due to COVID-19 pandemic. Some promising signs from the young players do exist. The national under-24 team defeated their South Korean counterparts 1-0 in Jinhua, East China's Zhejiang Province, on Monday, thanks to a goal from 23-year-old Sun Qinhan. The two teams were playing friendlies in preparation for the football competitions at the Asian Games, where the South Korean side are considered a hot favorite. Famed Italian coach Marcello Lippi had led the team to a mini revival both tactically and morally during his tenure from 2017 to 2020 with the national team. However, the progress did not last long due to the mismanagement of the CFA. For Jankovic, who does not possess the reputation of Lippi, the pressure and expectation might be low. There is a long way to go for the national team to progress. But never underestimate those who are brave enough to take the ""hot potato"" reins of the Chinese national team. There is still time for him to learn better about the Chinese players who are mainly playing in the domestic Chinese Super League and develop a national squad that can adapt to different game scenarios.",ARTS,CULTURE & LEISURE,Illustration: Chen Xia/Global Times,Author details not found,Author details not found,35,801,<FreqDist with 19 samples and 458 outcomes>

Large numbers of explosive devices were hurled at the forces. The forces responded with live fire,"" the Israeli army and the Border Police said in a joint statement.Abu Rudeineh added that the current situation cannot continue, and the international community and the U.S. administration in particular, ""must intervene immediately"" to stop the Israelis.The spokesman held the Israeli government fully responsible ""for thwarting all Arab and international efforts that have been made recently to prevent escalation and tension.""""The aggressive Israeli actions against our people will not discourage them from continuing their legitimate struggle until they realize their aspirations for liberation and the establishment of their independent state with East Jerusalem as its capital,"" he said.",PHOTO,WORLD,"A Palestinian protester holds a flag during a protest against the killing of five Palestinians near the fence of the Gaza-Israel border, east of Gaza City, on June 19, 2023.(Photo: Xinhua)",Author details not found,Author details not found,16,396,<FreqDist with 15 samples and 228 outcomes>
Dubai Chamber of Digital Economy launches report on 'Dubai’s Venture Capital Ecosystem',WAM,2023-06-20,"Dubai Chamber of Digital Economy, one of the three chambers operating under Dubai Chambers, has launched its third report on Dubai’s digital economy. The “Dubai's Venture Capital Ecosystem” report provides an overview of the investor landscape backing the start-ups and scale-ups that are transforming Dubai and the MENA region.Commenting on the release of the report, Omar bin Sultan Al Olama, Minister of State for Artificial Intelligence, Digital Economy, and Remote Work Applications and Chairman of Dubai Chamber of Digital Economy, said, “The UAE’s advanced digital ecosystem has accelerated the development of the entrepreneurship sector and contributed to significant growth in its activity. The country’s proactive vision in developing legislation and initiatives in the digital field creates a favorable environment for startups and fast-growing companies, which has attracted unicorn companies and investors from around the world and consolidated the UAE's position as a global hub for the digital economy.”Al Olama added, “The results in the report reflect our long-term commitment to developing smart digital solutions and deploying these to build a new and future-facing model for the economic sector in the UAE, and Dubai in particular, and underline the emirate’s position as a global capital for the future economy.”As Dubai sets its sights on becoming the global destination of choice for digital entrepreneurs, Dubai Chamber of Digital Economy is tasked with attracting leading tech companies, start-ups and scale-ups that can support Dubai’s digital ambitions. The chamber was created to build the world’s best digital infrastructure and transform Dubai into an international technology hub.With a series of visionary initiatives and investments in cutting-edge technology, Dubai is well on its way to achieving its ambitions. From its world-class fiberoptic network and cloud-based systems to its innovative approaches to smart city development, Dubai has set the standard for how cities can leverage technology to enhance the lives of its citizens and attract global businesses.Just one recent example is the opening of the Moro Hub in February 2023, world’s largest solar-powered data centre. The 100-MW facility is a Dubai 10X initiative, which is an innovative program launched by H.H. Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum in 2017. The initiative entails government entities creating disruptive, exponential change, placing Dubai 10 years ahead of leading global cities.According to the report, a total of 749 scale-ups across the MENA region (excluding Israel), have raised a total of over US$19.5 billion cumulatively over the past decade (2012-2022), with UAE scaleups accounting for 65 percent of total cumulative capital raised across the region.Today, Dubai is home to over 40 percent of the MENA region’s scale-ups, with 306 scale-ups calling the emirate home. Dubai still accounts for over 90 percent of all scale-ups in the country, which is home to 338 scale-ups in total.Dubai’s 306 scale-ups have raised over US$11.7 billion in funding over the course of the past decade, which represents an impressive 60 percent of the MENA region’s total cumulative fundraising total. In addition, in 2022, Dubai-based startups doubled-down on their prior year results, fundraising over US$2 billion.In addition, the growth of funding in the MENA region has exceeded US$4 billion in 2021 and 2022 and the number of mega-rounds of US$300 million or more has seen an increasing trend with three seen in 2021 and six in 2022, including two scaleups listing on stock exchanges.In 2022, there was a significant shift in the number of funding rounds, where scale-ups raised funding, and a trend towards larger cheque sizes and funding bracket gained momentum. In the US$100 million to US$1 billion range, funding rounds increased by more than 100 percent between 2021 and 2022. Other funding ranges also saw increases between 20 percent to 87 percent.Considering the source of capital raise, venture capital and corporate rounds accounted for over three quarters of the capital raised, while IPOs and ICOs accounted for nearly equal share.The number of scaleups have also increased considerably, in Dubai, growing 26 percent between 2021 and 2022. In terms of absolute numbers, Dubai saw an increase of 64 scale-ups between 2021 and 2022 growing from 242 to 306 scale-ups.Venture funding in Dubai has seen tremendous growth in the past decade. From a time of only seed stage and earlier rounds, Dubai has grown to become the only city in the MENA region to be home to startups to raise funds in Series E and Series F rounds.The report, which was produced in collaboration with Entrepreneur Middle East, reveals that more than 30 percent of the funding rounds are attributed to startups headquartered in Dubai, implying 87 percent of all funding rounds for UAE-based companies are for firms headquartered in the emirate.By 2031, the national digital economy is expected to be conservatively valued at well over US$140 billion (from today’s US$38 billion). Together with Dubai Chamber of Digital Economy, it is the collaboration between stakeholders and ecosystem players that will ensure that Dubai becomes the next digital economy capital of the world.",WORLD,ASIA-PACIFIC,Picture description not found,Author details not found,Author details not found,33,753,<FreqDist with 14 samples and 434 outcomes>

"China, Palestine to facilitate negotiations on free trade agreement",Yin Yeping,2023-06-15,"China and Palestine have pledged to facilitate negotiations on a bilateral free trade agreement (FTA) while promoting the upgrading of trade and investment cooperation to a new level, Chinese Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM) spokesperson Shu Jueting said on Thursday.China and Palestine issued a joint statement on the establishment of a strategic partnership on Wednesday during Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas' state visit to China.Speaking at a regular press conference, the MOFCOM spokesperson said that the two heads of state announced the establishment of a China-Palestine strategic partnership to comprehensively promote friendly cooperation in various fields and chart the course for the future development of China-Palestine relations and economic and trade cooperation.The MOFCOM will continue to closely collaborate with the relevant departments of Palestine to effectively implement the important consensus reached by the leaders of both countries, Shu said.Both sides will continue to leverage the role of the China-Palestine Joint Economic and Trade Committee to build more consensuses on economic and trade cooperation, she said, noting that ""we are willing to expedite the negotiation process of the China-Palestine FTA and promote the upgrading of bilateral trade and investment cooperation.""China welcomes Palestine's participation in trade fairs such as the China International Import Expo and the China-Arab States Expo, where Palestine's business environment and distinctive products can be promoted, the spokesperson said.China is also willing to continue implementing projects that contribute to Palestine's economic development and the improvement of people's livelihoods based on Palestinian needs, which Shu said will continually inject new momentum and make new contributions to the development of the China-Palestine strategic partnership.President Mahmoud Abbas is the first Arab head of state received by China this year, which fully demonstrates the great importance he attaches to China-Palestine relations and strengthening solidarity and cooperation with Arab countries, Li Shaoxian, director of the China-Arab Research Institute at Ningxia University, told the Global Times on Thursday.""We are a major importer of Palestine's goods, and some key Palestine's exports, mainly agricultural products, find foothold in the Chinese market,"" Li said, indicating the strong trade ties.The strong economic and trade relationship is based on mutual trust and respect, the expert said.""There is no problem in China-Palestine relations. Palestine has always upheld our core interests, and we have always firmly supported the just cause of the Palestinian people to restore their legitimate national rights,"" Li said.China has always been a strong supporter and provided humanitarian and development aid to Palestine, and it has successively implemented and completed more than 30 aid projects such as Gaza secondary school, Gaza coastal road and the Ramallah road construction project.During the COVID-19 pandemic, China provided Palestine with a large amount of anti-epidemic materials, sent a medical expert team and organized video exchanges between health experts and Palestine.China donated 100,000 doses of the COVID-19 vaccine to Palestine, and jointly donated 500,000 doses of vaccine to the Gaza Strip with Egypt.In December 2022, the Chinese government and the Palestinian government signed a memorandum of understanding on Belt and Road Initiative cooperation, which brings even more benefits to the people of both countries.In addition to donations and support, economic and trade exchanges are an unavoidable topic between China and Palestine. In 2022, bilateral trade reached $158 million, a year-on-year increase of more than 23 percent.",SOURCE,ECONOMY,National flags of China and the State of Palestine Photo: VCG,Author details not found,Author details not found,18,511,<FreqDist with 13 samples and 309 outcomes>
"China to cement ties with Palestine, ‘play greater role to mediate Palestine-Israel conflict’",Yang Sheng,2023-06-13,"President of the State of Palestine Mahmoud Abbas arrived in Beijing on Tuesday, starting a four-day state visit to China.Experts said it will be a great chance for China and Palestine to promote their traditional friendship to new heights and for China to put more efforts into promoting peace and stability in the region under the guidance of the Global Security Initiative (GSI) proposed by President Xi Jinping and by improving regional development. In past decades, more and more regional countries find that US policy on Middle East issues, including the Palestine-Israel conflict, the Iranian nuclear deal and the Syria crisis, is unreliable and unsustainable. Not only has the US failed to solve regional problems to bring peace and development to the region, but it has added more tensions and chaos, which is causing regional countries to lose faith in the US and expect China to play a greater role in promoting peace, stability and development in the region, analysts said.Good old friendCalling Abbas an ""old and good friend"" of the Chinese people, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin noted that the Palestinian president would be the first Arab head of state to be hosted by China this year. China-Palestine relations have maintained a good momentum of growth with stronger political mutual trust and deeper friendship between the two peoples, Wang said at the regular press briefing on Friday. China is one of the first countries to recognize the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) and the State of Palestine. In May 1965, the PLO set up an office that was treated as a diplomatic mission in Beijing, and in November 1988, China formally established diplomatic ties with Palestine, according to the website of the Chinese Foreign Ministry.Wu Sike, former special envoy of the Chinese Government on Middle East issues, told the Global Times on Tuesday that ""This year marks the 35th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Palestine. Abbas' visit is of special significance to bilateral relations."" The Middle East is undergoing significant changes, and this is a special period. Now Saudi Arabia and Iran have entered a process of reconciliation with help from China. This has led to a wave of reconciliation in this region among different countries, Wu said. With this important background, the world, especially Middle East countries, is paying attention to whether such reconciliation will promote the settlement of the long-standing and complicated Palestinian question, Wu noted. Tunc Akkoc, editor in chief of Harici Media in Turkey, echoed the view of Chinese analysts as he told the Global Times on Tuesday that ""As a matter of fact, China's mediation efforts in the Middle East have begun to pay off.""Li Haidong, a professor at the Institute of International Relations at the China Foreign Affairs University, told the Global Times on Tuesday that in the past, when Saudi Arabia and Iran were confronting each other, they backed different forces within Palestine, so that the disunity within Palestine was a serious problem that impacted the solution of Palestine-Israel conflict, but now, with the Saudi-Iran reconciliation, this problem will be gone.Palestine-Israel issueWhile China makes efforts to promote peace in the region, the US seems jealous and worried, as Washington is concerned that ""Beijing is expanding its influence"" in the region where the US has been the main power broker for decades, said some media in the Middle East.The Times of Israel said in a report on Tuesday that ""Beijing has sought to boost its ties to the Middle East, challenging long-standing US influence there - efforts that have sparked unease in Washington.""  ""In fact, it is the US that cares most about its own influence and hegemony when intervening in Middle East affairs. The US might not want to see regional conflicts totally losing control, but it also tries to keep those conflicts from a peaceful solution, so it always plays the game of 'divide and rule' to push confrontations between blocs, and to force regional countries to fight against each other,"" Li said.China's efforts will provide hope for regional countries to change this situation and also the hope of realizing sustainable peace and security, Li said.Qiu Wenping, an expert on Middle East studies and a professor at Fudan University, said ""the foundation of US strategy on Middle East is to use the US-Israel-Saudi alliance to confront Iran, and China's mediation on Saudi-Iran ties breaks the foundation of US strategy."" Wu said that by communicating with Israeli think tanks and some other groups in the past, we found that there are rational people and thinkers within Israel who believe that Israel cannot realize sustainable peace by only solving the problems with the use of force. A long-term and sustainable peace that serves the fundamental interests of Israel needs to be realized via a political solution with Palestinians. China's constructive role In April, Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Qin Gang told his Palestinian counterpart that China is willing to aid peace negotiations. Qin said China supports the resumption of peace talks between Palestine and Israel as soon as possible on the basis of the ""two-state solution,"" and is willing to play an active role in this regard.Chinese Foreign Spokesperson Wang Wenbin said at a press conference on Friday that the Palestinian question is at the heart of the Middle East issue and matters to the region's peace and stability and global equity and justice. China has all along firmly supported the Palestinian people's just cause of restoring their legitimate national rights. As a permanent member of the UN Security Council, China will continue to work with the international community for a comprehensive, just and enduring solution to the Palestinian question at an early date, said Wang.Akkoc from Turkey, who is also an observer on the Middle East issues, said ""China's peace plans that offer non-imposing and fair options are very meaningful,"" and ""the so-called 'Deal of the Century' plan by the US under the Trump administration is a text agreed between the US and Israel and based on the unconditional surrender of the Palestinians. It is clear that these impositions were not effective nor were accepted by the Palestinians, and further fueled the conflict, Akkoc said. ""Therefore, it is very important that China presents solutions and plans that take into account the interests of the relevant parties fairly, listens to the parties and feeds on their demands rather than imposing on them,"" he told the Global Times.In addition, internal US politics will bring high uncertainty if Middle East countries rely too much on Washington to find solutions to regional problems, because if conservative US political forces led by Donald Trump return to power after the presidential election next year, Washington's policy will show a U-turn compared to the Biden administration and this will certainly affect everyone, analysts said.",CHINA,DIPLOMACY,National flags of China and the State of Palestine Photo: VCG,"Reporter, Beijing","Yang Sheng is a chief reporter at the Global Times covering Chinese politics, diplomacy and military.",33,1103,<FreqDist with 16 samples and 625 outcomes>
Global Security Initiative provides greater room for imagination in peace between Palestine and Israel: Global Times editorial,Global Times,2023-06-13,"At the invitation of Chinese President Xi Jinping, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas is paying a state visit to China from Tuesday to Friday. As an old and good friend of the Chinese people, this is President Abbas' fifth visit to China, and he is also the first Arab head of state hosted by China this year. It is widely believed that the traditional friendly relations between China and Palestine will reach a new level. In addition to bilateral cooperation, the Palestinian issue is expected to be one of the topics discussed by the two heads of state. Against the backdrop of a wave of reconciliation in the Middle East, there is great anticipation for whether this visit will bring more hope for peace in the region.According to the Palestinian side, Abbas' visit will focus on the ""Arab Peace Initiative,"" and China is expected to continue playing a greater role in the Palestine-Israel issue. It is well known that China has been tirelessly advocating for the early achievement of a comprehensive, just, and lasting solution to the Palestinian question for many years. China has put forward its own proposals and expressed its welcome to negotiators from both sides of Palestine and Israel to hold direct talks in China. The handshake between Saudi Arabia and Iran, the ""arch-rivals"" in the Middle East, in Beijing showed the world the great appeal of the Global Security Initiative. After that, people have more room for imagination on whether the Palestinian issue has new approaches for resolution and whether Palestine and Israel will break the assertion that ""the willingness and ability to reach a historic compromise are almost zero.""The Palestinian issue is the core of the Middle East issue, and it is related to the peace and stability of the region and international fairness and justice. From World War II to the Cold War, and then to the 21st century, Middle East has experienced multiple wars and countless conflicts. The casualties and humanitarian crises caused have been shocking. It is worrisome that the peace process between Palestine and Israel has been stagnant since peace talks broke off in 2014, and the ""Quartet mechanism"" composed of the United Nations, the US, Russia, and the European Union has existed in name only in recent years. In May 2021, the largest-scale armed conflict since 2014 broke out between Palestine and Israel, resulting in the deaths of over 200 Palestinians, including dozens of children, and at least 12 deaths on the Israeli side, including two children. Violence also erupted between Palestine and Israel in April and May this year. To effectively accelerate the Palestine-Israel peace process tests and verifies international conscience and morality.We all know that Washington often talks about justice and human rights and loves to stand on the moral high ground to accuse others, but it is deeply culpable in the Palestinian issue.As a superpower, the US has played a very negative role in the Palestinian issue. It not only repeatedly obstructed the UN Security Council from speaking out on this issue, but also strongly favored one side, exacerbating the conflict. The Middle East peace plan proposed during Trump's term was even considered as ""a mark of shame"" rather than an agreement. A recent poll showed that 80 percent of Palestinians welcome Chinese offer to mediate in the Palestine-Israel conflict, while the US is seen as the least favorite option, which shows the public champions justice.We also noticed that some American media, while showing little interest in the Palestinian issue, viewed Abbas's visit to China through the lens of ""US-China competition,"" claiming that the trip signaled China's ""broader diplomatic ambitions"" in the Middle East and trying to portray it as part of ""US-China confrontation."" This argument is not only narrow-minded and short-sighted, but also shows that in the eyes of American elites, this major event concerning peace, stability, fairness and justice is just a tool for competition. If some American elites feel that they are ""powerless"" in the Middle East today, it is obviously due to their own policy problems, not related to China.Just as other security issues in the Middle East, China has no self-interest in the Palestinian issue and is making efforts to prevent the Palestinian issue being marginalized in the complicated and changing regional and international situations and promote the resolution of the issue with a sense of justice. President Xi Jinping put forward China's ""four-point proposal"" for resolving the Palestinian issue during his meetings with President Abbas on May 6, 2013 and July 18, 2017. After the clash between Palestine and Israel broke out in 2021, China, holding the rotating presidency of the UN Security Council, pushed the Security Council to hold five meetings on the Palestinian issue and ultimately issued a presidential statement. In addition, China also proposed three routes to implement the ""two-state solution,"" and held a seminar for peace activists from Palestine and Israel. So far, five Chinese special envoys to the Middle East have visited Palestine, Israel, Egypt, Jordan and other related countries in the region to mediate the Palestinian-Israeli conflict.Palestine and Israel are neighbors that cannot be moved away from each other. There are no winners in conflicts, and no losers in peace. China's sense of responsibility and morality in maintaining world peace and development is evident to the international community. This is also the reason why China can always make friends in the Middle East and around the world. People see that whether it is Saudi Arabia and Iran, Russia and Ukraine, Palestine and Israel, these countries who are against each other, are both China's partners and friends. This is fundamentally the result of China's diplomatic goal of building a community with a shared future for mankind, and it will further promote the concept of ""shared destiny"" to yield fruits in more places. We also expect President Abbas' visit to bring more good news for peace to the Middle East.",OPINION,EDITORIAL,Illustration: Chen Xia/GT,Author details not found,Author details not found,37,953,<FreqDist with 18 samples and 521 outcomes>
"China, Palestine upgrade ties to ‘milestone’ strategic partnership",GT staff reporters,2023-06-14,"China and Palestine on Wednesday upgraded their bilateral relations to a strategic partnership under the witness of Chinese President Xi Jinping and visiting Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas. Xi stressed that China and Palestine are good friends and good partners who trust and support each other. China was one of the first countries to recognize the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) and the State of Palestine, and has all along firmly supported the Palestinian people's just cause of restoring their legitimate national rights, Xi said.Facing unprecedented changes in the world and the new developments in the Middle East, China stands ready to strengthen coordination and cooperation with Palestine, and work for a comprehensive, just and durable solution to the Palestinian question at an early date, Xi noted. Analysts said the significant meeting not only reaffirms the China-Palestine traditional friendship based on mutual trust and support, but also heralds China's continuous commitment to addressing the Palestine-Israel conflict, which has been marginalized against the backdrop of major changes and turbulence in the global landscape despite recent mounting tension, analysts said on Wednesday.Analysts believe that China, with a consistent and just stance, will continue playing a constructive role in promoting reconciliation in the Middle East, and they said that the China-proposed Global Security Initiative (GSI) is winning wider support and yielding more fruits in the region and worldwide. Long-term friends Noting that President Abbas is the first Arab head of state hosted by China this year, Xi said on Wednesday the visit speaks volumes about the strength of China-Palestine relations.The upgrading of relations will serve as an important milestone in China-Palestine relations that builds on past achievements and heralds a brighter future. China will seize this opportunity to work with Palestine to advance bilateral friendship and cooperation in all areas, Xi said. Since the establishment of bilateral diplomatic relations in 1988, China has always assisted within its capacity with Palestine's economic development and improving people's livelihoods. China aided Palestine in the construction of more than 40 projects including schools and roads, sent expert teams, medical supplies and vaccines during the COVID-19 pandemic, and in June 2023, China pledged a further $1 million donation to the Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East. In a joint statement on the upgrade of bilateral relations issued on Wednesday, the two sides reiterated mutual support on issues of core interests and key concerns.Palestine upholds the one-China principle and supports all efforts made by the Chinese government to achieve national reunification… and condemns external interference in China's internal affairs including Hong Kong and Xinjiang-related affairs. China supports Palestine to become a full member of the UN and to resume peace talks with Israel on the basis of the principle of ""land for peace,"" relevant UN resolutions, and the ""two-state solution"" to achieve peaceful coexistence between Palestine and Israel.    The two sides vowed to actively promote negotiations on free trade agreements and enhance exchanges on culture, education and media. China will continue to provide humanitarian assistance to Palestine and support its livelihood and development projects and it will continue to provide personnel training and help with Palestine's capacity building, read the joint statement. Rong Ying, vice president of the China Institute of International Studies, told the Global Times on Wednesday that the upgrade in bilateral relations can usher in more potential for bilateral cooperation, thereby enhancing Palestine's development and international presence. China believes development can solve many security challenges in a sustainable way. China's approach to mediation heralds China's security and development outlook and its commitment to common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security in the region, Rong said. China approach Xi, during the Wednesday meeting with Abbas, put forward a three-point proposal for the settlement of the Palestinian question.First, the fundamental solution lies in the establishment of an independent state of Palestine that enjoys full sovereignty on the basis of the 1967 borders and with east Jerusalem as its capital. Second, Palestine's economic and livelihood needs should be met. Third, it is important to keep to the right direction of peace talks.A large-scale, more authoritative and more influential international peace conference should be convened to create conditions for the resumption of peace talks and contribute tangible efforts to help Palestine and Israel live in peace, Xi said. When the Palestine question is being marginalized from the spotlight amid major turbulence in the global landscape, China has assumed the responsibility of a major power to continuously mediate the conflict. It maintains a consistent stance and moves forward step by step, Rong noted. Ding Long, a professor at the Middle East Research Institute of Shanghai Foreign Studies University, told the Global Times Wednesday that China's consistent stance, in contrast to certain major countries' vacillating and partial positions, is the foundation of the high-level mutual trust between China and Palestine. Wu Sike, former special envoy of the Chinese government on Middle East issues, noted on Wednesday that when mediating the conflict, China not only thinks from a bilateral perspective, but also cares for lasting stability in the region and acts out of international justice. Long-term stability serves Israel's interests because even if it can maintain an advantageous status for a while, as long as Palestine's concerns are not addressed, conflicts will flare up every so often, jeopardizing Israel's security and development, Wu told the Global Times. China's role and efforts have been recognized, as a recent poll showed that 80 percent of Palestinians welcome Chinese offers to mediate in the Palestine-Israel conflict, while the US is seen as the least favorite option. The US, having been a broker in the Middle East for decades, cares most about its own influence and hegemony in the region, analysts said, citing the US' ""lip service"" support for the ""two-state solution"" and Trump administration's ""Deal of the Century"" plan based on the unconditional surrender of the Palestinians.US partiality toward Israel has eroded its capability of communicating with Palestine while its policy flips-and-flops between different administrations have also frustrated the international community, they noted.Li Weijian, vice president of the Chinese Association of Middle East Studies, told the Global Times that China's mediation does not aim to immediately solve the issue, as it is far more profound and complicated than that between Saudi Arabia and Iran. The immediate goal is to bring the topic back to the spotlight, de-escalate tensions and end hostilities in order to push forward the resumption of peace talks that have been stalled since 2014. Since China seeks no exclusive interests in the region, the US, if it is willing to do so, can also join the global efforts with its special ties with Israel, Li said. Abbas Zaki, a Palestinian Fatah Central Committee member and commissioner for relations with Arab countries and China, told Xinhua in a Monday interview the Iran-Saudi Arabia rapprochement signaled a change in the political landscape in the Middle East and raised awareness of unity and independence among regional countriesWhen the Middle East is shifting its priority from geopolitics to development, China's GSI, intertwined with Global Development Initiative and Global Civilization Initiative, is understood by more and getting wider support, Rong said.

Giving SCO cold shoulder not a wise strategic decision for India,Long Xingchun and Wang Geyan,2023-06-13," The 22nd summit of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) Council of Heads of State hosted by India will be held in the virtual format on July 4. After being held online from 2020 to 2021 because of the COVID-19 pandemic, the SCO summit resumed its in-person form in 2022, with the SCO foreign and defense ministers having already met each other face-to-face in India. India's sudden announcement on May 30 that the SCO Heads of State meeting will be held in the virtual format without explaining the reasons has surprised and puzzled the international community.Moreover, after New Delhi's announcement, some voices in India started to analyze why the SCO summit has turned virtual. Some believe it is ""due to its structural flaws,"" claiming that ""the SCO is a gathering of nations mostly tied closely to China and Russia."" ""By moving the SCO summit to a virtual mode, India is sending out a message that groupings dominated by China are no longer New Delhi's priority,"" argues a retired major general of the Indian Army, who thinks this also sends a signal that India's priority is the G20.There is no doubt that the G20, which is consisted of the world's most important economies, carries more weight than the SCO. However, the two groupings are not contradictory, and India is, for sure, not choosing one over the other. As a major country, India is well-positioned to host multiple multilateral summits in one year. Moreover, in recent years, India has actively engaged in multilateral diplomatic mechanisms to expand its international influence and increase its global presence. This includes many minilateral mechanisms, such as BRICS, the Quad, IBSA Dialogue Forum (India, Brazil and South Africa), the India-Central Asia Summit, and the I2U2 Group (US, India, Israel and UAE).On the other hand, the SCO, since its establishment, has achieved fruitful cooperation results and has become the most important organization for regional cooperation in Eurasia. Joining the SCO has provided India with a vital platform to participate in regional affairs, especially counterterrorism, energy cooperation, strengthening connectivity with Central Asia, and participation in solving the Afghan issue. Now India has no reason to act indifferently to the SCO.India has firmly pushed to enhance its relationship with the Global South this year. It is New Delhi's ambition to play a leading role in some organizations or mechanisms, but India's national strength cannot yet provide support. Objectively speaking, the country is currently not a dominant member in any global or regional organization or mechanism. Even the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation, in which India is the biggest member, has been paralyzed by the India-Pakistan rivalry. It is more in India's reality and interest to engage more through the SCO.Now, although New Delhi may show signs of indifference toward the SCO due to frictions with China, it will not move away from or withdraw from the SCO.First, India cannot prevent cooperation between China and other SCO members. Even if India is cold toward the SCO or acts as an obstacle on certain issues, China and other members can simply exclude India from cooperation. Among the SCO members, China has corresponding cooperation mechanisms with other members, such as the China-Russia comprehensive strategic partnership of coordination for a new era, the China-Pakistan-Iran trilateral consultation on counter-terrorism and security, the China-Pakistan-Afghanistan trilateral cooperation mechanism, and, most recently, the China-Central Asia Summit.Second, moving away or even withdrawing from the SCO would lead India to self-imposed isolation. While some Indians suggest their country give the SCO the cold shoulder, Iran and Belarus have decided to join the organization, and many other countries have shown interest in the SCO. Apparently, the organization will play a more critical role in the global future. Withdrawing from the SCO would leave India isolated in the region, which would not only weaken India's role in regional affairs but also lower India's strategic value in the US-led West.Third, India would lose a mechanism to counterbalance Pakistan if it decided to snub the SCO. One of India's motives for joining the SCO in the first place was to offset Pakistan's possible influence in the organization, and India's counterterrorism claims are largely directed at Pakistan. Suppose India shows less presence in the SCO or even ceases to be a member of the SCO. In that case, it will inevitably make Pakistan more prominent, and India will not be able to prevent the SCO from becoming more receptive to Pakistan's claims.Of course, the fact that SCO is being held online does not necessarily mean it cannot achieve results. As long as there is a need and willingness to cooperate, fruitful results can also be expected from virtual summits. Long is a professor at the School of International Relations at Sichuan International Studies University (SISU).

A US political game: Speculations of China's 'spy base' in Cuba surface ahead of Blinken's Beijing visit,Mark Blacklock,2023-06-12,"It's been 10 years now since a massive leak of secret American intelligence documents exposed to the world what most of the world had probably suspected for a long time: The US is the world's first and foremost nation when it comes to spying on its enemies, with massive resources devoted to global data gathering and analysis of information on its foes.It was somewhat less expected that the data leak revealed in excruciating detail too how Washington is also the global leader in covert intelligence gathering from nations supposedly its allies. At the time, France declared the attack on this sensitive aspect of its sovereignty intolerable. Then-US president Barack Obama tried to assuage the anger of those allies with the glib message that everyone does it. Obama's assertion of ""That's how intelligence services operate"" was backed up by his secretary of state, John Kerry, stating that the US wasn't the only one spying on its pals.The leaks, carried out by former National Security Agency worker Edward Snowden, exposed the NSA's global surveillance operations working with other governments and with corporations to monitor worldwide telecommunications. It also exposed spying on some of those both ""friendly"" governments - and some ""unfriendly"" ones - including Brazil, France, Mexico, China and Spain, plus dozens of world leaders like German chancellor Angela Merkel. The US also spied on its own citizens and the people of other nations. Britain was one of those targets for eavesdropping, which is ironic as the UK - then, as now - is home to one of the world's most important communications monitoring stations, Menwith Hill, in North Yorkshire. Although it is owned by the country's Ministry of Defence, it is operated by US Air Force and NSA personnel. Its job is to spy on communications around the world.A decade later, America is still at it. Dozens of classified Pentagon papers leaked online this year saw Washington stand accused of continuing to spy on its allies - this time, Israel, South Korea and Ukraine. The difference this time is that there has not been the same kind of media or diplomatic frenzy that accompanied the 2013 revelations. Why? Possibly because nobody is surprised anymore, and most expect it of the American military and intelligence community. It is clear that Washington's global spying reach is phenomenal. So it seems a bit rich that suddenly there is widespread outrage in America over a report that China and Cuba are developing a multi-billion dollar spy base on the Caribbean island to eavesdrop on American communications from barely 150 kilometers away. The report first came in the Wall Street Journal, citing anonymous sources, and - despite the sources being anonymous - spread like wildfire as other media outlets repeated the allegations. Even when both Cuba and China issued flat denials, the story continued to generate headlines. If not always, then often, ""anonymous sources"" can be official sources deliberately placing disinformation in the media, for whatever reason.Then the first bizarre thing happened. The Pentagon cast doubt upon the veracity of the allegations and accuracy of the report. ""We are not aware of China and Cuba developing any type of spy station,"" Brigadier General Pat Ryder, the Pentagon's press secretary, told journalists. This, too, was duly reported. It was rapidly followed by the second bizarre thing: An unnamed Biden administration official was quoted as saying, despite the earlier denials, that the White House had been aware of a clandestine agreement between Beijing and Havana to build a spy base - and that one has been top and running since 2019. To say these were mixed messages is an understatement.As a journalist, I was taught that when an anonymous source came to me with information to publish, my question to myself should be, ""Why is this person telling me this?"" And surely it is extraordinary of the US to accuse China of spying in its backyard. America has surrounded China with military bases, many capable of being used to monitor and spy on China. Most recently, Washington signed an agreement with Manila to build more military facilities (a development not universally welcomed in the Philippines). So getting hot under the collar about China's links with Cuba is a bit like a thief calling to catch a thief.Is it any coincidence that this flood of misleading tips, nods and winks is coming shortly before America's Secretary of State Antony Blinken is reportedly due to travel to Beijing in an effort to smooth out the kinks created in the US-China relationship since the start of the dysfunctional Biden administration?

UNESCO urged to stay alert to US rejoining as Washington aims to 'exploit it to counter China',GT staff reporters,2023-06-12,"In a move aimed at pushing back against China, the US told the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) that it is interested in rejoining the agency, nearly six years after it had ended its membership. Chinese experts urged the organization to stay alert to the US move, as Washington aims to exploit UNESCO as a tool to contain China, instead of making real contributions.A US State Department spokesperson confirmed to US media outlet Axios on Sunday that the US had privately notified the UN agency of its interest in rejoining. The report said that Richard Verma, the deputy secretary of state for management and resources, sent a letter to UNESCO Director-General Audrey Azoulay last week proposing a plan for the US to rejoin the agency.US lawmakers approved a bill last year that allocated more than $500 million needed to pay the US debt to UNESCO in an effort to allow its return as a full member, according to Axios. It's been nearly six years since the Trump administration announced it would leave UNESCO due to what it called anti-Israel bias. US selfishness is on full display from its government flip-flop on membership of international organizations, and Washington showed no respect to UNESCO by treating its membership like a child's game, Li Haidong, a professor at the Institute of International Relations at the China Foreign Affairs University, told the Global Times on Monday.Li urged UNESCO to stay alert to the US rejoining, and said that the motive of the US is neither healthy nor sincere. ""Washington simply wants to exploit the organization, and override it to serve as a US tool to contain China,"" said Li. The expert also warned that the US' current promise is shaky, because if a Republican candidate, or Trump himself, takes office next year, the US may walk out on the body again. Responding to the US official's previous comments on returning to UNESCO, Mao Ning, spokesperson of China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said in March that international organizations are platforms for global cooperation, not arenas for geopolitical games. We welcome it if the US truly sees China's positive role in UNESCO objectively, but if the US' return to the organization is meant to counter or check China's influence, it will only lead to questions over whether the US remains unchanged at heart and still puts ""America First"" before international public well-being.",CHINA,DIPLOMACY,"The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO) headquarters in Paris Photo: VCG",Author details not found,Author details not found,12,391,<FreqDist with 17 samples and 236 outcomes>

Palestinian president to visit China as efforts to build reconciliation with Israel continue,Liu Xin,2023-06-10,"China announced on Friday that at the invitation of Chinese President Xi Jinping, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas will pay a state visit to China from June 13 to 16. Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Wang Wenbin said the visit speaks volumes about the high-level friendly relations between China and Palestine.News of the visit to China came against the backdrop of a positive trend toward reconciliation in the Middle-East following the resumption of diplomatic relations between Iran and Saudi Arabia. Analysts said that China is working to promote de-escalation of the Palestine-Israel conflict via bilateral talks.At the Friday press conference, Wang said that President Abbas is an old and good friend of the Chinese people and the first Arab head of state to be hosted by China this year. China stands ready to work with Palestine to follow through on the common understandings of leaders of the two countries and take the China-Palestine traditional friendship to new heights.China and Palestine enjoy a traditional friendship. China is one of the first countries to recognize the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) and the State of Palestine. In recent years, thanks to the personal guidance of President Xi and President Abbas, China-Palestine relations have maintained a good momentum of growth with stronger political mutual trust and deeper friendship between the two peoples, said Wang.The Palestinian question is at the heart of the Middle East issue and matters to the region's peace and stability and global equity and justice. China has all along firmly supported the Palestinian people's just cause of restoring their legitimate national rights, Wang said.For 10 consecutive years, President Xi has sent congratulatory messages to the special commemorative meeting in observance of the International Day of Solidarity with the Palestinian People. More than once he put forward China's proposals for resolving the Palestinian question, stressing the need to resolutely advance a political settlement based on the two-state solution and intensify international efforts for peace.As a permanent member of the UN Security Council, China will continue to work with the international community for a comprehensive, just and enduring solution to the Palestinian question at an early date, said Wang.The resumption of diplomatic relations between Iran and Saudi Arabia under China's mediation marks a significant step for the reconciliation trend in the Middle-East and China is now working to promote a solution for the Palestine-Israel conflict as the tensions between the two countries have accelerated with increasing violence and clashes, casting a shadow in the region, Sun Degang, director of the Center for Middle Eastern Studies at Fudan University, told the Global Times.The Palestine-Israel conflict has its roots in the late 19th and early 20th centuries and has remained unsettled due to the US' partiality toward Israel, analysts said.Tensions have been mounting in the past two months. For example, Israel in April intensified airstrikes on military posts in the Gaza Strip and Lebanon in response to rockets fired from the areas into Israel. There were already tensions after Israeli police forcibly expelled Palestinian worshippers from the Al-Aqsa Mosque in East Jerusalem.China could play a special role in promoting the de-escalation of the Palestine-Israel conflict as it has been a trustworthy partner of Palestine and has also maintained close and pragmatic cooperation with Israel. By communicating with each side via bilateral talks, China could explore ways to ease tensions between Palestine and Israel as the first step, said Sun.The process for promoting talks and communication will not be easy and calls for time and patience, said Sun, adding that China's global security initiative will play a positive role in promoting a solution for the conflict.According to information from China's Foreign Ministry, Zhai Jun, the special envoy of the Chinese government on the Middle East issue, visited Israel and Palestine in March.Zhai also met in Jerusalem with United Nations Special Coordinator for the Middle East Peace Process (UNSCO) Tor Wennesland to exchange views on the Palestinian question.The Chinese special envoy said that China supports the UN and the UNSCO in their active mediation, and stands ready to work with the international community to make efforts to promote a proper resolution of the Palestinian question and achieve peace between Palestine and Israel.Wennesland spoke highly of China's active role in the Palestinian question. He also expressed his readiness to work with the Chinese side and other members of the international community to strengthen cooperation, deescalate the tension between Palestine and Israel, and promote the settlement of the Palestinian question on the basis of the two-state solution.",CHINA,DIPLOMACY,Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas Photo: VCG,"Reporter, Beijing","Liu Xin co-leads the Global Times China desk.

NATO+ exposes US impatience with India’s independent policy and NATO's malevolent expansion ambitions,Maitreya Bhakal,2023-06-09,"A major problem that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, or NATO, faced was keeping up the façade of being a North Atlantic military organization. It has largely failed at the task.The organization is responsible for millions of deaths around the globe, and it has brought the world to the brink of nuclear war on multiple occasions. A prevailing view holds that once the Soviet Union fell, the ostensible purpose of NATO (to combat the Soviet ""threat"" - real or imagined) ceased to exist, and NATO should have disbanded.As long as the USSR existed, the West and NATO could be kept in check. The Soviet Union presented a bulwark of peace to the savage alliance led by the Americans. As soon as the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, NATO and its members went off on an international homicidal rampage. Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1992, Serbia and Kosovo in 1999, Afghanistan in 2001, Iraq in 2003, Libya and Syria in 2011, Ukraine since even before 2014…with who knows what else is to come.And this is not even counting NATO's eastward expansion. When the Soviet Union collapsed, the Americans promised that NATO would not expand ""one inch to the East."" Mikhail Gorbachev should have known better than to trust the word of the West. Russia's key fault, should one ask Americans, is that it committed the cardinal sin of keeping its country too close to NATO member states.Today, the façade of being confined to the North Atlantic is no longer tenable. The US already considers the entire globe its backyard. Why should NATO, a US-led alliance, be any different?NATO Plus is an extension of NATO and an excuse to bring in US' cronies outside the North Atlantic: Australia, New Zealand, Japan, Israel, and South Korea. This is basically an attempt to globalize NATO, similar to the ""major non-NATO ally"" designation of the US regime.The latest attempt to test the waters of de-facto NATO expansion comes from the US regime's ""House Select Committee on the Strategic Competition between the United States and the Chinese Communist Party,"" a lazily named cabal controlled by US weapons manufacturers.Late last month, the committee recommended that NATO Plus be strengthened to include India.The aim of this move is apparently to ""boost global defence cooperation"" (code for increased weapons sales and profits) and win the ""strategic competition with the Chinese Communist Party"" (code for initiating war with China and blaming China for it).For years, the US has been trying to get India on its side, with barely any major success. India has a long record of strategic non-alignment on paper and multi-alignment based on national interest in practice. This has by now become the envy of developing nations across the globe and an irritant to the US, which abhors strategic independence from any major country.A key objective of the US regime is to exploit differences between China and its neighbors with whom it has boundary disputes. India is an obvious target.The Philippines is another. Already a US treaty ally, it is also embroiled in maritime disputes with China over areas and islands in the South China Sea. So far, both countries have acted in a mature (i.e. non-Western) manner and avoided their differences from turning into violent disputes. Such peaceful behavior troubles the US, which would prefer both nations to be at each other's throats. Recently, the defense ministers of the Philippines, Japan, Australia, and the US participated in their first-ever defense ministerial talks involving the four countries.Could the US regime's efforts to get India to join NATO Plus succeed? The committee that suggested it has little power, so the recommendation could simply be a way of testing the waters and keeping China on its toes. India's attempts at maintaining its strategic independence, such as its refusal to condemn Russia for a war in Ukraine that NATO initiated, make Washington insecure. It is not used to nations making up their own minds.India is unlikely to take this bonkers proposal seriously, especially one that is transparently intended as a geopolitical ""feeler"" without any detail on how it would work. Moreover, India also has its military relationship with Russia to consider, not to mention that this is the same alliance whose members keep selling weapons to Pakistan, a ""major non-NATO ally"" of the US.Yet the move exposes the US' impatience with India's independent foreign policy. Lacking an official statement from NATO or its leader, the US, India is wisely keeping quiet and continuing its policy of keeping out of US-China fights (i.e. US aggression on China) as long as its own interests are not involved.The author is an Indian commentator who writes about China, India, the US and global issues. opinion@globaltimes.com.cn",OPINION,VIEWPOINT,Illustration: Chen Xia/Global Times,Author details not found,Author details not found,43,748,<FreqDist with 21 samples and 420 outcomes>

 Palestinian children demonstrated on Tuesday in Gaza City to demand the UN World Food Programme (WFP) cancel its decision about stopping its humanitarian aid to poor families in the coastal enclave.During the demonstration in front of the UN Development Programme headquarters in Gaza, the children raised Palestinian flags and banners written with ""We do not want to starve,"" ""We need to enjoy our right of living in stability and security in our country,"" and ""Stopping the humanitarian aid means that a lot of poor family will lose their final chance to live decently.""The demonstration was organized by dozens of families, who received text messages sent by the WFP informing them that their finances and food have been stopped because of financial hardship experienced by the UN organization.""It is unfair to suspend the food and financial aids on the Palestinian families, who are suffering from poverty,"" Mena Mahmoud, an eleven-year-old girl, told Xinhua.""If the WFP stops its aid, we will suffer from the hunger that would increase the crimes among the local community,"" said Rahaf Tafish, another nine-year-old girl.Demanding food, water and safety, Mahmoud and Tafish called on the international community to help the Palestinian people in Gaza and support them to live a decent life.Subhi al-Moghrabi, the media spokesman of the poor families, told Xinhua that the demonstration is organized to express their refusal to the ""unprecedented"" decision issued by the WFP.""We are suffering from extremely poverty and do not have any other income sources, as most of us are patients who cannot work to make some money to keep our families afloat,"" the man complained, noting a lot of children, women and elderly people depend on the aid to live.In May, the WFP announced that it is going to suspend its financial aid to more than 200,000 needy families in the Palestinian territories because of an acute funding deficit.""Almost 60 percent of Palestinians it was providing food vouchers for will stop receiving them by June, while we may completely stop our operations by August if we do not receive any international funding,"" the UN organization said in a press statement.",PHOTO,WORLD,"Palestinian children take part in a demonstration in Gaza City, on June 6, 2023.

Reopening of Iran embassy in Saudi Arabia a milestone for reconciliation brokered by China,GT staff reporters,2023-06-07,"The reopening of the Iran Embassy in Saudi Arabia, which marked a milestone accomplishment for the two countries' reconciliation brokered by China, may lead to solutions of a series of rifts in the region and improve the geopolitical environment in the Middle East, Chinese analysts said on Wednesday. The event, which coincides with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken's visit to Saudi Arabia on the same day to steady bilateral relations and fend off China's increasing influence, demonstrates that the new view on security proposed by China and other developing countries is growing popular among regional countries, who are seeking to be the real owners of the region to avoid becoming proxies of some Western countries and the US, observers said.A ceremony was held inside Iran's new embassy compound in Saudi Arabia on Tuesday with dozens of diplomats and officials attending the reopening of the diplomatic mission for the first time in seven years, Reuters reported. Iran and Saudi Arabia reached a landmark agreement brokered by China in March to restore diplomatic ties and reopen their respective embassies. In April, Iran's Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian and Saudi Foreign Affairs Minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan Al Saud met in Beijing with Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Qin Gang, with Iran and Saudi Arabia announcing the resumption of diplomatic relations with immediate effect. The reopening of the Iran Embassy in Saudi Arabia after seven years of closure marks a milestone for the region and highlights regional countries' increasing efforts at strategic independence to become the real owners of the region, Sun Degang, director of the Center for Middle Eastern Studies at Fudan University, told the Global Times on Wednesday.For the past 11 years, the Middle East has been blighted with severe sectarian strife and endless proxy wars and conflicts, but now Saudi Arabia and Iran are working for reconciliation, which will further promote the regional peace and normalization of relations between previously divergent countries, including Iran and Arab states, and Turkey and Arab states, Sun said.The positive trend in the Middle East also shows how China's proposal on global security and developing countries' views of regional security and global governance have taken root and yielded achievements as regional countries chose to promote security via cooperation and communication, said the expert.Analysts hailed the ice-breaking resumption of diplomatic relations between Iran and Saudi Arabia and expected it to promote the resolution of a series of geopolitical conflicts and greatly improve the geopolitical environment in the Middle East. The US has been anxious about the current reconciliation in the Middle East as its allies are not closely following its baton but shaking hands with US' ""enemies."" On Tuesday, Blinken met with Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. The US top diplomat was also set to meet other senior Saudi officials in Riyadh, the capital, and the coastal city of Jeddah, Reuters reported. Topics on cooperation with Saudi Arabia to mediate the conflict in Sudan, improving US-Saudi Arabia relations, and promoting the normalization of relations between Saudi Arabia and Israel are on Blinken's agenda in Saudi Arabia, Ding Long, a professor with the Middle East Studies Institute of Shanghai International Studies University, told the Global Times. However, the real goal for Blinken and other senior officials who recently visited Saudi Arabia, including White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan, is to prevent geopolitical changes in the Middle East - from the resumption of diplomatic relations of Iran and Saudi Arabia to the return of Syria to the Arab League, said Ding.The US is eager to hold its significant ally Saudi Arabia fast in hand and save its ally system by fixing ties with Saudi Arabia. However, its strategy in the Middle East is out of date. The pillar of US-Saudi Arabia relations has been shaken as the US no longer needs oil from Saudi Arabia and its strategic contraction in the region means it cannot meet allies' demands for security, said Ding. While it is hard for the US to maintain a dominant influence in the Middle East, it still treats the area as the middle region for the competition of major countries and tries to exclude other countries' influence, which has incurred increasing dissatisfaction, said analysts. China's increasing influence in the region has worried the US, and some US media reported that during his stay in Saudi Arabia, Blinken worked to fend off China's and Russia's influence.Along with the increasing awareness of independence is the decline of US influence in the region. The US should abandon its Cold War mentality and the hegemonic mentality of treating the region as its sphere of influence, said Sun, noting that the Middle East is large enough and China has always welcomed different countries to contribute to the building of the region.",CHINA,DIPLOMACY,Iran reopened its embassy in Saudi Arabia on Tuesday after seven years of closure.

Blinken visit won't stop US decline in Middle East,Ding Long,2023-06-06,"
US Secretary of State Antony Blinken kicked off his visit to Saudi Arabia on Tuesday, after CIA Director Bill Burns and National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan. During his visit, Blinken is expected to discuss bilateral and multilateral issues with the Saudi side, including cooperation to mediate the conflict in Sudan, and promoting ties between Saudi Arabia and Israel. He will also hold a ministerial meeting with the foreign ministers of the GCC countries. The frequent visits of senior US officials to Saudi Arabia are driven by deeper strategic considerations. Saudi Arabia is the world's largest oil exporter and one of the most important allies of the US in the Middle East. Blinken's visit demonstrates the US is attaching greater importance to its relations with Saudi Arabia, which is becoming increasingly detached from the US orbit impacted by the tide of reconciliation in the Middle East. The US is eager to stabilize its relationship with Saudi Arabia and save its precarious Middle East alliance system. However, there are contradictions in US' Middle East policy, and it has been out of touch with the new geopolitical reality in the region. Therefore, it is unlikely that Blinken's visit will yield any significant results.Besides the agendas discussed at the table, Blinken aims to achieve the following three goals. Firstly, the US hopes to strengthen coordination with Saudi Arabia on energy policy. Since the outbreak of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, the US has used both soft and hard tactics against Saudi Arabia, hoping that the latter would join the US camp to fill the supply gap caused by the Russian oil embargo through increased oil production, stabilize oil prices, and s ease domestic inflationary pressures. However, Saudi Arabia did not succumb to US pressure and instead strengthened cooperation with Russia under the ""OPEC+"" framework and restricted production many times, which humiliated the US.Just before Blinken's trip, the OPEC+ group of oil-producing countries reached an agreement to extend output cuts into next year. Saudi also announced on Sunday it would?cut one million barrels of oil a day in July to boost sagging oil prices. The failure of energy policy coordination reflects that Saudi Arabia and the US have changed from cooperative partners to competitors in the field of energy. This change has fundamentally shaken the alliance between the two countries based on the logic that the US provides security for Saudi Arabia in exchange for oil supply from Saudi.Secondly, in terms of geopolitics, the US is eager to curb the further spread of the effects of the Middle East reconciliation tide. After China successfully facilitated the reconciliation and resumption of diplomatic relations between Saudi Arabia and Iran in March this year, a wave of ""reconciliation"" with strong potential and climaxes has been set off in the Middle East. The rapid geopolitical changes go against the wishes of the US and accelerate the decline of US power in the Middle East.Thirdly, in terms of great power competition, the US is attempting to exclude China and Russia in the Middle East where international competitive factors such as resources, markets, technology, and military converge. On one hand, the US is implementing a strategic contraction from the Middle East, while on the other hand, it is vigorously guarding against countries like China, Russia, and Iran filling the ""vacuum"" left by its departure. The US is making every effort to obstruct strategic cooperation between Middle Eastern countries on the one side, and China and Russia on the other, and is launching new cooperation plans to counter the two countries' influence. During Sullivan's visit to Saudi Arabia in May, the US discussed railway project to link the Middle East with India. The intention of the project is to engage in an ""infrastructure war"" with China and disrupt the advancement of the China-proposed Belt and Road Initiative in the Middle East. However, numerous contradictions have led the US' Middle East policy into a quagmire. Even frequent visits by high-ranking officials like Blinken cannot change the declining influence of the US in the Middle East. Firstly, the US cannot realize a ""withdrawing while fighting"" approach in the Middle East. After the US reduces its military presence, it's inevitable its Middle Eastern allies will seek strategic autonomy and ease the strategic tension with regional adversaries. The overall relative decline of US strength and the reduction of its input in the Middle East will inevitably lead to the decline of its Middle Eastern alliance system.Secondly, the US' Middle East policy is far behind the changes in the region. The geopolitical changes in the Middle East reflect the historical trend, in which regional countries seek unity, development, and strategic autonomy. However, the US still attempts to gain arbitration power over Middle Eastern affairs by stirring up regional conflicts and camp confrontation, hoping to benefit from the chaos. The wave of reconciliation sweeping across the Middle East indicates that the US is lagging behind the changes of the era, and its Middle East policy that goes against the tide will inevitably suffer defeat.Thirdly, the Cold War mentality should not define the relationship between the Middle East and major powers. The US views the Middle East as a new battleground for strategic competition with China and Russia. However, the interests of Middle Eastern countries have become highly diversified, and they are no longer willing to blindly follow the US and serve as pawns in its global strategy. Instead, they formulate foreign policies based on their own national interests, engage with multiple major powers, and seek diverse balance. The scenario of rallying allies to resist China and Russia, a Cold War tactic of the US, is no longer possible in the Middle East. The vibrant cooperation between China and Middle Eastern countries in the fields of economy, trade, and investment, as well as the close coordination between Russia and oil-producing countries in the Middle East on energy policies, reflects the ineffectiveness of the Cold War mentality.The author is a professor with the Middle East Studies Institute of Shanghai International Studies University. opinion@globaltimes.com.cn",OPINION,VIEWPOINT,Illustration: Chen Xia/GT,Author details not found,Author details not found,43,990,<FreqDist with 18 samples and 588 outcomes>
Fans unhappy with prices for Messi’s friendly game in Beijing,Lu Wenao,2023-06-05,"Soccer fans are expressing their unhappiness over skyrocketing ticket prices for the friendly between Argentina and Australia that is scheduled to be held at the Workers' Stadium in Beijing on June 15. The organizers, who only announced the game less than a month before its scheduled date, unveiled ticket prices on Thursday, which range from 580 yuan ($82) to 4,800 yuan. Ticket sales for the game are set to commence on Monday.Argentina, winners of the 2022 FIFA World Cup, will bring the star-studded first-team to the match in Beijing. Seven-time Ballon d'Or winner Lionel Messi is included in Argentina's 27-man squad for the game.Ticket prices are far steeper than the regular Chinese Super League games that the Workers' Stadium hosts. The lowest ticket price for a Beijing Guoan game is just 120 yuan. Coincidentally, the Chinese national soccer team is scheduled to play friendlies against the Palestine team and Myanmar national team in Dalian, Northeast China's Liaoning Province, on June 16 and 20, with the ticket prices ranging from 180 yuan to 480 yuan. Industry insiders indicate that a limited marketing timeframe made the organizers choose high ticket prices to secure profitability.""Announcing the game day very late means the organizers have a very limited time for marketing, which is vital to generate income,"" Beijing-based sports commentator Luo Ming told the Global Times on Sunday. ""The high prices mean that the marketing campaign did not go well, thus the organizers have to rely on ticket prices for income.""Despite the high prices, there are still Chinese fans who are willing to fork over money for the opportunity to watch Messi play in Beijing, as they consider it a ""once in a lifetime"" opportunity as the superstar is just years from retirement. In June 2022, when Argentina, then winners of the Copa America instead of world champions, were taking on European Championship winners Italy at Wembley Stadium in London, England, ticket prices ranged from 25 to 45 pounds ($31 to $56).",SPORT,SOCCER,"Lionel Messi of Argentina kisses the World Cup Trophy while holding the Golden Boot award on December 18, 2022 in Lusail City, Qatar.

"Arab League’s visit to Xinjiang rejects Western accusations of ethnic genocide, religious persecution",Global Times,2023-06-05,"The delegation from the Arab League, after wrapping up a visit to Northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, said that allegations of ""ethnic genocide"" and ""religious persecution"" are completely false, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson stated on Monday. Arab countries appreciate China's efforts in caring for minority groups, including Muslims in Xinjiang, and they will continue to support China's endeavors in maintaining the development and stability of Xinjiang.After attending the 18th senior diplomats and officials' meeting and the 7th senior official-level strategic political dialogue of the China-Arab States Cooperation Forum, the 34-member group from 16 Arab countries, including Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Algeria visited Xinjiang between May 30 to June 2.The group visited a number of locations in Xinjiang and said that the reality on the ground does not match what is portrayed by Western media. The region boasts harmony and stability, a rapidly growing economy and a colorful and prosperous culture, with residents living and working in peace and contentment.Mohammed Haj Ibrahim, director-general of the Department of Asian and African Affairs under the Syrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said that China has made constructive contributions to the fight against terrorism and extremism. International cooperation on counter-terrorism should be strengthened, including the exchange of information and experience.The delegation visited the Id Kah Mosque and the old town of Kashgar, some 1,500 kilometers southwest of Urumqi. Mohamed Moustafa Kamal Mohamed, permanent representative of Egypt to the Arab League, said he was very glad to see that the historic mosques in Kashgar are well preserved and equipped with modern facilities.The group praised China's 7-billion-yuan ($987 million) renovation of the old town of Kashgar, an ancient Silk Road city with a history stretching back more than 2,000 years.Mohanad Alaklouk, permanent representative of Palestine to the Arab League, said he was very happy to see the ancient buildings and experience the long-standing culture of the old town of Kashgar on his first trip to Xinjiang.The Chinese government has made huge efforts to renovate the old town and preserve its wonderful cultural heritage, and all these efforts and achievements are impressive, he said.Arab countries have consistently held a controversial position on the Xinjiang issue, stated Wang Wenbin, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman, adding that the genuine impressions of the Arab League delegation during their visit to Xinjiang once again fully demonstrate that the sinister plot of manipulating the Xinjiang issue to smear China is destined to fail.Global Times",CHINA,DIPLOMACY,"A delegation of diplomats and officials from the Arab League and its Secretariat visit the old town of Kashgar in northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, May 31, 2023.

"Asia-Pacific security: two visions, two prospects",Zhao Xiaozhuo,2023-06-01,"The 20th IISS Shangri-La Dialogue is set to take place in Singapore from Friday to Sunday. The current schedule includes a speech by Chinese State Councilor and Defense Minister Li Shangfu on ""China's new security initiative,"" and a speech by US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin on ""the US' leadership in the Indo-Pacific.""From the theme alone, it's apparent that Austin's speech will focus on how to strengthen the US' dominant position in Asia-Pacific security affairs. In recent years, the Shangri-La Dialogue has gradually become a platform for the US defense secretary to expound on the US' regional security strategy. Although the specifics vary from year to year, the basic routine is the same and can be summarized as ""trilogy."" First, pointing the finger at some countries, emphasizing ""security threats,"" and even claiming that the threats are imminent. Second, taking the US as the center and dividing regional countries into three categories based on their proximity to the US: ""allies"" in the inner circle, ""partner countries"" in the middle circle, and ""other countries"" in the outer circle, with a focus on attracting allies. Third, emphasizing the US' military measures, including strengthening military deployments, investing in military resources, enhancing joint exercises with allies, and ensuring allies' confidence in the US military.In recent years, some signs of insecurity in the Asia-Pacific region have caused concern, with a lack of strategic trust, the resurgence of Cold War thinking, increased tension in relations between major powers, and intensified camp confrontation. The impeded momentum of regional peaceful development is closely related to the emphasis on military alliances, protectionism, and pursuit of zero-sum games by individual major countries. The Indo-Pacific Economic Framework is essentially a disguised protectionism that promotes internal circulation within small groups, undermines the existing regional cooperation framework, hinders free trade, and reverses regional integration. Although the US claims that its policy aims for regional peace and stability, what people see is the opposite, as its policy harms regional peace and stability. The US also claims that its policy serves the interests of regional countries, but what people see is that it pursues its own interests, including overseas military bases and activities, and ""leadership in the Indo-Pacific region."" Ultimately, the US prioritizes its hegemonic interests over promoting peace and development that benefit the Asia-Pacific region as a whole.In contrast, China's foreign policy emphasizes ""peace,"" ""development,"" and a ""big family."" From building a human community with a shared future to the Global Security Initiative, Global Development Initiative, and Global Civilization Initiative, China's emphasis is highly consistent: openness and inclusiveness, peaceful development, cooperation, and win-win outcomes. China's pursuit is clear: to develop a new security path through dialogue rather than confrontation, through partnership rather than alliance, and through win-win rather than zero-sum games in response to the common aspirations of countries for peace, development, and cooperation.Additionally, China's initiatives have been successfully implemented in practice. The country has been dedicated to finding solutions to hotspot issues with Chinese characteristics, emphasizing the importance of promoting peace and dialogue. This year, China played a crucial role in mediating a historic reconciliation between Saudi Arabia and Iran, setting a positive example for other regional countries to follow in resolving conflicts through peaceful means. Furthermore, China has released a position paper titled ""China's Position on the Political Settlement of the Ukraine Crisis;"" President Xi Jinping visited Russia and spoke with Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on the phone; and Chinese envoys have actively worked to promote a resolution to the crisis. China has also been actively involved in mediation diplomacy, taking proactive steps to promote political solutions to hotspot issues in Iran, the Korean Peninsula, Syria, and Palestine. The upcoming speech by the Chinese defense minister at the Shangri-La Dialogue will focus on ""China's new security initiative,"" and people are eagerly anticipating what this new initiative will entail and what makes it unique.Comparing the approaches of China and the US toward Asia-Pacific security in terms of philosophy, policy, and actions, it is evident that the US is a force for confrontation and division, while China is a force for peace and cooperation. The competition between the US and China is not just a game of two forces, but also a contest between two visions for the Asia-Pacific region. The two world wars and the Cold War have demonstrated that conflict brings about great devastation, disaster, and suffering. Today, with human civilization highly developed, we should not repeat these tragedies. The prospect of win-win cooperation is eagerly awaited, but it will not come automatically and requires persistent efforts. At present, Asia-Pacific security has reached a crossroads: either to maintain regional peace that benefits all countries and sustain the momentum of prosperity and development, or to encourage confrontation and repeat the mistakes of the Cold War and hot war. It is believed that the regional countries will make the right choice based on their own judgment.The author is a research fellow at China's Academy of Military Sciences. opinion@globaltimes.com.cn",OPINION,VIEWPOINT,Illustration: Chen Xia/GT,Author details not found,Author details not found,33,800,<FreqDist with 15 samples and 481 outcomes>
"US woos India to join ‘NATO Plus’ ahead of Modi-Biden meeting, harms New Delhi’s strategic autonomy",Wang Qi,2023-06-01,"The US has stepped up efforts to woo India ahead of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to Washington, with its envoy to India recently hailing New Delhi as ""one of Washington's closest allies,"" and saying India should decide whether to join US-led NATO Plus while highlighting the need to deepen defense cooperation. Experts said on Thursday that the US' hyping of the issue is more about shaping a favorable public opinion environment for its own ""Indo-Pacific"" security architecture. Although India's official attitude toward NATO Plus membership remains unknown, if India makes the unwise choice of leaning toward NATO, it will cause great harm to New Delhi's strategic autonomy, international status and relations with neighboring countries, experts said.In an interview with Indian media outlet WION on Tuesday, US Ambassador to India Eric Garcetti said that ""anything is on the table"" when asked to comment on a report mentioning that a US committee has recommended that India be included in the US-led NATO framework. Garcetti said it was up to New Delhi to decide whether it wants to join NATO plus, emphasizing that India is one of Washington's closest allies. NATO Plus, currently NATO Plus 5, is a security arrangement that brings together NATO and five aligned nations - Australia, New Zealand, Japan, Israel and South Korea - to boost defense and intelligence ties.On May 27, a US House committee adopted a policy proposal to include India in NATO Plus so as to ""deter China's aggression"" on the Taiwan question.Qian Feng, director of the research department at the National Strategy Institute at Tsinghua University, told the Global Times that the US wants to replicate in the Asia-Pacific region the model of confronting Russia through the NATO framework to counter China, in which the US regards India as a key link that will determine whether its ""Indo-Pacific strategy"" will succeed. India also wants to leverage the US and NATO framework to increase its influence and, to some extent, its strategic leverage with China, Qian noted. The US' attempts to woo India came ahead of Modi's state visit to Washington DC on June 22 at the invitation of US President Joe Biden. On June 5, US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin will meet with his Indian counterpart Rajnath Singh in New Delhi during his seventh ""Indo-Pacific"" tour, where he is expected to ""further deepen the US-India Major Defense Partnership,"" according to a release from US Department of Defense. The possibility of India's closer cooperation with NATO in the future cannot be ruled out, but for now, India is wary of being pushed into a direct confrontation with China by the US, even if China-India relations are at low ebb due to a border standoff, Qian said.In addition, in the case of the deterioration of US-Russia relations and the continuation of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, India will also take into account its long-term cooperation with Russia, and keep a certain distance with the US, the expert noted. Li Haidong, a professor at the China Foreign Affairs University, told the Global Times on Thursday that by hyping India's accession to NATO Plus, which is unlikely to occur in the near future, the US is actually looking to shape a favorable public opinion and political environment, laying the groundwork for the possible establishment of a closer relationship between India and the NATO mechanism in the future, so as to further expand US influence in the Asia-Pacific region. However, New Delhi needs to be awake to the fact that India's growing global status comes from its maintaining strategic autonomy and not taking sides, Li said. ""For India, it is in its best national interest to maintain a moderate balance among the great powers.""India has always longed for leadership of the Global South. If New Delhi chooses to become part of the US entourage by leaning toward the NATO mechanism, which represents the security interests of the US and its allies, it will have a great impact on its global leadership ambitions, as well as its position as a major power and its room for diplomatic maneuvering, Qian said. ""If India takes sides, it will pose a huge challenge to its position in regional organizations like the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation, and its relations with China and Russia,"" Li said.",CHINA,DIPLOMACY,"Indian Prime minister Narendra Modi inspects military guard of honor after arriving at the historic Red Fort on the occasion of India's Independence Day in Delhi, India, Aug. 15, 2022.

China congrats Erdogan on reelection win; ‘Beijing-Ankara ties to continue being stable’,GT staff reporters,2023-05-29,"After winning reelection and extending his two decades in power, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan met with his supporters in Ankara and called on them to build a ""century of Turkey"" together.  Analysts said that during his extended tenure, Erdogan may continue a balanced and pluralistic foreign policy with geopolitical ambitions, but with the contradictions in Turkey-US relations still proving difficult to resolve, Turkey may become more estranged from the US and the West.Erdogan, the 69-year-old head of the Islamist-rooted AK Party, won re-election with 52.1 percent of the vote and challenger Kemal Kilicdaroglu had 47.9 percent, Reuters reported. On Monday, Chinese President Xi Jinping congratulated Erdogan on his reelection as President of the Republic of Turkey, and said that China and Turkey are both major developing countries and emerging market countries, and share extensive common interests. In recent years, the China-Turkey strategic cooperative relationship has maintained a momentum of development, and practical cooperation in various fields has made positive headway.  Xi said he prizes the development of China-Turkey relations and stands ready to work with Erdogan to promote mutual understanding and mutual support on issues concerning each other's core interests and major concerns so as to boost the sustained, sound and stable development of the two countries' strategic cooperative relationship.The election in Turkey, a country located at the crossroads of East and West, has drawn the world's attention in recent months, with some Western media calling it ""one of the most consequential"" elections for the country. No candidate won more than 50 percent of the first round of voting on May 14. After the result came out, Erdogan's challenger, Kilicdaroglu, called it ""the most unfair election in years"" but did not dispute the outcome, Reuters reported. Erdogan's victory extends his tenure as the longest-serving leader since Mustafa Kemal Ataturk established modern Turkey a century ago, while his long period in power has also come under criticism from the US and some Western media. Turkey entered ""the era of Erdogan"" at the beginning of the 21st century, and the Turkish leader's individual style marked by the country's domestic politics, diplomacy and major policies that he has implemented for the past two decades will be carried on after his victory, Tian Wenlin, a research fellow at the China Institutes of Contemporary International Relations, told the Global Times. Erdogan's 20 consecutive years in power have freed Turkey from frequent government changes and brought more stability, order and predictability to the country's politics. Meanwhile, with the growth of its comprehensive national strength, Turkey has grown into an important geopolitical power that is more deeply involved in multiple regions and sensitive issues, and effectively achieved its strategic goals, Zan Tao, an expert on Turkish affairs and an associate professor at Peking University, told the Global Times. In terms of social culture, Erdogan has promoted ""traditional values"" in Turkey, which has inspired confidence and patriotism among Turkish people on the one hand and made Turkish society increasingly conservative on the other, with more value placed on Islamic symbols and the abolition of some policies on secularization, including not wearing headscarves in public places.The domestic economy will top Erdogan's agenda in his new term, analysts said. The Turkish lira has devalued steadily in recent years, halving in value in one year alone, and Erdogan's unorthodox economic policies, including a long-term aversion to raising interest rates, have been criticized by some in Turkey for contributing to rising inflation, media reported. Erdogan has promoted privatization to drive economic development since he took office 20 years ago, which has also led to a widening wealth gap and an unstable economic and domestic environment. In recent years, Turkey has experienced sluggish economic growth and monetary crisis, Tian said. Without adjusting the previous neoliberal approach, its economy may fall into a worse situation and become a major challenge for Erdogan's governance, said Tian.Aside from high inflation, dealing with the aftermath of the devastating earthquake and uniting the nation will also pose a major challenge for Erdogan. Moreover, more global attention has also been paid to possible changes in Turkey's foreign policy and its influence on the geopolitical situation against the backdrop of the Ukraine crisis. Pluralistic foreign policyAside from Chinese leaders, several world leaders have congratulated Erdogan on his electoral victory. Russian President Vladimir Putin on Sunday congratulated Erdogan and called him his ""dear friend,"" media reported. US President Joe Biden on Monday also congratulated Erdogan on the election win. He said in a post on Twitter, ""I look forward to continuing to work together as NATO Allies on bilateral issues and shared global challenges."" Zan told the Global Times that Erdogan's reelection means Turkey will continue its balanced and pluralistic foreign policy, but from the perspective of Turkey's national interests and Erdogan's ruling style, it will still be difficult to resolve the contradictions in Turkey-US relations in the next five years and the country may become more estranged from the US and the West.Over the past few years, Turkey-US relations have been ""contradictory and mutually necessary"", as Erdogan has advocated an independent foreign policy. For example, Erdogan did not follow the US on sanctions against Russia, and on the issue of NATO's eastward expansion, Turkey has obstructed the admission of new members. Erdogan also resisted US pressure and purchased Russia's air defense missile system, said Zan.But as a NATO member, Turkey in the future will still be necessary for the alliance and is expected to continue cooperating with the US on issues such as anti-terrorism in the Middle East and Afghanistan, said Zan. Tian described relations between the US and Turkey as those who quarrel a lot but cannot leave each other. The US believed to be interfered with the coup attempt in 2016 is one motive for Erdogan to tilt to Russia and turn to the East. But Turkey will not use all its leverage on Russia and its relations with the country have also become a bargaining chip in dealing with the West.As the conflict between Russia and Ukraine continues, Turkey is expected to continue maintaining a high degree of vigilance against Russia, but not join the Western camp against it, said analysts. The Erdogan government has geopolitical ambitions and may continue to actively participate in mediation of the Ukraine crisis so as to further enhance its status as a regional power and its role in international geopolitics, said Zan. ""In the upcoming period, we foresee Turkey actively participating in the current normalization process in the Middle East. We will witness a Turkey that strengthens its relations with countries in the region from Syria to Egypt, and from Saudi Arabia to Israel,"" Tunç Akkoç, editor in chief of Harici Media in Turkey, told the Global Times.We may also observe different models of negotiations in which China and Turkey also act as mediators in the Ukraine crisis, said Akkoç. At a press conference on Monday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning also congratulated President Erdogan on his reelection as Turkish president, saying China supports Turkey in following a development path that suits its own national conditions. Mao said that China attaches great importance to China-Turkey relations. In recent years, under the guidance of the two heads of state, the two countries have achieved fruitful cooperation in various fields, benefiting the two peoples. China stands ready to work with Turkey to scale new heights in the China-Turkey strategic relationship of cooperation.  Maintaining relations with China is also part of Erdogan's policy of ""turning to the East,"" said analysts. Turkey will look for ways to enhance its partnership with China, as relations with it were important topics for both parties during the election campaign and the Belt and Road Initiative is viewed as a big opportunity for Turkey, said Akkoç.Zan said that in Erdogan's coming term, the relationship between China and Turkey is expected to continue being stable. ""As a country that plays an important geopolitical role, Turkey attaches great importance to China's rising international influence, especially its dominant position in multilateral mechanisms. This kind of emphasis is even more prominent in the era of major changes in Eurasian geopolitics.""Moreover, China has made great achievements in fighting against the ""three evil forces"" of terrorism, separatism and extremism with its achievements in its Xinjiang region. Turkey adopts a relatively pragmatic attitude and has always avoided taking radical actions that would provoke China too much, the expert said.",CHINA,DIPLOMACY,"Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan speaks at a political rally held at Ataturk Airport of Istanbul, Türkiye, May 7, 2023.

"Ten years after Snowden leaks, dangers of US spying continue",Bradley Blankenship,2023-05-18,"This May marks the 10th anniversary of US National Security Agency (NSA) contractor Edward Snowden's leaks, which showed the world Washington's global bulk data collection program and sparked an international manhunt, leading the former intelligence worker to flee to Russia. Snowden is a divisive figure in the West, considered by many a hero but by others a traitor. During his NSA work, Snowden became disillusioned with the programs he worked on, trying in vain to raise ethical concerns to his superiors through internal mechanisms that were ignored. Eventually, he took a holiday from an NSA facility in Hawaii in May 2013, telling his bosses that he needed to seek treatment for epilepsy, but actually flew to Hong Kong and revealed a trove of documents in early June to journalists Glenn Greenwald, Laura Poitras, Barton Gellman and Ewen MacAskill. These leaks spurred headlines in mainstream US and international media that drew attention to the NSA's global surveillance program, which included programs like PRISM, which allows for the direct monitoring of Americans' Google and Yahoo accounts, or XKeyscore, which is an analytical tool that collects ""almost anything done on the internet,"" according to The Guardian's reporting. One of the breaking points for Snowden was when former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper lied under oath to Congress on March 15, 2013, saying that the NSA does not collect data on millions of Americans. Clapper was never held accountable for this blatant lie. However, the US Department of Justice unsealed charges against Snowden for two counts of violating the 1917 Espionage Act and theft of government property on June 21, 2013, in addition to his passport having been revoked. Despite the accusations against Snowden, he remains a hero to many, particularly younger Americans, and people outside the US. That's because he exposed Washington's global espionage campaign that can target any single individual in the world. But, as history shows, this is far from an isolated incident and more of a common activity in Washington.For example, I recently interviewed former Secretary of State Colin Powell's chief of staff Lawrence Wilkerson, a retired army colonel, and he told me that another trove of intelligence leaks circulating this spring, called the biggest leaks since Snowden, were ""nothing new."" According to him, not only did US intelligence agencies spy on foreign leaders - but they also wiretapped his boss during some conversations, including one with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov. And he also said that he was present for espionage on conversations among European officials and at the United Nations. The leaks we spoke about showed that the US spied on Canada, Israel and the Republic of Korea, going as far as wiretapping Seoul's National Security Office (NSO), the highest defense organ in the ROK, in order to gauge whether Korean officials support Washington's proxy conflict in Ukraine. And indeed, we know this is not unique since news broke in 2021 that the US spied on European leaders, including former German Chancellor Angela Merkel. Washington had been wiretapping German officials all along through Danish channels. For its part, China's National Computer Virus Emergency Response Center and Chinese cybersecurity company 360 recently unveiled a detailed report that shows how the US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) has plotted regime change around the world. Particularly, it describes how the technological revolution of the 21st century has given the CIA new tools to undermine foreign governments. The report also gives a detailed analysis of the CIA's bureaucratic structure, which one former CIA officer told me looks legitimate but that these operations are handled at station headquarters in Washington. Despite 10 years of the public receiving hard evidence that Washington has the capability to spy on virtually anyone and that no one's basic privacy is safe from the nefarious activities of US spying, Washington's global espionage campaign continues. US allies are - either wittingly or unwittingly - accusing other governments, like China's, of having ""back doors"" or other nefarious means to access private data while Washington is already proven to conduct these exact activities. It's high time that the international community rejects such double standards, stands up for sovereignty and says no to Washington's unending global surveillance that undermines the legitimacy of states and erodes global security. The age of unilateral regime change operations must come to a hard end as we enter a decade past the heroic efforts of Edward Snowden.The author is a Prague-based American journalist, columnist and political commentator.

Palestinians mark 75th anniversary of Nakba,Xinhua,2023-05-16," 

 Palestinians in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip marked the 75th anniversary of the Palestinian Nakba day, or the day of ""catastrophe,"" on Monday with large-scale rallies and demonstrations.The Nakba Day is observed annually on May 15 by Palestinians to remember the expulsion of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians from their homes after the establishment of Israel in 1948.In Gaza, dozens of Palestinians took to the streets, marching through the main thoroughfares, hoisting Palestinian flags, and displaying banners emphasizing the right of return.The demonstration culminated at the headquarters of the United Nations Special Coordinator for the Middle East Peace Process in the western part of the city.Imad al-Agha, an official from Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas' Fatah Movement, addressed the gathering, affirming the Palestinians' commitment to their right to return to ""historic Palestine"" and their determination to achieve it.""Our people await the awakening of global conscience to resolve their legal question, which has become the oldest and largest issue known to the world and the United Nations,"" he stated.The Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas), a militant group that controls the besieged Palestinian enclave, said in a statement that the Nakba day came ""in the wake of a recent round of conflict where our Palestinian people, united with their resistance in Gaza, proved that they are capable of defending their national rights.""The commemoration of the Nakba day in Gaza follows a ceasefire agreement brokered by Egypt between Israel and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) movement in Gaza, bringing an end to a five-day deadly confrontation.According to Israeli and Palestinian sources, the recent escalation resulted in the death of one Israeli woman and 33 Palestinians, including six prominent PIJ leaders.In the West Bank city of Ramallah, a large-scale demonstration took place in front of the tomb of the late Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat before proceeding to the city center.Participants observed a moment of silence for 75 seconds, symbolizing the 75th anniversary of Nakba.Palestinian Prime Minister Mohammed Ishtaye, who participated in the rally with other officials, said ""the Nakba is a crime that extends over 75 years, and our people are still paying with their blood and living flesh the bill of aggression.""In New York, the United Nations headquarters is set to hold its first-ever commemoration of the Nakba anniversary, with the participation of Palestinian President Abbas, who will deliver a speech during the online event.",PHOTO,WORLD,"Palestinian people participate in a demonstration marking the 75th anniversary of the Nakba Day in the West Bank city of Ramallah, on May 15, 2023.

Middle East does not need Big Mac US embassy aiming for regional chaos,Global Times,2023-05-14,"What's the point of the US to build the second-largest embassy worldwide in such a small country as Lebanon? It is a strong signal to show that the US is in the Middle East to stay, through an exaggeratedly huge new command center, especially at a time when burgeoning detente and peace process are unfolding in the region, healing the wounds caused by Washington. ""A massive new US embassy complex in a tiny Middle East nation is raising eyebrows,"" CNN reported on Saturday. ""The US' new compound in Lebanon looks like a city of its own. Sprawling over a 43-acre site, the complex in the Beirut suburb of Awkar is almost two-and-a-half times the size of the land the White House sits on and more than 21 soccer fields,"" the article said. It became a news story because a small country like Lebanon clearly does not need such a large embassy or a large number of diplomats. ""It is likely that a significant proportion of the embassy staff will consist of intelligence and military personnel. In other words, the embassy's intelligence and military functions will far outweigh its diplomatic role,"" Ding Long, a professor at the Middle East Studies Institute of Shanghai International Studies University, told the Global Times.The US does not care that Lebanon's economy has been in turmoil since 2019 or that nearly 80 percent of the Lebanese live in poverty. But it does care about Lebanon's geographical position - bordering Syria to the north and east and Israel to the south. Experts believe that, as a traditional geopolitical center of the Middle East and the frontline of the Arab-Israeli conflict, Lebanon is viewed by the US as a frontier stronghold to contain Hezbollah and Iran. At the same time, Washington can also closely monitor Russia's military presence in Syria. Upon completion, the US will be able to not only collect significant amount of military intelligence from the Middle East via the new embassy, but also take it as a crucial base for US special operations forces, Song Zhongping, a Chinese military expert and TV commentator, told the Global Times, noting that these will help orchestrate color revolutions in Middle Eastern countries to overthrow anti-US regimes and foster pro-US opposition forces. ""Rather than defining it as an embassy, it is more of a US headquarters,"" he said. Plans for the embassy complex were announced in 2015. The project apparently has not been affected by the US' withdrawal from the Middle East. The US' obsession and stubborn intention to interfere in regional affairs and maintain its hegemony in the Middle East has never dimmed.According to Ding, Washington is only decreasing its direct military involvement in the Middle East; it does not mean that the US is reducing its ambitions for hegemony there. The fact is the US is enhancing its diplomatic, intelligence, and other soft power means in the region. However, the US can hardly reach what it wishes.One significant cause is that the US' Middle East policy is too self-serving and severely detached from reality. Take Lebanon, it needs development and stable neighboring environment to tackle its challenges as many people there are unable to afford basic commodities, including food, medicine and electricity, rather than a Big Mac US embassy, which is widely believed to be full of ill intentions and will create more regional chaos. As a result, ""Middle Eastern countries' trust in the US is declining, while their strategic autonomy is rising. They begin to pursue diversification of allies and partners and implement a strategy of striking balance among major powers,"" Ding said. Meanwhile, when talking about the massive US embassy compound in Lebanon, a question can hardly be ignored - where is the money coming from, when the US has been facing debt ceiling crisis over and over again in the past years? It's the money from American taxpayers, it's also the money for tomorrow, which US borrowed from other countries. Yet the US couldn't care less about it. It is accustomed to spending future money for today. And it will print more money, escalate inflation, economic and currency crises, and spill them over to other countries, Song said. Unfortunately, this is not the way to save US hegemony anymore, nor could it stir up more troubles in the Middle East or any parts of the world.What the Middle East needs from the US is turning American embassies to their normal function - carrying out genuine diplomacy and facilitate communication, rather than being strongholds for color revolutions or a headquarters for armed militants under the guise of ""embassies,"" which, in the past, merely played the role as malignant tumor in the region, bringing disastrous consequences to the innocent local people.",OPINION,OBSERVER,Illustration: Liu Rui/GT,Author details not found,Author details not found,29,767,<FreqDist with 15 samples and 424 outcomes>

"US railway plan a mere copycat, hard to win favor from Middle East",Global Times,2023-05-08,"According to media reports, national security advisors from the US, India, Saudi Arabia and the UAE met in Saudi Arabia on Sunday to discuss a US proposal to link the Middle Eastern nations through a network of railway lines and connect the region to South Asia via sea lanes.US media outlet Axios, which ran an exclusive report before the talks, said, ""The project is one of the key initiatives the White House wants to push in the Middle East as China's influence in the region grows. The Middle East is a key part of China's Belt and Road vision.""Xu Liang, an associate professor at the School of International Relations, Beijing International Studies University, told the Global Times that the US is trying to coordinate its Middle East policy with its South Asia policy, thereby creating a US-style railway plan in the Middle East that is different from China's initiative. ""This is the revival of the Cold War mentality in the Middle East. The plan is a deliberate containment of China's Belt and Road Initiative,"" said Xu.China has been engaging with the Middle East through the Belt and Road Initiative for years. Its peacemaker role in the recent Saudi-Iran detente has been lauded by the international community, countries in the region in particular, and injected momentum of stability to the region. All these trajectories have deeply worried the US.The idea for the railway project germinated in the I2U2 forum 18 months ago, which includes Israel, India, the US and the UAE. Wen Jing, a postdoctoral fellow at the Center for International Security and Strategy, Tsinghua University, told the Global Times that I2U2 was relatively quiet since its formation, but after the US saw China's successful mediation in the Saudi-Iran deal, I2U2 is now becoming active with the discussions of the railway plan. ""I2U2, together with Quad and AUKUS, constitutes the US' global strategy to contain China,"" said Wen.  Ding Long, a professor with the Middle East Studies Institute of Shanghai International Studies University, believes that the US is saving its declining influence in the region with something it is not good at, which will make the US' rail plan hard to achieve its desired goal.According to a report released by the American Society of Civil Engineers in 2021, the US spent just over half of what was required to support infrastructure, the backbone of the economy. Even former US president Donald Trump once compared the US' crumbling infrastructure to that of a third-world country. US President Joe Biden signed a $1 trillion infrastructure bill into law at the end of 2021, while a Politico article in mid-2022 said the inflation plaguing Biden's presidency was also shrinking what's so far been his crowning legislative achievement, referring to the infrastructure bill.It is worth mentioning that the victims of the calamitous train derailment accident in East Palestine, Ohio, are still suffering. There were at least 1,164 train derailments across the US last year, according to data from the Federal Railroad Administration. Here is another startling data: The Bureau of Transportation Statistics found that 54,539 train derailments occurred in the US from 1990 to 2021, an average of 1,704 per year. If there is something that the US could export to the Middle East besides its ""democracy"" and ""freedom,"" it must be the freedom to derail.The US, the most powerful country in the world, performs so poorly in terms of railway construction and infrastructure. As it's now trying to woo Middle Eastern nations to establishment a network of railway lines, it is a mere copycat. While connectivity and win-win cooperation are in China's mind when it is promoting infrastructure, what is in the mind of the US is countering its perceived rivals and sustaining its global hegemony.""In terms of the technology and costs of building railways, no other country in the world than China has the prominent advantage. What the Middle Eastern countries want from the US is not a railway, but security. However, the US did not and could not bring security to the region, but messed up the security situation there. This is the dilemma the US is facing in the Middle East,"" said Ding.Now the Middle East is witnessing a strong wave of rapprochement. The reconciliation between Saudi Arabia and Iran under China's mediation presents an alternative vision to the Middle Eastern geopolitical scene. Qatar and Bahrain reestablished diplomatic relations. Egypt and Turkey are also mending ties. Progress is made in Yemen's peace talks. Just on Sunday, the Arab League has brought Syria back into its fold after 12 years. All these show that the US' Middle Eastern allies do not act in accordance with the US' playbook. ""They care more about their interests, and aren't following US lecturing. As their independence and autonomy is increasing, the Middle Eastern countries will not buy into US tactic of forming small cliques,"" said Ding.",OPINION,OBSERVER,Illustration: Chen Xia/Global Times,Author details not found,Author details not found,36,785,<FreqDist with 17 samples and 444 outcomes>

Global Security Initiative drives forward deeper reconciliation in Middle East,Ding Long,2023-04-26,"China's mediation diplomacy, guided by the Global Security Initiative, has provided a new path for the resolution of the Middle East conflict and injected enduring momentum for the wave of reconciliation in the region that the world is seeing now.Saudi Arabia and Iran, the two arch-rivals of the Middle East, have reconciled under the mediation of China and formally restored their diplomatic relations. Within a month since then, the Saudi-Iran rapprochement is like a key that opens the door to peace in this region. The warring parties in Yemen took a critical step toward a political solution; Bahrain and other Arab countries have restored diplomatic relations with Iran; Saudi Arabia and other Arab powers are interacting more frequently with Syria. A wave of reconciliation is also encouraging more joint efforts between China and the Middle East in pursuing peace.China's mediation in the Middle East has not stopped here. In separate phone calls with Israeli and Palestinian foreign ministers on April 17, China's State Councilor and Foreign Minister Qin Gang said China favors the two sides resuming peace talks. The Israeli-Palestinian conflict involves territory, sovereignty, refugees, and many other complex issues, which are unlikely to be simply resolved in several negotiations. In recent years, the US has deviated from the ""two-state solution"" with growing preference toward Israel, making it lose its status as a mediator for peace in the Middle East. In the absence of an international mediator, the Palestinian-Israeli situation is in danger of spiraling out of control. At this point, China hopes to play the role of an impartial mediator to promote negotiation for the short- and long-term peace between the two sides. Despite the complexity of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, China will persist in its support for a ""two-state solution"" to find a reasonable way out and implement its Global Security Initiative in the Middle East.The wave of reconciliation in the Middle East is being driven by both internal and external factors. Internally, the regional countries have paid a heavy price and are overwhelmed with strategic overextension since the Arab Spring, which has led them to desperately desire to stop conflict and seek peace. Externally, the role of major powers in the Middle East conflict stands in sharp contrast to the wave of reconciliation. Compared with the policy that generates confrontation, China's mediation diplomacy has provided a new path for the resolution of the Middle East conflict, as well as a reference for the war in Yemen and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Moreover, the wave of reconciliation has exposed the negative role of the US in the region. After years of conflict, Middle Eastern countries have gradually realized that their conflicts are not innate or insurmountable. The US pursuit of hegemony in the Middle East and deliberately prolonging conflicts constitute the important source of long-term geopolitical confrontation in this region. The US-led strategic contraction from the Middle East and its weakened security commitments have made Middle Eastern countries pursue higher strategic autonomy and a willingness for regional peace. The fact that ""a step back from the US military is a step forward in Middle East reconciliation"" is a phenomenon worthy of deeper reflection by US allies.While the vast majority of the world has welcomed the long-overdue geopolitical détente in the Middle East and appreciated China's positive role, the US seems to be sitting on the thorns. The US looks at the new situation in the Middle East from the perspective of major power competition, and believes that the relationship between major powers in the region is a zero-sum game, and China is filling the gap left by it.Under the Saudi-Iran agreement, the Middle East has seen a thriving situation of unity and prosperity. However, the continuation of the ""reconciliation wave"" and the resolution of regional hotspots still face various challenges. First, the Middle East conflicts are so complicated and deep-rooted that it is hard to get a one-time solution in the short term. Second, the foundation of reconciliation is fragile. Mutual trust is far from enough between Middle Eastern countries after years of conflict, let alone the lack of economic integration and common interests. Besides, there are internal and external forces against reconciliation. Some countries are still trying to undermine the reconciliation process in this region. Finally, the modern state system is not yet complete in this region. Middle Eastern countries are still oscillating between the rigidity caused by strongman politics and the turmoil caused by political transformation. The recent outbreak of civil conflict in Sudan shows that there is a long way to go for peace and stability in the Middle East, which requires the joint efforts of the international community in the ""Beijing spirit"" conveyed by the Saudi-Iran reconciliation.The author is a professor at the Middle East Studies Institute of Shanghai International Studies University. opinion@globaltimes.com.cn",OPINION,VIEWPOINT,Illustration: Xia Qing/GT,Author details not found,Author details not found,36,772,<FreqDist with 14 samples and 439 outcomes>

Leakage reveals young Americans’ distrust toward US values,Anthony Moretti,2023-04-25,"A few weeks ago, Jack Teixeira was just another young adult in the US. He was a 21-year-old member of the Massachusetts Air National Guard who had a presence on social media. Overnight, Teixeira became a household name when he was identified as the man accused in the latest classified documents leak.  The legacy of leakers in the US is well known. The full force of the political elites, joined by many in the mainstream media, will coalesce around one conclusion: The leaker is a traitor to the country, someone who has damaged national security. Anyone who dares tell the world about the seedy parts of the US government faces the wrath of the elites, and those elites want to deflect attention from the information in the leak and instead condemn the person who has revealed truth.Daniel Ellsberg, responsible for the Pentagon Papers release in the 1970s, knows that. He could have spent years in jail but a judge ruled that government overreach into its investigation of Ellsberg meant that all charges against him had to be thrown out.Edward Snowden knows that. A decade ago, Snowden exposed the rampant, and unconstitutional, effort by the US government to surveil American citizens and global political leaders. Convinced that he stood no chance at a fair trial, Snowden left the US and is now a naturalized Russian citizen.It is too soon to determine the scope of, and the fallout associated with, what Teixeira did. For now, we know that the documents he allegedly leaked pertain primarily to military affairs, with the most damning leaks suggesting the US spied on the leaders of Ukraine, South Korea and Israel, all key American allies.As Teixeira's story unfolds in the coming months, one issue cannot be ignored, although it is not likely to generate significant coverage in the US media -- the distrust that young people, Americans in the same age bracket as Teixeira, have in their government and other institutions. In a survey last year, the progressive think tank The Next 100 partnered with The GenForward Survey to review young adults' opinions of the government. Two findings stand out: First, black respondents were especially disconnected from the government and the country, and all respondents, regardless of demographics, had low trust toward the federal government.A November 2022 survey from the Ronald Reagan Institute found trust and confidence in the US military stands at 48 percent, down from 70 percent in November 2018. A retired Navy SEAL sounded the alarm about a declining number of young men and women willing to serve in the US military, according to Fox News on Sunday. Perhaps the most important warning sign here is that if young adults in the US do not feel an attachment to the fundamental institutions of society -- government, business, police, media and more -- then they might feel no reason to participate in or support them throughout their lives. For example, they could opt to not vote or to not be engaged in civil society. Moreover, this generation, which has grown up with its eyes glued to a smartphone and its thumbs banging out one text after another, has shown at best a tolerance, at worst a desire, for a social and information life delivered to them through algorithms. To stop and ask for facts and truths in such an environment could lead to being defined as weird. Ostracism comes along quickly after that. Real conversations with real people about real topics? A tuned-out generation -- with some pockets of it eager to spend time on some platforms that thrive on delivering messages of hate about people of Hispanic, African or Asian heritage -- will not only show zero interest in engaging in society, but it will also seek comfort in a dangerous social media-driven universe that profits off ideologies and ideas anathema to American values. We know that one reason Donald Trump succeeded as a politician in 2016 was because he preyed on people's insecurities and fears. Millions of men and women -- of all ages -- found their hero in a man who did not care at all for their wellbeing. Unwilling to listen to hard truths about their hero, they voted for him. Millions of them did twice. And a small percentage of them accepted his call to violence and almost succeeded in undermining democratic norms on a cold January day in 2021. Now, imagine if the next generation sees little reason to protect even more of those country's values.Crazy talk?

"Poland, Israel: ambassadors commemorate Warsaw Ghetto Uprising",Global Times,2023-04-20,"To commemorate the 80th anniversary of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising, the Polish Ambassador to China, Wojciech Zajaczkowski, and the Israeli Ambassador to China Irit Ben-Abba Vitale gathered at the Polish Embassy in Beijing on April 19 to pay tribute to the victims of the Holocaust. They wore yellow daffodils as a symbol of remembrance. The flower holds a special meaning in relation to the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising. Marek Edelman, the last surviving leader of the uprising, received a bouquet of yellow daffodils every year on April 19 from an anonymous person. He would place them at the Monument to the Ghetto Heroes in memory of those who fought and lost their lives during the uprising. Inspired by Edelman's tradition, people now wear yellow paper daffodils on this day to honor the victims.Edelman, who remained in Poland after the war, passed away in 2009, but his legacy lives on. The ceremony held in Beijing by the two embassies serves as a reminder of the atrocities of the Holocaust and the importance of never forgetting the victims.

Time for Australia to make rational calculations on how to adapt to Asian century,Kishore Mahbubani,2023-04-21," It is understandable that Australian leaders may feel insecure, even paranoid, about Australia's future in the Asian twenty-first century. As Western power recedes from the world - especially from East Asia - Australia and New Zealand will be left stranded as lonely Western outposts in Asia.But it's fatal to find emotionally comfortable solutions to difficult geopolitical challenges. This is the fundamental problem with AUKUS. It provides comfort by creating new bonds with one's old Anglo-Saxon brothers. It doesn't address Australia's strategic dilemmas.Since Australia's friends and allies are far away, it makes sense for Australia (unlike Canada) to develop a strong domestic defence capability for deterrence. Similarly, it makes sense for Australia to preserve its alliance with the US. But the UK? In 1950, the UK was the third-largest economy in the world. By 2050, it will struggle to be in the top ten. And when Britain feels that its domestic needs are more important than distant alliances, it drops those allies. It's no secret that both Australia and Singapore were abandoned in World War II. And that Britain shut down its naval base in Singapore in 1968 when budgetary pressures increased. It's always a mistake to bet on the past. Better to bet on the future.There's no question that Australia's most important neighbour for the next hundred years will be Indonesia. Australia will have to develop a close relationship with Indonesia (and its other ASEAN neighbours). And this is what makes the AUKUS decision so dangerous - Australia has sent a signal that it's not going to work on enhancing its security by working more closely with its neighbours.  Indonesia clearly felt that Australia was poking it in the eye. In response to the AUKUS deal, it used diplomatic language such as, ""Indonesia stresses the importance of Australia's commitment to continue meeting all of its nuclear non-proliferation obligations"" and ""Indonesia calls on Australia to maintain its commitment towards regional peace, stability and security in accordance with the Treaty of Amity and Cooperation."" Since the Javanese are always understated in expressing their concerns, such clear statements register the extent of Indonesia's unease over AUKUS.Many Labor leaders in Australia, in the past, have understood that it would be unwise for the country to emerge as an Israel in its region. By doing so, Australia would be militarily strong but politically isolated and psychologically insecure for the long term. Hence, for several decades, Australia has wisely cultivated close relations with ASEAN and tried to swim in the same direction. I experienced this personally in the mid-1990s when I served as the permanent secretary of the Singapore Foreign Ministry. At that time, we were working on the idea of a community of twelve, including the ten ASEAN countries and Australia and New Zealand. This would have brought Australia closer to South-East Asia, providing a gentle geopolitical buffer for Australia. Since then, Australia and ASEAN have drifted further apart in their management of geopolitical challenges. While most ASEAN countries have generally improved their relations with China, Australia's ties with China, despite recent improvements, remain fraught with tension. AUKUS isn't designed to protect Australia today. It is designed to protect Australia in the middle of this century. And what will the world look like in 2050? In one possible scenario, the US could still be the number one power in the world, with the strongest military capability in East Asia. If this happens, Australia will be well-protected. In a second scenario, which seems more likely, China will emerge as the leading economic power in the world, with the strongest military capability in East Asia, and the US will reduce its foreign entanglements and diminish its presence in East Asia.This is the fundamental problem with AUKUS. For $368 billion, Australia will be more secure in a favourable world in which the United States is still number one. Yet, for the same amount of money, Australia will feel less secure in a world in which China emerges as number one. China need not project its power militarily. Its political and economic influence will be enormous. In symbolic terms, Australia could well become like Cuba: a fiercely independent country that refuses to bend to the will of the dominant regional power but is politically isolated from most of its neighbours. The ASEAN states have carefully tried to maintain good ties with both the United States and China. But the approach taken by ASEAN states doesn't mean they are destined to kowtow to Beijing. For example, they have stood firm on their draft of a Code of Conduct for the South China Sea. At the same time, they have been enhancing their economic ties with China and working to develop a mutually beneficial relationship.It's unlikely that Australia will only have extreme choices, such as becoming an Israel or Cuba in East Asia. Fortunately, Australia is well integrated into the region's economy. It has wisely joined all the major regional trading arrangements, including the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership and the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership. Yet, if Australia continues to swim in a different geopolitical direction from others in the region, it will be perceived to be drifting away from its neighbourhood and will become psychologically isolated.What's truly shocking about Australia is that its knowledge and understanding of its immediate neighbourhood is remarkably poor. Australia has no idea what a powerful partner ASEAN could be. Many in Canberra, for example, celebrate Australia's current closeness with Japan in the Quad. Japan's economy was eight times bigger than ASEAN's in 2000. However, it's now only 1.5 times bigger. By 2030, ASEAN's economy will be bigger than Japan's.By working with AUKUS partners, such as the UK, or with Japan, Australia is betting on the past. It's certain that the future will be different. The time has come for Australia to make cold and rational calculations on how to adapt to this Asian century, which will bear no resemblance to the American century. AUKUS is a walk back to the past, not the future.Kishore Mahbubani is a distinguished fellow at the Asia Research Institute, National University of Singapore, whose books include The Asian 21st Century and Has China Won?",OPINION,VIEWPOINT,"Opera Kitchen is still closed in Sydney, Australia, May 27, 2020.(Photo: Xinhua)",Author details not found,Author details not found,59,997,<FreqDist with 20 samples and 537 outcomes>
The rapprochement momentum in the Middle East will help decrease US’ destructive role in the region: vice president of Tehran University,Xie Wenting and Bai Yunyi,2023-04-19,"Editor's Note:The Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Nasser Kanaani said on April 17 that Iran and Saudi Arabia will exchange mutual visits, including high-level ones, as part of the two countries' efforts to fully restore bilateral ties, in line with agreements to expand cooperation. Since the Saudi-Iran deal brokered by China on March 10, the two countries have headed steadily toward the restoration of bilateral ties, which is widely hailed in the international community for bringing peace to the long period of turbulence in the Middle East. Since the historic deal was inked, the region has witnessed a growing trend of countries' rapprochement and cooperation. Why did Iran and Saudi Arabia trust China in playing a mediating role? What is the influence of the rapprochement trend on the region and the world order? The Global Times reporters Xie Wenting and Bai Yunyi (GT) talked to the Vice President of the University of Tehran and Member of Iran's Presidential Delegation to China, Professor Mohammad Marandi (Marandi) on these topics and more.


GT: From your point of view, what are the reasons behind Iran and Saudi Arabia's trust in China's role as a peace mediator?Marandi: There are a host of reasons at play. First, China, unlike the US, does not involve itself in the internal affairs of other countries. The US, whenever it wants to play the role of an honest broker, it, in reality, simply manipulates the situation. It manipulates [parties] for its own gains and benefits. China, under this and other circumstances, has shown itself to be very careful not to interfere in the internal affairs of other countries. And that's what made it a much more suitable host. This helped to bring about an environment for the resolution of problems.In addition to that, I think it's the sheer weakness of the US that allowed this agreement to be reached. The US betrays and turns against its own friends. Therefore, many countries across the globe know that simply being a friend of the US or even being an ally of the US does not mean that they will be protected.GT: How do you evaluate the recent progress in the Saudi-Iran rapprochement? How do you evaluate the role that China has played in this historic deal to promote peace between the two countries?Marandi: I think that the role that the Chinese government has played is a constructive and substantial one. The Iraqi government also played a role before the Chinese government got involved and some progress was made at the negotiating table between Iran and Saudi Arabia.Fortunately, in Beijing, the two sides were able to reach an agreement. I think it will hopefully be the beginning of a much better situation in West Asia, especially in the Gulf region. This is something that the US does not want to see. The US wants to keep West Asia divided. They want to keep Iran and Saudi Arabia, among other countries, separated from one another, and to keep the Saudi government dependent on the US.

Iran’s Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian (left) and Saudi Foreign Affairs Minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan (right) attend a meeting with members of their delegations, in Beijing on April 6, 2023, paving the way for normalized ties under a China-brokered deal. GT: How would you summarize the regional political transformation after this historical deal was made? In your opinion, what are the more long-term geopolitical influences on the region and even on the global order to follow?Marandi: It's still quite early to say. There are still many issues across the region. The US continues to support apartheid in Palestine. The US still has influence in many countries across the region and Western powers have dominated much of this region for hundreds of years.However, since the US is on the decline, and momentum has been created by this rapprochement between Saudi Arabia and Iran which is significant, the hope is that the two countries can have an improved relationship. This momentum itself will help decrease the destructive role of the US in this region, so that people can live a better life.For the last few decades, the West has destroyed much of our region. Hopefully, with the decline of Western power and the convergence of countries across the region, we will have a better future for our children, our grandchildren, and for generations to come.

Professor Mohammad Marandi, vice president of the University of Tehran and member of Iran’s presidential delegation to China Photo: screenshot of GT’s video interview with MarandiGT: How will the recent development between Saudi Arabia and Iran, and the recent regional political transformation affect China and its role in the Middle East as well as on the global stage?Marandi: China will benefit from it. China is a country that has significant interests in West Asia. The rise of Asia means that West Asia, East Asia, and the rest of Asia have to integrate and it's important for Asia and Eurasia to integrate. The Gulf region is the center of energy exports and a key part of the world as well. Therefore, we need a better political, socialand economic environment.The improved relationship among countries in the Gulf region and the decreased role of the US in the West Asia is good for the region as well as for countries like China.The US thrives on division and it needs division in order to maintain its dominance and hegemony. It also does this in the South China Sea. Therefore, it is highly important to prevent the US from playing on divisions, whether it's in East Asia or West Asia.GT: What implications will the restoration of diplomatic relations between Saudi Arabia and Iran have on the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO)?Marandi: Just as the improved relationship has a positive influence across the West Asian region, it definitely has a positive impact on other parts of Asia as well. So the members of the SCO will benefit from this improved relationship, because it will not only help improve the economic situation, but will also contribute to the improvement of the security situation.We have to remember that the US has been using countries in the region to promote extremists and extremist groups, which have been a problem for the last few decades. So the less influence the US has on the region, the better countries can deal with extremist groups.GT: How do you view the prospect of Iran and Saudi Arabia joining the BRICS?Marandi: I think it is possible that both Iran and Saudi Arabia will join the BRICS. Western countries and the G7 hope to dominate the global economy and the decision-making process as they have done over past decades. While the Global South, the vast majority of the international community, believes that they must have an equal say, if not a greater say, because of their sheer numbers in how the global economy is managed. Therefore, it is important for the BRICS to have new members from the Global South that are powerful and influential.GT: The de-dollarization process is ongoing in several parts of the world, especially in the petroleum industry. What's your take on it?Marandi: De-dollarization is very important for the international community, because the dollar has been used as a weapon by the US against different countries. It is unreliable and it is dangerous.Therefore, countries like China, Iran, and Russia among many others, need to move away from the dollar so that the US cannot use it as a weapon against them, whether it's because of politics or because of trade and business, and high tech industry advances. The US should not be allowed to use the dollar to put pressure on other countries.Iran already sells a substantial amount of petroleum using currencies other than the US dollar.I think for Saudi Arabia, ultimately it will be in its best interests to move away from the dollar as well in order to make sure that it is not vulnerable or less vulnerable to the US.If the rapprochement continues, then I think the chances for Saudi Arabia to join the camp of de-dollarization increases substantially.Since China is a major energy importer from the Gulf region, it would be ideal for China to be able to use China's yuan to import energy from the region.",IN-DEPTH,DIPLOMATIC CHANNEL,Photo: VCG,Author details not found,Author details not found,56,1353,<FreqDist with 19 samples and 698 outcomes>
"China continues reconciliation efforts in Middle East despite US’ meddling, shows greater role in global governance",Fan Anqi,2023-04-18,"After the successfully brokered deal between decades-old rivalries Iran and Saudi Arabia that saw the restoration of ties in March, China is continuing its reconciliation efforts in the Middle East in settling the Yemen crisis and promoting Israel-Palestine peace talks. China's rising influence in global governance is in stark contrast to a decline in that of the US, whose claims of promoting peace serve only its own selfish interests which eventually resulted in greater rifts between civilizations in the region.Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Qin Gang on Monday said that China encourages both Israel and Palestine to show political courage and take steps to resume peace talks, and China is ready to provide convenience for this, he noted in a phone call with Israeli Foreign Minister Eli Cohen.Qin said China is concerned about the current tension between Israel and Palestine, and the current priority is to bring the situation under control and prevent the conflict from escalating or even getting out of control.""It is never too late to do the right thing,"" the Chinese foreign minister said, adding that all parties should remain calm and restrained, and stop excessive and provocative words and deeds. The fundamental way out is to resume peace talks and implement the ""two-state solution.""Also on Monday, Geng Shuang, China's deputy permanent representative to the United Nations, said that the political process in Yemen has maintained good momentum, and China welcomes all parties concerned maintaining communication on the resumption of the truce.  Saudi Arabia, Oman and other regional countries are making positive efforts to ease the situation in Yemen and achieve a permanent cease-fire, Geng noted. The Chinese envoy said that the resumption of diplomatic ties between Saudi Arabia and Iran is of great significance for strengthening regional solidarity and cooperation and easing regional tensions. It has also set a good example for dialogue and consultation, and served as excellent practice for promoting the China-proposed Global Security Initiative.China's role in mediating conflicts in the region is constructive and unique, as China not only provides a platform for dialogue with a full range of resources but also a moderate and pluralistic atmosphere for the talks, experts said.China's mediating role is highlighted in a number of factors. For one thing, China's proposal of the Global Security Initiative, Global Development Initiative and Global Security Initiative as well as the concept of building a global community of a shared future, which advocates a multipolar world, are more in line with the values of Middle East countries.In terms of practical actions, China has shown an objective and neutral stance on international hot-button issues, including those in the Middle East, on the Afghanistan issue, and on the Russia-Ukraine conflict, Zhu Yongbiao, director of the Center for Afghanistan Studies at Lanzhou University, told the Global Times on Tuesday. In addition, the current complex international situation, with rising tensions and risks, has given countries in the region the anxieties and eagerness to seek stability and development, Zhu noted. The talks come at a time of rising tensions in the region. In Israel, clashes at the al-Aqsa mosque in Jerusalem earlier this month drew condemnation from Arab countries. Saudi Arabia, with whom Israel hopes to normalize ties, said Israel's ""storming"" of al-Aqsa undermined peace efforts, the Guardian reported.  The overlapping of Ramadan and Passover this April has increased the possibility of friction as Jerusalem hosts an unusually large influx of pilgrims. More people are worried that the latest clashes could ignite a powder keg in the region and block the road to peace and stability.The Israeli-Palestinian conflict is a multi-faceted and complex issue, but the biggest obstacle to peace talks at present is that some Israeli politicians still do not want to change their hard-line attitude toward the Palestinians and are unwilling to see its dominant position fade, while the US is fanning the flames to exacerbate the conflict, observers noted. In contrast to China's reconciliation efforts, US claims of ""returning peace to the Middle East"" is more of a lip service that serves its geopolitical goals, Zhu said. ""In a way, the US indeed wants to achieve peace in the region, but the premise is that such 'peace' must be the one that serves its own interests. The US dominance in the region, highlighting monopoly and exclusion, is based on the interests of its own and its allies, while ignoring the legitimate and rightful interests of other parties. The selfish acts only made things worse, further widening the rift between civilizations in the region,"" the expert noted.",CHINA,DIPLOMACY,"Chinese Foreign Minister Qin Gang attends a press conference on China's foreign policy and foreign relations on the sidelines of the first session of the 14th National People's Congress (NPC) in Beijing, capital of China, March 7, 2023.

People on streets, in stores and cafes stopped their activities and stood still in honor of the Jewish victims.The solemn commemoration began on Monday at nightfall at Yad Vashem, Israel's Holocaust memorial museum, attended by President Isaac Herzog and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.It continued on Tuesday with ceremonies in the Knesset, the Israeli parliament, as well as schools and other public venues throughout the country.At the Yad Vashem ceremony, a group of six survivors lit torches in memory of the 6 million killed in the Holocaust.In his speech, Herzog called on Israelis to set aside their differences and unite ahead of a week of national mourning, following weeks of violence and protests over the divisive government's judicial overhaul plan. Next week, Israel will mark its Memorial Day for fallen soldiers, followed by its 75th Independence Day the next day.""Let us leave these sacred days, which begin tonight and end on Independence Day, above all dispute,"" Herzog said. ""Let us all come together, as always, in partnership, in grief, in remembrance.""Following the siren, Netanyahu, Herzog, Speaker of the Knesset Amir Ohana and other officials laid wreaths in Yad Vashem to commemorate the Holocaust victims.During World War II, victims of the Holocaust were systematically rounded up, transported to concentration and extermination camps, and subjected to forced labor, starvation, and gas chambers.According to figures released by Israel's Central Bureau of Statistics on Monday, at the end of 2022, the number of Jewish holocaust survivors living in Israel was about 147,199",PHOTO,WORLD,"People stand in silence as a siren sounds to commemorate Jewish Holocaust victims in Jerusalem, on April 18, 2023.

China’s autonomous driving companies mull to build smarter cars,Global Times,2023-04-18,"Baidu, a Chinese technology with strong internet foundations, recently released a series of new products covering intelligent driving, intelligent cabins and intelligent maps, striking deeper collaboration between smart driving solutions and smart chipsets, which will further accelerate the smart manufacturing of China's automotive industry.The Black Sesame Semiconductor will become the latest chip partner to Baidu Apollo Smart Driving, said Baidu. Additionally, Apollo Highway Driving Pro will be deployed on the Black Sesame's Huashan II A1000 chip computing platform, which will be officially released in the third quarter of this year. China's auto industry is experiencing radical changes. Baidu predicts that by 2026, the market penetration rate of models equipped with the L2+ advanced intelligent driving solution, valet parking highway navigation pilot and city navigation pilot will exceed 15 percent, ushering in a transition period in intelligent vehicle industry. In addition, Baidu Apollo has upgraded its autonomous parking solution, which has a success rate of 99 percent in the top five most commonly faced parking scenarios. Besides, it only takes 28 seconds to complete perpendicular parking, drastically reducing the difficulty of parking for novice drivers.Earlier on April 11, Zhang Kai, chairman of Haomo.AI, said that the HPilot 3.0 system, which can provide urban assisted driving systems, will be launched this year.Zhang said the system has been equipped with nearly 20 models. The user-assisted driving mileage has already exceeded 40 million kilometers, and the average daily mileage utilization rate of HPilot2.0 assisted driving was 12.6 percent. In terms of overseas usage, vehicles equipped with HPilot system have been exported to the EU and Israel. At the same time, the Mexican version and the Russian version will be mass-produced, and will be launched in the Middle East, South Africa and Australia, according to Zhang. For autonomous driving companies, in addition to technical upgrades, the mass production of autonomous driving pre-installation has also become the main direction for each major company.In 2022, the pre-installation rate of high-level assisted driving of passenger cars in the Chinese market reached 29.40 percent, and 5,859,900 vehicles will be delivered with pre-installed standard equipment, according to Haomo.AI.Zhang said that by 2025, the rate of high-level assisted driving will exceed 70 percent, which means that starting from this year, smart driving products will have entered a period of rapid growth.Chinese electric vehicle start-up Xpeng announced in September of last year that it has launched the pilot program of City Navigation Guided Pilot (NGP), making it the first Chinese auto company to launch such high-level Advanced Driver Assistance System functions for complex urban driving scenarios.When City NGP is activated with a set destination, the vehicle itself can perform the full range of driving tasks such as cruising with a safe distance from leading vehicles, changing lanes due to navigation or vehicle overtaking decision and maintaining an appropriate speed throughout the driving route.China's autonomous vehicles market is projected to reach $98.89 billion by 2030. Self-driving cars could lead China's automotive industry into a position of global strength. From automated cargo trucks to driverless taxis, autonomous vehicles will change the nature of on-road driving and, in the process, revolutionize the mobility and automotive industries, according to researchandmarkets.com.Global Times",SOURCE,ECONOMY,"A man sits in an autonomous driving vehicle on a pilot road in Guangzhou, South China's Guangdong Province on March 1 of 2021.

"China reviews US cyber attack cases, saying US owes explanation over leaked Pentagon docs",Global Times,2023-04-12,"The US owes the international community an explanation over the leaked Pentagon documents as they clearly show that the US has long used its tech edge to conduct indiscriminate secret theft, surveillance and eavesdropping on countries in the world, including its allies, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said on Wednesday, reveals five typical cases of cyber attacks conducted by the US government.Wang's remarks came after the online leaking of a set of highly classified Pentagon documents in recent weeks, which have exposed the extent of US eavesdropping on key allies, including South Korea, Israel and Ukraine.These cases show once again that the US is the origin of cyber warfare, the biggest spreader of advanced cyber weapons and the biggest global cyber thief, said Wang after listing cases picked out of a report released by China Cybersecurity Industry Alliance on Tuesday.The report uncovered cyber attacks, surveillance and secret thefts carried out by US intelligence agencies.  According to Wang, In 2010, the US was found using the Stuxnet virus to attack Iran's nuclear facilities. This is the first case in history where a government launched cyber attacks against key infrastructure of other countries. In 2013, the media exposed that the US National Institute of Standards and Technology uses its cryptography standards to install backdoors, which expands the targets of supply chain attacks from IT products to IT standards.Wang also mentioned the ""PRISM incident"" in 2013, which revealed how the US engaged in cyber espionage across the world, including against China, the US' ""Project CAMBERDADA"" in 2015  which is aimed to intrude, divide and suppress foreign cybersecurity vendors and force them to dance to the tune of the US, and  the ransomware WannaCry that affected most countries and caused the most severe losses across the world in 2017, which was the result of leaked cyber weapons from the US National Security Agency.Despite this record of cyber attacks, Wang said the US has been citing digital security as an excuse to suppress Chinese companies without providing any evidence, and it even coerced its allies who were also victims of US espionage to join the gang.The so-called Clean Network and what the US calls ""technology that reflects democratic values and interests"" are just a pretext for it to unscrupulously conduct cyber thefts and attacks and ensure its supremacy. The US has been holding other countries to high standards, but clearly these standards mean little to the US itself. This is textbook double standards, Wang noted.Calling the leak of highly classified Pentagon documents ""another PRISM incident,"" Chinese experts on Tuesday said it gives a rare chance to glimpse into how the US spies on its allies, which will exacerbate the lack of strategic mutual trust between them and deal a heavy blow to Washington's strategy of maintaining global hegemony.",CHINA,DIPLOMACY,Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Wang Wenbin Photo: VCG,Author details not found,Author details not found,13,451,<FreqDist with 15 samples and 270 outcomes>
"Pentagon file leak ‘exacerbates lack of mutual trust between US and allies, a heavy blow to US hegemony’",Fan Anqi,2023-04-11,"Calling the leak of highly classified Pentagon documents ""another PRISM incident,"" Chinese experts on Tuesday said it gives a rare chance to glimpse into how the US spies on its allies, which will exacerbate the lack of strategic mutual trust between them and deal a heavy blow to Washington's strategy of maintaining global hegemony.A top Pentagon spokesperson said Monday that the leak of the files presents a ""very serious"" risk to US national security, which has deeply rattled US officials, who fear the revelations could ""jeopardize sensitive sources and compromise important foreign relationships,"" CNN reported.The classified files first began to appear on Discord in late February, and later spread to other social media sites, including Telegram and Twitter. It was not until The New York Times reported about the material on April 6 that Pentagon chief Lloyd Austin was briefed on the issue.Pentagon deputy press secretary Sabrina Singh noted on Sunday that the documents circulating on social media sites ""appear to contain sensitive and highly classified material."" In addition to highly detailed information that divulge key weaknesses of Ukraine at a critical point on the battlefield - Kiev's much-anticipated ""spring counteroffensive,"" some of the leaked documents are said to have exposed the extent of US eavesdropping on key allies, including South Korea, Israel and Ukraine.Ukraine has already altered some of its military plans because of the leak, a source close to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said. A senior intelligence official called the leak ""a nightmare for the Five Eyes,"" in a reference to the US, UK, Australia, New Zealand and Canada, the so-called Five Eyes nations that broadly share intelligence, The New York Times reported.In an attempt to sooth anxious nerves, US State Department spokesperson Vedant Patel on Monday told reporters they are engaging with allies and partners at high levels over the matter, and are working on reassuring them of US' commitment to safeguarding intelligence and ""the fidelity"" of the partnerships.Experts said the leak could pose a profound and complicated impact on ties between US and its allies, especially on intelligence and security cooperation. Yang Xiyu, a senior research fellow at the China Institute of International Studies, told the Global Times on Tuesday that the incident will further add to dissatisfaction with the US among its allies, and most importantly, exacerbate the lack of strategic mutual trust between them. ""While knowing that their security interests are highly tied to that of the US, allies are coming to realize that the relationship with Washington is more of a domination and subordination. To satisfy its own selfish needs, the US is threatening the security of its allies through spying on their intelligence by any means necessary,"" Yang noted. Calling the leak ""another PRISM incident,"" Chinese military expert Song Zhongping noted that for one thing, it exposes a huge loophole in America's national security, and for another, it deals a significant blow to US intelligence authorities, which would become a major shortcoming that affects the cooperation with its allies. ""The distrust and disunity spurred by the incident is a heavy blow to the US' strategy of maintaining global hegemony. US hegemony will only decline day by day without the strategic support of its allies,"" Song told the Global Times. As the incident sends shockwaves across the White House, National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby said there are concerns there could be additional leaks. ""We don't know who is behind this. We don't know the motive. And we don't know what else is out there,"" he said, reported VOA. The leak of classified documents reveals the tearing of different voices and values within the US. Many are dissatisfied with Washington's policy that both harms the interests of its own and the common welfare of countries around the world, and such outrage over the government's abuse of power in overseas and domestic operations has accumulated to a point that eventually led to the leak, Li Haidong, a professor at the China Foreign Affairs University, told the Global Times on Tuesday.",CHINA,DIPLOMACY,"South Korean people protest outside the US Embassy in Seoul on April 11, 2023, after leaked documements show US has been spying on its major allies in Asia.

"Leaked US, NATO documents on Ukraine’s military operation show ‘serious disunity within the West’",Yang Sheng,2023-04-09,"The recent leak of classified US and NATO documents on the Ukrainian military and Kiev's much-anticipated ""spring counteroffensive"" has exposed that disunity, distrust and divergences among the US, the West and Ukraine are serious and keep worsening, said Chinese experts. They noted that the incident further proves that Washington is the biggest obstacle for the international community to promote a cease-fire and peace talks for the ongoing Ukraine crisis.   According to US media, the US Department of Justice has opened an investigation into the leak that was posted on social media in recent weeks.CNN reported on Saturday that the investigation comes as new documents surfaced Friday covering everything from US support for Ukraine to information about key US allies like Israel, widening the fallout from the already alarming leak. The Pentagon on Thursday said it was looking into the matter after social media posts of apparently classified documents on the war in Ukraine had emerged.""They look real,"" a US official told CNN about the leaked documents. CNBC News also reported on Saturday that the documents that appeared online ""are likely real"" and ""the result of a leak,"" but that some of the documents may have been altered before they were posted, a senior US official said on Saturday.Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said in a statement on Telegram that the leak is a ""Russian information operation"" and does not reveal Kiev's ""actual operational plans,"" the Financial Times reported on Sunday.A Chinese expert on international security and intelligence who asked for anonymity told the Global Times on Sunday that ""the leak is unlikely caused by Russian intelligence agencies, because this does not make sense."" If Russia has obtained these classified documents, it would not post them online, because this will make Russia lose the source or sources that had provided these documents, he said. He noted that there is no reason for Russia to let its enemies know that it has obtained this intelligence, because this will also make its enemies change plans, making the hard-won military intelligence useless. Song Zhongping, a Chinese military expert and TV commentator, said that the leaked documents expose ""many disadvantages and shortcomings of Ukrainian military forces. This is absolutely not good news for Ukraine.""The leak, the source of which remains unknown, reveals the US' assessment of a Ukrainian military that is itself in dire straits, The New York Times reported on Saturday. The leaked material, from late February and early March but found on social media sites in recent days, outlines ""critical shortages of air defense munitions"" and discusses ""the gains being made by Russian troops around the eastern city of Bakhmut."" Ukrainian presidential advisor Podolyak said the documents provided only a ""statistical analysis of supplies, possible operational and tactical plans, as well as a large volume of fictitious information.""Whether the leak is real or not, they have wrought damage on Kiev. Even if these documents contain fictitious information, they will damage the morale of the Ukrainian military and the confidence of Western countries in continuing to support Kiev to win the fight against Moscow. The response of the Ukrainian official shows that Kiev is nervous, and the US investigation proves the incident is very serious, said experts.The above-quoted anonymous expert said that it is still a question that who leaked these documents online, but based on the reactions of the relevant parties, it was probably caused by the disunity within the US. ""Democrats and Republicans have long-existing divergences on the price that Washington should pay for supporting Kiev to fight Moscow. Many US policymakers are losing faith to completely defeat Moscow, so they might want to use the leak to ruin the existing plan of supporting Ukraine and to decrease the US inputs in the new plan,"" he noted. If the old plan of a ""spring counteroffensive"" cannot be executed, and the inputs from the US decrease, this will further shake the determination of other NATO members in Europe to keep their support, said experts. In other words, disunity, divergence and distrust among the US, Ukraine and NATO have been exposed by the leak and will keep worsening, they noted.  Song said the incident will also damage ties between the US and its allies around the globe. Countries that have military cooperation with the US will be worried that the US is unable to keep their secrets and will even spy on them and leak their secrets to the media or online, Song noted. The New York Times reported on Saturday that the leaked intelligence reports seem to indicate that ""the United States is also spying on Ukraine's top military and political leaders, a reflection of Washington's struggle to get a clear view of Ukraine's fighting strategies.""""Just like the PRISM program leaked by Edward Snowden has proved, the US is spying on its allies, whether close or not, and this is how the US keeps its hegemony,"" Song told the Global Times on Sunday. ""More importantly, the US doubts Ukraine's determination to keep up the fight."" Washington hopes Kiev and its NATO allies to maintain the conflict at all costs and it wants an unrealistic and costly result - a complete defeat of Russia. But maybe Ukraine, after having suffered from huge amount of casualties without meaningful progress on the battlefield, wants to seek the possibility of a cease-fire and solve its problems with Russia via talks. This is why the US is spying on Ukraine, said experts, adding that it just once again proves that Washington is the biggest obstacle for a political and peaceful solution for the crisis.",CHINA,DIPLOMACY,US Ukraine crisis Illustration: Liu Rui/GT,"Reporter, Beijing","Yang Sheng is a chief reporter at the Global Times covering Chinese politics, diplomacy and military.",32,924,<FreqDist with 16 samples and 518 outcomes>
"China calls on Israel, Palestine to observe restraint",Liu Xin,2023-04-07,"As the international community closely watches the latest developments in the Middle East after Israel bombed the Gaza Strip and Lebanon in retaliation for several dozen rockets fired from both territories, China on Friday urged all parties, especially Israel, to observe restraint and avoid taking any actions that could further aggravate the tense situation, and also called on influential countries to take due responsibility. It is a pity to see the Israel-Palestine situation deteriorating while many regional countries are working to embrace a trend of reconciliation, analysts said, noting that China's proposals on global security, which has yielded results in promoting regional peace, will continue to play a constructive role. On Friday, Israel's military launched air attacks on southern Lebanon and the Gaza Strip in response to a spate of rocket attacks in Israel. The escalation in tensions comes after Israeli forces stormed the Al-Aqsa Mosque in occupied East Jerusalem on successive days, triggering violent confrontations with Palestinians inside and causing anger across the region, media reported.After the latest round of hostilities between Israel and Lebanon, Israeli forces continued to break up Palestinian worshippers who wanted to visit the Al-Aqsa Mosque, while a shooting attack in the occupied West Bank killed two Israeli women. Passover and Ramadan both fall in April this year. More people are worried that the latest clashes could ignite a powder keg in the region and block the road to peace and stability.  Fire and smoke are seen following an Israeli airstrike in the southern Gaza Strip city of Khan Younis on April 7, 2023. Israel on Friday intensified airstrikes on military posts in the Gaza Strip and Lebanon, in response to rockets fired from the areas at several parts in Israel, escalating tensions with Palestine over the past three days after Israeli police forcibly expelled Palestinian worshippers from the Al-Aqsa Mosque in East Jerusalem. Photo:XinhuaOn Friday morning, China's Special Envoy on the Middle East Issue Zhai Jun had a group meeting with diplomatic envoys of Arab countries upon request, during which he urged all sides to act in accordance with the relevant UN resolutions, and earnestly respect and maintain the historical status quo of the holy sites in Jerusalem, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said on Friday.The Chinese envoy noted that the fundamental way to resolve the conflict between Palestine and Israel is the implementation of the two-state solution and the establishment of an independent state of Palestine. The international community needs to act with a stronger sense of urgency, heed the legitimate concerns of Palestine and take real steps to fulfill the pledge to the Palestinian people, he said.China has actively responded to the call of regional states and asked the UN Security Council to hold emergency consultations on the Israel-Palestine situation together with countries including the UAE, and make active efforts for de-escalation. China has also been in close communication with the relevant parties in the international community to facilitate peace talks, said Zhai.The current escalation took place against the backdrop of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan and right-wing forces in Israel pushing for tougher policies toward Palestine. Also, the US' partiality toward Israel leads to an imbalance between Israel and Palestine, making it harder to mediate the conflict, Sun Degang, director of the Center for Middle Eastern Studies at Fudan University, told the Global Times on Friday.While the trend toward reconciliation has been advanced among Gulf countries in the Middle East, it is a pity to see there are no signs of improvement in the Israel-Palestine issue, with the situation in some areas getting even worse, Sun said.The international community, including China, has called for the parties concerned to discuss the issue on multilateral platforms. On Wednesday, UN Middle East envoy Tor Wennesland appealed for Israeli and Palestinian leaders to exercise restraint following the latest violence.  Sun noted that the current predicament for Israel and Palestine highlighted the fact that traditional views on security are at a dead end and related countries should get rid of their zero-sum mentality. One country should not defend its security by violating another country's security, he added.China's proposal and role on promoting a solution to the Israel-Palestine issue is important, as it has never picked sides nor sought to fill a vacuum of any country in the region or cultivate a proxy, which is why China was able to successfully mediate the restoration of diplomatic relations between Saudi Arabia and Iran, said Sun.Saudi Arabia and Iran announced the resumption of diplomatic ties in Beijing after the first formal meeting between the two countries' top diplomats in more than seven years.China's remarkable mediation between the two countries over the past month showed that its diplomatic philosophy and Chinese proposals on global security and heated issues have gained more recognition worldwide, observers said.Sun said that the reconciliation trend in the Middle East is precious and fragile at the same time, which needs all parties and the international community to work in the same direction. As China's proposal on global security has seen results in the Gulf region, it will continue to play an active role in promoting negotiations on regional issues, including the Israel-Palestine issue, Sun added.",CHINA,DIPLOMACY,"China's Special Envoy on the Middle East Issue Zhai Jun has a group meeting with diplomatic envoys in China of Arab countries upon request on April 7, 2023.

Tensions mounting in Gaza after Israel intensifies airstrikes,Xinhua,2023-04-07,"Israel on Friday intensified airstrikes on military posts in the Gaza Strip and Lebanon, in response to rockets fired from the areas at several parts in Israel, escalating tensions with Palestine over the past three days after Israeli police forcibly expelled Palestinian worshippers from the Al-Aqsa Mosque in East Jerusalem.Hamas security sources said that Israeli reconnaissance drones and fighter jets launched dozens of airstrikes on military posts and facilities that belong to the Al-Qassam Brigades, Hamas' armed wing.Palestinian residents told Xinhua that they heard the buzz of the fighter jets and drones hovering over the Hamas-controlled Gaza Strip and that bombings were heard all over the coastal enclave.Medical sources in Gaza said that no injuries were immediately reported and hospitals and clinics have declared a state of emergency and readiness to receive possible casualties.The Al-Qassam Brigades and other minor militant groups said in separate statements that their militants fired anti-craft missiles at the Israeli jets that hovered over the Gaza Strip.The joint Palestinian chamber of operations, which comprises several armed wings of Palestinian factions, including Hamas and the Islamic Jihad, said earlier that their militants ""are ready to confront any Israeli attack.""""In light of the enemy's threats to our resistance and our people in Gaza, we affirm our readiness to confront and respond with all force to any aggression and to defend our people in all places of its presence and our sanctities,"" it said in a statement.Meanwhile, an Israeli army spokesman said in a press statement that sirens were turned on in southern Israel after barrages of projectiles and rockets were fired from the Gaza Strip and that Israeli fighter jets bombed several Hamas posts and facilities in the southern, central, western and northern Gaza Strip.""The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) attacked tonight, using a remotely manned aircraft, a heavy launcher from which missiles were fired at IDF aircraft and Israeli territory,"" said the spokesman.The Israeli army on Friday confirmed that the country's air force struck southern Lebanon as Israel accused Hamas and other militant groups of being responsible for firing dozens of rockets from south Lebanon at northern Israel.The Israeli military warned that it will not permit Hamas, which runs the Gaza Strip and has a smaller presence in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, to operate from within Lebanon, and that it ""holds the state of Lebanon responsible for every directed fire emanating from its territory.""The Israeli airstrikes began as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was convening his Security Cabinet to discuss possible military responses to over 30 rockets that militants in Lebanon fired on Thursday afternoon at northern Israel.The latest escalation, which came during a sensitive holiday time as Muslims were observing the holy month of Ramadan with prayers at the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound and Jews were commemorating the Passover holiday, was triggered after Israeli had raided at the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound, the third holiest site to Muslims for two consecutive days, firing gas canisters and stun grenades at worshipers.Earlier this week, militants in Gaza fired about 20 rockets at southern Israel in a response to Israeli raids at the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound.A man checks damages caused by an Israeli airstrike in Gaza City April 7, 2023.

Those betraying people's interests will inevitably face severe punishment,Zhang Hua,2023-04-07,"Taiwan regional leader Tsai Ing-wen, who provocatively visited the US under the guise of a ""transit"" trip, on Thursday met with a bipartisan group including US House Speaker Kevin McCarthy at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in the US. This further confirms her role as a disruptor of cross-Straits peace and collaborator with external forces in betraying Taiwan island's interests. Throughout Chinese and world history, those who collaborate with outsiders to betray their own people's interests are destined to be nailed to the pillar of shame.After the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) deceived the people in Taiwan and became the ruling party in 2016, despite having learned a lesson from former Taiwan regional leader Chen Shui-bian's mistakes and not emboldened to engage in activities seeking ""de jure independence,"" it still stubbornly adheres to the so-called ""Taiwan independence"" proposition. On the one hand, it carried out activities to push for ""de-sinicization"" and illegally cracked down on pro-reunification forces in Taiwan. It on the other hand has repeatedly colluded with external forces, acted as a pawn of foreign countries, and provoked the Chinese mainland, in a bid to gain sympathy from external forces and expand its so-called ""space"" on the international stage.How do foreign forces respond to the DPP's behavior? First, Western societies such as the US constantly hype the so-called cross-Straits risks and make wild assumption about the timing of cross-Straits conflicts. Next, after stirring up trouble in the Taiwan Straits, they demand that the island improve their so-called defense capabilities, including increasing defense budgets to purchase weapons from the US.In the eyes of some ""Taiwan independence"" secessionist forces, Washington seems to have given Taiwan ""support."" For example, after the Biden administration took office, it has approved its arms sale package for Taiwan for nine times. However, after the DPP authorities paid the bill, the US delayed delivery in its arms sales to Taiwan under the excuse of limited production capability. The US Congress passed the so-called TAIPEI Act, claiming to assist Taiwan in maintaining ""diplomatic allies"" and ""international space,"" however, the island then could not participate in the World Health Assembly and the International Civil Aviation Organization, which it could attend before, and the number of ""diplomatic allies"" has also dropped by nine during Tsai's term, reaching an all-time low. What did the island of Taiwan gain from Tsai's visit to the US under the name of ""transit"" and her meeting with McCarthy? According to the logic of a ""Taiwan independence"" secessionist, this is a ""big breakthrough"" in US-Taiwan relations, because this is the highest-level official a Taiwan regional leader has ever met in the US.In fact, the Biden administration has been trying to downplay Tsai's ""transit."" McCarthy's willingness to meet Tsai Ing-wen is not only because the DPP has been lobbying with money for a long time, but also because McCarthy wants to use the Taiwan question as an important channel to unite US congressmen and seek personal benefits.In the island, the DPP has long struggled with a shortage of international talent, and they have long accepted Western discourse and lack of international insight and historical vision.From the perspective of international fluctuations, the hegemony of the US is no longer stable, and the collective rise of developing countries and the trend of multi-polarization are becoming clearer. In the context of history, the US abandoned its ""ally"" the island of Taiwan in the 1970s, and then abandoned pro-American forces in Afghanistan, Iraq and other places in this century, and now it is even making trouble with Israel. The US has always been a country that puts its interests first and there is no such thing as ""morality.""Tsai's practice of selling out Taiwan's interests has been increasingly opposed by the people on the island, and ""Americophobia"" is becoming a new trend of thought in local society. Ma Ying-jeou, former chairperson of the opposition party the Kuomintang, who advocates the recognition of the 1992 Consensus and opposes ""Taiwan independence,"" has just visited the mainland. While marveling at the tremendous achievements in economic and social development on the mainland, he has also repeatedly called for peaceful development across the Taiwan Straits instead of colluding with outsiders to undermine peace.A poll also showed that as many as 64.8 percent of netizens on the island do not care about Tsai's visit to the US, and 69.5 percent believe that her visit is not helpful to the so-called Taiwan-US relations.The author is research fellow at the Institute of Taiwan Studies of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. opinion@globaltimes.com.cn",OPINION,VIEWPOINT,Illustration: Liu Xiangya/GT,Author details not found,Author details not found,28,718,<FreqDist with 17 samples and 396 outcomes>

China's diplomacy to make 'more global contributions'; Vision on community with shared future implemented with real actions and notable results,Yang Sheng,2023-03-23,"China's diplomacy has pressed the ""accelerate button"" and sounded the clarion call in the spring of 2023 with a series of major diplomatic activities that bring positive changes to a world in turbulence. Experts said that China has formally started its new journey after the two sessions and will take on the responsibility of a major country by making more contributions to addressing concerns of the international community. Chinese President Xi Jinping just concluded his successful and significant state visit to Russia on Wednesday, bringing new hopes for a ceasefire in the Ukraine crisis. Earlier this month, senior officials from Saudi Arabia and Iran shook hands in Beijing as the two countries agreed to resume diplomatic ties following China's mediation. According to the Chinese Foreign Ministry, China's special envoys for Middle East and Afghanistan issues have also started their new missions by travelling around the globe to mediate and solve international problems such as the Palestine-Israel conflict and issues between Afghanistan and its neighboring countries in Central Asia. A decade ago, in March 2013, Xi first put forward the concept of ""a community with a shared future for mankind"" when speaking at the Moscow State Institute of International Relations. A decade later, the Chinese flagship vision is becoming a great banner for building a better, more prosperous world, said a commentary article published by the Xinhua News Agency.In the past decade, China has made efforts to promote this concept and work together with other countries around the globe to seek solutions for problems and share the benefits of development. From the Belt and Road Initiative that has brought huge development opportunities to countries all around the world, to the joint fight against the COVID-19 pandemic that saved numerous lives from the deadly virus; from conducting disaster relief and rescue operations in earthquake-hit Turkey and Syria earlier this year, to making significant contributions to UN peace keeping missions worldwide, China has always implemented its concept with concrete actions and notable achievements, said experts.Global influence These achievements and proactive activities have prompted some Western media to take note of the change in China's diplomacy. The Wall Street Journal (WSJ) published an article on Wednesday that said ""China now sees itself as a global power—and it is starting to act like one."" Domestically, China has already set its vision clearly after the 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, formally establishing a new team of leaders and new structure for Party and state institutions after the two sessions, which means China is fully prepared to march full speed ahead in its new journey of the new era, said experts. Li Haidong, a professor at the Institute of International Relations at the China Foreign Affairs University, told the Global Times on Thursday that ""the current international situation has also made China more proactive.""The world is now in a state of great turbulence, and this affects the entire international community, and unfortunately, the US, the world's only super power, chooses not to take the responsibility to fix the world, but instead uses the cracks and scars around the globe to instigate more conflicts, Li said. It's even trying to reap benefits from the chaos, which means China, a major power with strength and wisdom, has to stand up and take the responsibility of promoting peace through its actions, he added. In the coming weeks, leaders and top diplomats from many countries and international organizations are scheduled or have announced plans to visit China, including Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, French President Emmanuel Macron, and Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez. Honduras, a country that used to be an ally of the island of Taiwan, reportedly plans to send its foreign minister to visit the Chinese mainland to promote the establishment of diplomatic ties with the People's Republic of China. The Chinese Foreign Ministry on Thursday said that China welcomes the positive attitude of Honduras and is willing to develop ties with the country. Equatorial Guinea's foreign minister Simeón Oyono Esono Angue and New Zealand Foreign Minister Nanaia Mahuta are also visiting China this week. ASEAN Secretary-General Kao Kim Hourn will pay an official visit to China from March 24 to 29, according to the Chinese Foreign Ministry.This shows that the US approaches of containment, isolation and stigmatization against China have completely failed. All countries, whether they are large nations like France and Brazil or small nations like Honduras and Equatorial Guinea, all need to develop ties with China, and China also wants to build stable and equal relations with them, experts said.In particular, on matters that the world shares concerns over, like the ongoing Ukraine crisis, more and more countries find that the US and its followers have failed to bring peace and also failed to lead global recovery, Li said. They are even opposing de-escalation of the crisis and are eager to see the bloodshed being prolonged, which is why countries are now placing their expectations on China, he added.'US-centric' no moreThe WSJ article said ""China's willingness to wade into these conflicts in such a strident way marks a new phase in the country's vision for itself and its role in the world. It sends a message that China and its friends are no longer obliged to conform to a US-led global order.""Chinese analysts said that in fact, it was the US-led order that brought more troubles, unfairness, uncertainty and even danger to world peace and global recovery, so more and more members of the international community, including China, believe that it's time to make some changes to jointly and more actively build a ""community with a shared future for mankind.""It's not just Russia, Ukraine and European countries suffering as a result of the problematic security mechanism the US has shaped for the continent. In the Middle East, Africa, Latin America and the Asian-Pacific region, many countries are also suffering from tensions, conflicts and unrest directly or indirectly caused by the US, said experts.  After the outbreak of the Ukraine crisis, the US-led Western countries launched a series of unilateral sanctions, and in recent years, Washington has launched all-out containment to target China's development. These have seriously disrupted the supply and industrial chains, and the chain of capital is also being impacted, with many Western banks now paying the price, analysts said.Zhang Weiwei, dean of the China Institute at Fudan University, told the Global Times that although Russia has been isolated by the West, ""the West is isolated"" by the rest of the world. Irresponsible acts carried out by the US have backfired on its own hegemony.Wang Yiwei, director of the Institute of International Affairs at the Renmin University of China, echoed this view, saying that ""after seeing the reckless behaviors of the US and its Western followers, many countries are being very disappointed by the West that they used to admire.""In 2008, China helped the US after its financial tsunami, but Washington didn't return the favor to China and only offered more hostilities, so this time, if another financial crisis comes, the US should not ask for help from China, Zhang noted. Washington unilaterally released information about US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo planning to visit China, but without confirmation from the Chinese side. While answering a question about the US seeking to have a call between the presidents of the two countries, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said, ""Communication should not be carried out for the sake of communication. The US side should show sincerity.""Li said that in the past, China found that as long as it stabilizes ties with the US, ties with other nations will not see big problems, but since the Trump administration, China has found that the US is the biggest troublemaker and shows no sincerity in fixing ties, no matter how China expresses its kindness, so now, it's time for China to be more proactive and invest more resources in developing ties with other countries rather than prioritize ties with Washington.",CHINA,DIPLOMACY,"Soldiers from the People's Armed Police Force unit raise the Chinese national flag at People's Square in Shanghai on February 24, 2023.

The UK should be strongly condemned for this 'dirty' act: Global Times editorial,Global Times,2023-03-23,"Minister of State for Defence confirmed on March 21 that some of the ammunition for the Challenger 2 battle tanks that the UK is sending to Ukraine includes armour-piercing rounds which contain depleted uranium. This has provoked a strong reaction from Russia. President Vladimir Putin warned on the same day that the weapons will be treated by Moscow as containing ""nuclear components,"" and Russia will be forced to react. Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu said the British decision left fewer and fewer steps before a potential ""nuclear collision"" between Russia and the West. This is a matter of great significance. It needs to be pointed out that it is definitely not just a problem that Russia needs to deal with, or simply means an increased risk of escalation in the Russia-Ukraine conflict.Depleted uranium, commonly known as ""dirty bombs,"" is aptly named as the word ""dirty"" carries a profound connotation. When we hear this term, we immediately think of the US and NATO, as it is a permanent stain on their record. Although depleted uranium is not classified as a nuclear weapon, it isn't an ordinary conventional weapon either. It is because the uranium-238 it contains has chemical and radioactive substance. During the Gulf War and the Iraq War, the US military used a large amount of depleted uranium in Iraq. In 1999, NATO dropped 15 tons of depleted uranium against Yugoslavia during the bombing campaign.The impact of these depleted uranium continues to cause harm even today, with numerous examples serving as concrete evidence of its enormous harm to human health and long-term destruction to the environment. After two wars, the rates of miscarriage, congenital defects, leukemia and cancer skyrocketed in Iraq, and the incidence of cancer in Serbia also rose significantly. Even many US and NATO soldiers who participated in the war have suffered from related illnesses. From a humanitarian perspective, the use of depleted uranium is a highly immoral act.Such an immoral act, the UK is now going to do it and acts like it's a matter of course. It seems that when it comes to their own interests, international rules and morality are tools and weapons used to demand and attack others, rather than rules to constraint themselves. This trait is identical to that of the US, and even Japan, which used to readily ""apologize and bow,"" has followed the example of the US and the UK, disregarding international opposition to its unilateral decision to dump nuclear-contaminated wastewater into the Pacific Ocean.Some peace groups have been campaigning to ban depleted uranium. Last year, the United Nations General Assembly approved an Indonesian draft resolution expressing concerns about the ""health risks and environmental impact"" of depleted uranium and called for a ""cautious approach"" to their use. The vote was 147 in favor to 5 against, with the US, UK, France, Israel and Liberia opposing and 23 countries abstaining. Although an absolute minority, the US and UK, among others, have hindered a substantive ban and restrictions on the use of depleted uranium under international law, exposing flaws in the current international order.To give a simple analogy, the current Russia-Ukraine conflict is a bit like two people who have been instigated by outsiders and become so angry that they'll accept any weapon that's handed to them without considering the consequences. At such a time, whether a third party fans the flames by adding fuel or tries to mediate and persuade them to seek peace will lead to completely different results. The fact that Britain provides ""dirty bombs"" at this time is an act very malicious in nature.In fact, Ukraine, which experienced the Chernobyl nuclear power plant leakage accident, should be wary of depleted uranium. Ukraine is one of the world's most important grain and oilseed producing and exporting countries, planting including corn, wheat, barley and sunflower seed oil and so on. The potential hazards and pollution to environment caused by depleted uranium cannot be ignored. In addition, precautions should also be taken to prevent the ""broken window effect"" and ""domino effect"" caused by depleted uranium, which will lower the bottom line of the world.We call on the UN to formally discuss this issue and express clear opposition and condemnation to the UK. In response to a question from a Chinese journalist, the Deputy Spokesperson for the UN Secretary-General stated that the UN Office for Disarmament Affairs has expressed concern about any use of depleted uranium anywhere. For countries like the UK or the US, expressing ""concern"" is clearly not enough. The international community needs to increase its moral condemnation of such behavior, which is not a matter of geopolitics but of basic humanity and morality.",OPINION,EDITORIAL,Illustration: Vitaly Podvitski/Russia,Author details not found,Author details not found,34,753,<FreqDist with 14 samples and 420 outcomes>

"US' chips-spending 'guardrails' against China slammed as tech blockade, protectionism",GT staff reporters,2023-03-22,"The US' containment will not hinder China's development, but only strengthen the country's resolve and capability of reaching self-reliance of high technologies, Chinese Foreign Ministry said on Wednesday, stressing that the US will make a rod for itself if it maintains its hegemony at the cost of normal international trade.The comment came as the US Commerce Department on Tuesday (US time) unveiled ""national security guardrails"" of its CHIPS and Science Act, limiting recipients of US government funds from investing in most semiconductor manufacturing in countries including China for 10 years after the date of award.The department will restrict chipmakers that obtain the funding from expanding output by 5 percent for advanced chips and 10 percent for older technology. It outlined other measures including a $100,000 spending cap on investments in advanced capacity in China, according to a document on the US government agency's website.""The US' guardrails are outright technological blockade and protectionism,"" Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said at a regular press briefing on Wednesday.In order to maintain its own hegemony, the US has overstretched the concept of national security, abused export control measures, and even coerced some of its allies to block and contain China and attempt to fragment the industrial chains at the latter's expense, Wang said.  The US moves have seriously violated market economy rules and fair competition principle, and severely hinder world economic recovery and development, he said. ""China is firmly opposed to US' moves and has lodged solemn representations to the US. China will firmly maintain the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese firms,"" Wang said.The US' latest move came as the Biden administration has stepped up efforts to exclude China from the global semiconductor industrial chain, after it pressured the Netherlands and Japan to join its chip export controls to China and imposed sweeping export restrictions on shipments of chip-making tools to China last October.However, industry experts said that the US' CHIPS and Science Act will unlikely succeed in attracting the return of chipmakers to the US, given better supply chain coordination and lower comprehensive costs in China, as well as China's attractiveness as the world's largest semiconductor market.""By locating production in China, chipmakers not only enjoy cost and labor advantages, but are able to swiftly respond to Chinese clients' demand,"" Han Xiaomin, general manager of Jiwei Insights in Beijing, told the Global Times on Wednesday, citing media reports saying that TSMC has estimated chip production cost up 50 percent in the US than that in the island of Taiwan.While the US has always paraded itself for free competition and market economy, direct subsidies may incentivize enterprises to scramble for government funding with whatever political measures and thus harm their innovation motivation, experts said.He said the US' move will also harm the competition of others, as there are a couple of international chips from South Korea and the island of Taiwan which have facilities in the Chinese mainland, while almost no American firms have production here.TSMC has facilities for manufacturing 28-nanometer and more advanced 16-nanometer chips in Nanjing, East China's Jiangsu Province. Samsung has a factory for manufacturing memory chips in Xi'an, Northwest China's Shaanxi Province, and another South Korean chip giant, SK Hynix, manufactures memory chips in Wuxi, Jiangsu Province, according to media reports.""We will closely review the US government's announcements,"" SK Hynix told the Global Times on Wednesday. The company said that uncertainties are being cleared through discussions between the Korean and the US governments.China is one of the world's most vibrant markets for 5G, artificial intelligence (AI) and the Internet of Things, and therefore some international chipmakers have life-and-death stakes if they lose the massive Chinese market, according to Han.According to data released by the Semiconductor Industry Association, China remained the largest individual market for semiconductors in 2022, with sales in the country totaling $180.4 billion, about one-third of the global total.In a sign of the growing costs of US' tech decoupling against China, many chipmakers in the US have been cutting staff, with the latest being Marvell Technology Inc. The Silicon Valley-based maker of wireless, data processing and storage chips will cut about 320 jobs, or 4 percent of its workforce in the US, its first significant layoffs in the US over recent years, reported domestic news outlet iJiwei, which tracks the semiconductor sector.Marvell is also beginning a new round of layoffs in China, extending a job cut last from October, iJiwei reported. Marvell previously had as many as 1,000 people working in China, about 800 of whom were located in its research and development (R&D) center in Shanghai, its third-largest after its R&D centers in the US and Israel, according to media reports. Aim for breakthroughsIt has become increasingly obvious that Washington's crackdown moves on China's semiconductor industry are not as effective as it expected, as China is pooling nationwide resources for breakthroughs in core technologies, experts said.China recently announced it will establish a central commission that will be in charge of reviewing major national strategies for scientific and technological development, which is one of the most powerful changes to the country's innovation system in decades, reflecting the country's determination to achieve core technological breakthroughs.By establishing such a commission, China could combine policy-making and implementation so as to promote the development of the industry more efficiently, Ma Jihua, a veteran expert in the technology industry, told the Global Times on Wednesday, adding that it is believed certain major breakthroughs have been made.Ma pointed out that China's chip producers have already seen rapid growths over recent two years. They have greatly boosted domestic replacement and also gained more market share in the world.China's imports of integrated circuits dropped 26.5 percent year-on-year to 67.58 billion units in the first two months of 2023, while the import value fell 24.9 percent to 329 billion yuan ($47.6 billion), data from the General Administration of Customs revealed.While the US continues to push forward ""tech decoupling,"" China will continue to promote cooperation and exchanges with other countries and foreign institutions for the healthy development of the global semiconductor industry, Ma said.Experts said that the US' mounting containment on China's chip sector also goes against Washington's pragmatic needs for economic cooperation with China amid potential economic recession, high inflation and the unfolding bank crisis in the US.It's reported that US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo are considering a trip to China to talk about economic issues.""It's Washington's wishful thinking to increase economic cooperation with China while conducting sinister moves against China,"" Ma said, noting that the best choice is restoring trade and tech cooperation with China for the benefit of both countries and the world economy as a whole.",CHINA,DIPLOMACY,Quantum chips Photo: CFP,Author details not found,Author details not found,39,1065,<FreqDist with 20 samples and 652 outcomes>
"China, Russia have created a new, positive pattern of international relations between major powers and neighbors: Lukin",Bai Yunyi,2023-03-20,"Editor's Note: Chinese President Xi Jinping is scheduled to pay a three-day state visit to Russia from March 20 to 22. During his visit to Russia, President Xi will have an in-depth exchange of views with Russian President Vladimir Putin on bilateral relations and major international and regional issues of mutual interest. When Global Times reporter Bai Yunyi (GT) traveled to Moscow this week to cover Xi's visit, she interviewed Alexander Lukin (Lukin), director of the Center for East Asian and SCO Studies at the Moscow State Institute of International Relations, who shared his views on issues surrounding China-Russia relations, the Ukraine crisis, and challenges that the world is facing today.GT: What's the significance of President Xi's state visit to Russia? What message does the visit convey to the world?  Lukin: China is one of the most influential countries in the world and Russia's most reliable partner. Chinese leader's visit is, of course, very important for both Russia and the entire world. From the Russian point of view in the current situation, when relations with the US and Europe are practically frozen, Russia is deepening its cooperation with the non-Western world. China has been Russia's first trading partner since 2010. The two countries are also close strategic partners. Under the current circumstances, the significance of cooperation with China has significantly grown. As for the entire world, this visit will be very symbolic. Of course, mutual annual official visits of heads of state of Russia and China have been a tradition since the mid-1990s. There was a break during the COVID-19 pandemic years when these meetings were organized online, but now everything has come to normal. So one can argue that it is just a continuation of the pre-pandemic practice as this year, it is the turn of the Chinese leader to visit Russia. However, in the current circumstances in which many in the West have tried to press China into taking a hostile approach to Russia, the significance of this visit is self-evident. It will demonstrate that China does not yield to anybody's pressure and that the Russia-China strategic partnership is as strong as ever. By the way, Russia has been the first destination for official trips by Chinese leaders for quite some time. In March 2013, President Xi also made his first trip in the capacity of China's top leader to Russia and spoke at the Moscow State Institute of Foreign Affairs. So the fact that President Xi again chose Russia for his first foreign trip after having been elected to the highest post in China for the third time is not only a continuation of a good tradition but also a gesture of highly symbolic significance. GT: Chinese Foreign Minister Qin Gang said that China and Russia have found a path of major-country relations featuring strategic trust and good neighborliness, setting a good example for a new type of international relations. Do you think China and Russia have created a ""new pattern"" of engagement for cooperation among major powers in the world? Lukin: Yes, Russia and China have created a new, positive pattern of international relations between major powers and neighbors. They both stand for a multipolar world, but their constructive relationship shows that various poles of this world can cooperate for the benefit of the entire planet. They don't have to be engaged in geopolitical struggles for domination with other centers of power as the US does. In cooperating with each other, Russia and China work toward the democratization of the international system, trying to make it more just and inclusive. They defend the central coordinating role of the UN and fight off attempts to abolish the system according to international law based on the UN Charter. Russia and China share each other's approaches to most international issues. Naturally, they have security interests of their own, but this does not prevent Moscow and Beijing from listening to each other and forming a joint approach to various global and regional problems. 

Saint Basil's Cathedral, Moscow Photo: VCGGT: In your point of view, if there is a chance, is Russia willing to hold negotiations with Ukrainian representatives in Beijing as Saudi Arabia and Iran did?Lukin: Russia will certainly trust China.  A mediator is needed when the sides refuse to talk to each other directly. This was the situation during the Vietnam War or at some stages between Israel and the Palestinians. However, at the early stage of the conflict, Russian and Ukrainian delegations met each other directly. Now the two sides don't talk to each other, not because they are waiting for a mediator, but because Ukraine refuses to start talks before Russia is defeated. So to bring Kiev to the table, one would need not to mediate but to pressure it into agreeing to the talks. Or the situation has to change in a way that Ukrainian leaders stop thinking that defeating Russia is feasible. By providing Kiev with more and more weapons the US and its allies work in an opposite direction. GT: In recent years, the international situation has become increasingly complex and tense.  In your opinion, what are the new implications of China-Russia cooperation?Lukin: Both Russia and China are willing to defend each other's interests in such ways that do not undermine their own interests. This is understandable. Therefore, one should look for measures that are in the interests of both countries [to strengthen cooperation].  GT: By the end of March, the US may hold a so-called democracy summit, which is believed to be aimed at China and Russia. What is your view on this US move?Lukin: The so-called democracy summit is not a serious event. It is being used by the Biden administration to consolidate its domestic positions. However, even within the US, these efforts are not taken seriously by many people. I don't think we should even pay attention to it.   GT: How likely is a direct conflict between Russia and the US in 2023? In your opinion, how likely is it that this war will evolve into a world war in which more countries are directly involved?Lukin: The US is already a party to the conflict. It provides Ukraine with massive military equipment, intelligence, and all kinds of other support. But if you mean direct official involvement by American troops, I don't think it is very likely. Such a move would be highly unpopular with the US public, and the US government can hardly risk doing this before the next presidential elections. The real danger is different: The military confrontation in Ukraine can become protracted like the war in Afghanistan, or the current conflict in Yemen. Another serious danger, in my view, is the real possibility of its escalation to the level of a nuclear conflict. It may happen when one side feels that there is no other option than to use tactical nuclear weapons to stop the advancement of a stronger conventional force from the other side. This could lead to a disaster for the entire world.",IN-DEPTH,IN-DEPTH,Alexander Lukin Photo: Courtesy of Alexander Lukin,Author details not found,Author details not found,51,1151,<FreqDist with 19 samples and 597 outcomes>
"Iraq War a scandal, fraud pushed by US media as part of military-industrial complex: former CIA analyst",Global Times,2023-03-20,"Editor's Note:Monday marked the 20th anniversary since the beginning of the US-launched Iraq War. For Iraq and the Iraqi people, the wounds and pain caused by this unjust military conflict are yet to entirely heal. What was Washington's true objective behind the Iraq War? Has the war changed the US society and political landscape? Why do some US politicians tend to make warmongering remarks with regard to China? Former CIA analyst Raymond McGovern (McGovern) discussed these issues with Global Times (GT) reporter Xia Wenxin.GT: As an analyst with the CIA for 27 years, can you elaborate on the CIA's role in the war?McGovern: This is very sad for me to say, but not only the CIA operations people, but also the CIA analysts - the division in which I worked - are responsible for corrupting intelligence to justify an unnecessary war of aggression.Now, I guess the best thing I can say to you is that a Senate Intelligence Committee conducted the investigation and drew the conclusion. And here, I quote the words of Jay Rockefeller, who was the chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence. When he announced the findings, he said: ""In making the case for war, the Administration repeatedly presented intelligence as fact when in reality it was unsubstantiated, contradicted, or even non-existent. As a result, the American people were led to believe that the threat from Iraq was much greater than actually existed.""What does non-existent intelligence look like? As you probably know, there were forgeries. There were all kinds of mechanical things that were used to justify this war, especially to associate Saddam Hussein with the 9/11 attacks. They did that by claiming that Iraq had ties to Al Qaeda. Then, of course, came the weapons of mass destruction. We analysts in retirement tell people that it was a scandal and that it was a fraud, but the American people were persuaded by our media. And that's key here. In any discussion of this kind, one must emphasize the role the media plays as part of the military-industrial complex.GT: A recent Financial Times article argues that ""the Iraq war left Western societies unchanged."" Do you agree with such an assertion?McGovern: I don't usually agree with the Financial Times. But in this case, they are quite right. It was well-known that this was a fraud. It was well-known that the real objectives were not weapons of mass destruction, but permanent military bases in Iraq, oil, and Israel. But no one was held accountable, rather, some of them were promoted. And the same people are around today. Victoria Nuland, who worked for then-vice president Dick Cheney at the time, now is the No. 4 figure running the State Department. These things are very sad, but that's the reason there has been no change.GT: When the US started the Iraq War, it claimed it would create a ""friendly and democratic"" Iraq and set an example for the region. What's your take on this?McGovern: The aim was not to establish democracy in Iraq, in the Middle East, or anywhere else. That was simply the reason adduced when there were no weapons of mass destruction. When there were no ties between Saddam Hussein and Al Qaeda, they couldn't say that they went in there for the reasons that I mentioned, namely oil, Israel, and permanent military bases. So they invented this excuse, claiming that ""we are promoting democracy there.""In my view, democracy is not something you export or that you fix on a country by virtue of attacking it or removing its leaders. That's not the way democracy is supposed to work. That was ludicrous on its face. It was simply justification that ""We were promoting democracy. Saddam Hussein was not democratic. And so we did what we had to do to remove him.""The only positive effect seen in that part of the world, was the fact that Saddam Hussein was no longer any threat to Israel. Iraq, indeed, was on its back militarily. And the Israelis rejoiced, and those who were responsible and those who were under Israeli influence in our country also rejoiced.GT: Several US officials have intensified their clamor for war against China, with some even saying that the two countries will be at war by 2025. What is the cause of this?McGovern: I don't know why the US is doing this. I guess one reason is what they call the military-industrial complex. I already mentioned that the media is an essential fulcrum in this military-industrial complex. And you make a lot of money waging war, or even just building up to wage war. Now, what lies at the bottom of all this is that you need enemies to spend more money on armaments than you do on programs of social uplift. That's precisely what America is doing. And very powerful people who have great influence in Congress, which controls the purse strings, are profiteering on arms build-up and war.I think any objective observer would ask: ""America, do you really contemplate getting into a two-front war with the two other big superpowers? Is that what you want to provoke?"" And the answers from Anthony Blinken and Jake Sullivan would be that we're very exceptional; we're the best and the brightest.Now, some of your audiences will realize that The Best and The Brightest was the name of a wonderful book written about the people that got us into Vietnam and got 3 million Vietnamese civilians and fighters, along with 58,000 US soldiers, killed. So the best and the brightest are not really bright if they come from this exceptional attitude that believes they can do whatever they want and they will prevail. Because this time, with respect to Ukraine, they're not prevailing, and that will become clearer as the weeks go by now with Russia on the march west.GT: Regarding the Taiwan question, how do you view Washington's enhanced provocation against the Chinese mainland? McGovern: The US officially agrees that there is only one China, and [the island of] Taiwan is a province of China. Now, what are we doing? Giving people on the island of Taiwan a false sense of security that they can do whatever they want and allow their island to be a major arms depot, a warehouse full of very sophisticated weaponry? But to use against whom?Well, is the Chinese mainland threatening to launch a military attack on [the island of] Taiwan? I have not seen any evidence of that. I think China is very patient. But why is the US meddling? The only somewhat reasonable explanation I could get is the military-industrial complex. As long as China has a very potent navy, which it now has, we have to build up our navy. And who profiteers from that? The same defense outfits collapsed a decade ago, when Obama said that ""we're pivoting to Asia, and defending against China is a major test.""

"GT Voice: Beware, global investors! Don’t let US banks devour your cash",Global Times,2023-03-12,"While Wall Street analysts said the failure of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) won't lead to any systemic risk to the broader financial system, it should be noted that US regulators' measures to tackle with the SVB fall and handling of its customers' deposits will offer an important window to see whether the crisis has the potential to magnify.The collapse of SVB is causing shockwaves to start-ups around the world, as tech companies have warned that the potential fallout could deal a fatal blow to tech start-ups and the entire sector if respective governments do not intervene.In the UK, more than 200 UK-based tech company executives urged Downing Street to step in, warning that many companies faced an ""existential threat"" because they banked with the UK arm of SVB, the Financial Times reported on Sunday.SVB also has branches in Canada, Denmark, Germany, India, Israel, Sweden and China. At present, SVB customers, which are not covered by the insurance scheme of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), are waiting anxiously to find out if they can recover their deposits, including many Chinese tech start-ups. Some US-listed Chinese companies may have banked their IPO proceeds at SVB, and many Chinese high-tech companies that received US dollar-denominated investments may deposit the funds in SVB before the money is settled and transferred to their domestic bank accounts, according to Chinese media reports.It is important to note that during the handling of the SVB failure, the interests of tech start-ups and investors, whether from China or the UK, or from any other country around the world, need to be guaranteed, even if they may not be covered by the US government-backed insurance scheme. If the interests of any start-up company end up being sacrificed in the crisis' black hole, it will have catastrophic consequences for both market confidence and liquidity. Therefore, it is time for US regulators to take the responsibility to ensure that depositors can get their money back so as to prevent bank customer panic from spreading.This is because the fall of SVB, the largest bank failure since the 2008 financial crisis, may be just the tip of the iceberg of a systemic liquidity crisis. It fell down because of a bank run as investors were eager to transfer their deposits after learning SVB had suffered heavy losses due to the aggressive rate hikes by the Federal Reserve. More or less, the problems with SVB also exist at other American banks, and needless to say, the SVB collapse in just 48 hours will cause customers to have concerns about their own deposits at other small and medium-sized banks. That is to say, if US regulators fail to properly handle the SVB fallout to curb the ripple effect, market panic will spread and more bank runs will take place. Therefore, the severity of the consequences of the SVB collapse actually hinges on whether US regulators can handle the crisis properly.Many have likened the SVB collapse to the Lehman Brothers crisis of 2008. However, Lehman Brothers collapsed due to a debt crisis, while SVB imploded due to a liquidity crunch. The fact that SVB's failure came just days after it was listed in Forbes magazine's annual ranking of the best banks in America is actually a more worrying sign about the US economy. The Fed's struggle to balance its conflicting goals of taming in inflation and maintaining growth, with the US economy teetering on the brink of a hard landing and the possibility of fighting a high inflation in the long run, has further dented investor confidence and more easily led to liquidity crunch. The US financial system is suffering economic repercussions for its irresponsible monetary policy.In this sense, it now seems necessary to advise Chinese companies and investors to watch out for potential risks when it comes to putting money into US financial institutions and assets. Chinese investors need to take appropriate measures and precautions such as insurance to reduce their exposure to the growing risks in US financial markets in case of such a black swan event as Blackstone and SVB.",SOURCE,GT VOICE,"A customer stands outside of a shuttered Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) headquarters on March 10, 2023 in Santa Clara, California.

Saudi-Iran agreement a win-win-win-win deal that breaks the Carter Doctrine,Ebrahim Hashem,2023-03-12,"The recent Saudi-Iran agreement has come as a major surprise to most observers, but making the announcement and revealing its details from Beijing has been a bigger surprise.The China-facilitated rapprochement between Saudi Arabia and Iran has given the world another proof that unipolarity no longer exists and that we are already in a de facto multipolar world order.The Middle East and the world are not only in a post-America order, but also in a post-West order. The fast-changing regional and global political landscape is increasingly looking different from what the world has experienced over the last two centuries.  Individual regional nations are steadily regaining agency and rapidly building capacity to protect their sovereignty and act according to their national interests.Saudi Arabia has sent a clear signal to the world that it is seriously diversifying its strategic partnerships and that it is building relations with the world based on its national and regional objectives. Iran has demonstrated that it cannot be isolated and that it can show flexibility and readiness to establish common understanding with its neighbors to address regional challenges.The willingness of Saudi Arabia and Iran to go to the Chinese capital and announce their reconciliation from there is a message not only to the region, but also to the world that no one single country or bloc of countries has dominance over the Middle East and global affairs. Moreover, it illustrates that China, a meteorically re-emerging power, has a lot to contribute to global peace and stability.  China’s contribution to global stability is becoming more evident not only through China’s proposals such as Global Security Initiative (GSI), which it has further explained recently, but also in its actual efforts on the ground as demonstrated by the current case of Saudi-Iran agreement. Announcing the agreement from Beijing has officially and openly broken the 1980 Carter Doctrine that considered the Gulf region the US’ exclusive sphere of influence.  This doctrine has ended organically; it is a natural consequence of the fast-changing regional and world order. It is also the result of the regional players’ eagerness to bring in global powers that have enough political capital and leverage with all sides to function as effective guarantors of regional stability.China’s strategy in the region is not confrontational, but pragmatic and realistic. The Chinese are not demanding that the region be their exclusive sphere of influence; they are not forcing the Chinese development model and ideology upon the regional people.  China has defined its economic, trade and diplomatic strategic goals and is now calmly pursuing them with the consensus of the regional nations. This is one major reason the regional leaders are comfortable dealing with the Chinese leaders, allowing China a larger role in the region, especially now that the economic, political and security architecture of the region and the world is being reshaped.Saudi-Iran agreement was sealed after serious steps taken by regional nations to proactively handle their challenges with minimum involvement from non-regional powers.  This is why the initial five rounds of the Saudi-Iran negotiations took place in neutral regional countries, namely Iraq and Oman. The preliminary discussions prepared the ground for the final round, which was the most contentious, requiring a global sponsor of China’s stature and credibility with various regional countries.This is a win-win-win-win agreement. It is a win for Saudi Arabia because it has 2030 Vision, which is aimed at transforming its economy and making it among the top 10 in the world. The Saudis have introduced many regional initiatives such as Saudi Green Initiative, which cannot be implemented effectively without regional stability and cooperation. It is a win for Iran because it will gain the advantage of normalizing relations with the Arabs and ending its regional and global isolation. This will in turn boost its economy and trade at a time when the US and Israel have been openly threatening to use military force against it. Furthermore, this agreement has put an end to the idea of “the Middle East NATO,” which has been introduced and promoted by the US and Israel, to bring the Arabs into a hostile anti-Iran bloc – and perhaps jointly militarily attack Iran. The Iranians now know that the Arabs will not join any future military bloc against it.  Furthermore, China, as the guarantor of the Saudi-Iran agreement, will have the moral responsibility and obligation to work against any such eventuality. It is a win for the region because it will accelerate the process of deescalating and finally resolving regional issues in places such as Yemen, Syria, Iraq, and Lebanon. This will in turn allow the region to have the right atmosphere for economic integration and development. It will help build trust between key regional players and enable them to have high-level alignment in their visions for the region, helping them boost regional growth. This agreement will pave the way for the people in the entire region to unlock their potential and achieve prosperity, which they have been eagerly seeking, especially after more than 20 years of conflicts. From the announced agreement terms, it is apparent that the Saudi and Iranian decision-makers are convinced that for their region to be thriving and prospering, they first need to eliminate the longstanding issues across the region. The agreement is a win for China because it will eventually bring stability in a region, from which it imports a considerable percentage of its energy. Saudi Arabia is the largest oil exporter to China; five out of six Gulf Arab countries are regularly among China’s top oil and gas suppliers. China is the largest oil importer from the Gulf region and the largest trading partner of all regional players, including Saudi Arabia and Iran.  China signed a 25-year agreement with the promise of investing $400 billion in Iran in 2021.Also, the region has a young population with a growing market potential for Chinese exports. This is becoming more important now because the Western markets are becoming hostile to Chinese businesses and products. Therefore, China will be able to diversify its markets away from the increasingly unreliable and politically susceptible Western markets, especially now that the US-China great power rivalry is intensifying globally.The Gulf region’s security is an important matter to China not only because it is one of the largest oil and gas exporting regions, but also because it is geographically strategically located in the heart of global trade, overlooking important maritime waterways such as Hormuz and Bab Al-Mandab straits.  It is a region where significant sections of China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) are implemented.This agreement, if followed through effectively and satisfactorily, is going to end the era of strategic conspiracy against the region and start a new era of strategic prosperity for the region. Saudi-Iran agreement is a breakthrough for regional stability and Chinese diplomacy with implications that go far beyond regional borders. The author is former adviser to the chairman of the Abu Dhabi Executive Office, an authority responsible for Abu Dhabi's long-term strategies, and former head of the strategy division of Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC).

"China puts itself at the forefront of a proactive foreign policy to be a peace builder, stability provider: Palestinian Ambassador to China",Global Times,2023-03-12,"Editor's Note:The two sessions, one of China's most important annual political events, are an important window for the outside world to understand China's development achievements, plans, governance philosophy, diplomatic concepts and global initiatives. Through this window, international observers closely watch China's moves and recognize China's development. ""For China, peace and stability are very important in its foreign policy; that is why China is devoted to put its sincere efforts to achieve them throughout the whole world and express its readiness to work with all other relevant actors at the international level,"" Palestinian Ambassador to China Fariz Mehdawi (Mehdawi), told Global Times (GT) reporter Wang Wenwen in an interview. He said that the Palestinian people are quite happy about ""the proactive foreign policy of China putting itself at the forefront to be a peace builder and stability provider.""This is the seventh interview of this series over the two sessions.GT: Why does China stress so much on the people? How do the two sessions practice the people-centered development philosophy?Mehdawi: China is ruled by a unique political system, and it is based on the satisfaction of the population at large. The legitimacy of the system comes from the overall satisfaction, endorsement, and approval of the people. During the last few decades, any fair observer would say the vast majority of the Chinese people are happy about what's happening in their country, and they're optimistic about the future. That's really a sign of approval that gives the legitimacy of the system itself and the institutions they are governing.This is not the case in different countries such as those with a liberal democracy. That's why the emphasis of leadership here is what could please the population at large, and what the people are expecting. The Party is enshrined within the people because it's a huge party, which knows what's happening throughout the system. The Party comes from within the population. They would adjust exactly according to the needs of the people. Many people who are not Chinese don't know how the system works. Actually, there is so much monitoring and evaluation which is happening continuously throughout the population in cities, towns, villages, and the countryside.After living here in this country for six years, I've been following what's going on in the countryside, when I travel around China. They would say we are not happy about this; we are happy about that. It's very dynamic, a kind of interactive democracy, which reaches from down to the top level of leadership. So, every year, whenever the two sessions are held, those policies would take into consideration the feedback which is coming from the masses. This is quite an experience which doesn't look like in any other place.  GT: In your opinion, what is ""people-centered?"" Mehdawi: China has gone a long way in alleviating the living standards of the Chinese people up to 1.4 billion or even more. There is no such other country like China. The last batch of those who were really living under the poverty line as has been defined by the United Nations has just been brought down to zero. So, there is no more extreme poverty in China; this is by itself a huge achievement. Many countries have not been able to achieve this.But it doesn't mean that the distribution of growth in China was also equal at the same time. So, this is the problem that the government and the Party are intended really to fix - bridging between those who have and those who have not. Because we talk about socialism here. Socialist country should guarantee, I'm not saying equality or obsolete equality, but at least the gap should be reasonable.There was a need for adjustment. This adjustment is going to be reflected in the economic policies of the country, for example, changing from an export-oriented economy into what we call a dual-circulation policy in which the consumption here is going to be the real generator for the development and for the growth.These policies are going to be strengthened. It has started already, but I think the line of the new policy is going to adjust to guarantee that every Chinese will have a better level of life and better quality of life, because we are talking here about common prosperity.So far, I think the government has taken good steps, but more is needed. So mainly what I'm saying is that it will be a mix of continuity as it used to be and new adjustments to increase the level of income of the ordinary. Make sure that nobody is unemployed and also respond to the priorities of the national security of the country in terms of food, for example, sufficiency, and certain needs in the high tech. China is all the time a stable political system that is capable to renew itself from within without endangering the stability of the society, which remains very important for the achievement of sustainable development.

 GT: How do you evaluate China's role as a peacemaker, like in the Palestinian question and the Ukraine issue? Mehdawi: The Israeli practices against our population at large are really unprecedented in the terms of their cruelty and aggression, which keep no hope for a peaceful solution. It's very depressing. It shows that the peace process for Palestine seems to be a very tough challenge for us to reach, the Chinese position about the two-state solution, which the whole world is endorsing, is quite genuine.For China, peace and stability are very important in its foreign policy; that is why China is devoted to putting its sincere efforts to achieve them throughout the whole world and expressing its readiness to work with all other relevant actors at the international level. So, this dynamic foreign policy of China is very important. Now we have seen recently, China has proposed a position paper on the situation in Ukraine, which is very important. No wonder it has received a good positive response and endorsement by many countries around the world. I hope that China can really make a constructive move in that direction. That depends on the positive response from other players, such as the European Union and by both Russia and Ukraine. China has got balanced relations with both countries and they are well-situated to play its role.So, we are quite happy about the proactive foreign policy of China putting itself at the forefront to be a peace builder and stability provider. GT: How do the Global Development Initiative and Global Security Initiative advocated by China reflect the country's diplomatic outlook?Mehdawi: It is actually a response to the international crisis that we are passing through. We have seen over the last five years how much the whole world politics is in trouble. Although we have got the United Nations system, most of the resolutions and principles have been ignored by some other players. Unfortunately, the global governing system is not working by the book. We need to realize that we are living in a multipolar system in which no country can really dictate the rules. So, the rules in what we call a world of rules-based order are the ones which had been accepted by the world, not those rules which had been put by some powerful countries to enforce them selectively whenever and wherever it is suitable or favorable to their interests. This is the basic principle of democracy and equality. We need to guarantee that there is a fair and equal globalized governing system, not because it's nice, but because it's necessary.I think China is advocating that we really need to adjust the global system to ensure that it's multipolar, it's not unipolar. Those countries, which are responsible because they are big and powerful in their economy and their technology, should take care of those who do not have. We're talking about equality within one society, but there is also a lack of equality among the global citizens of the world. There are people who are on the disadvantaged receiving end in Asia, the Middle East, Africa and Latin American countries, where they have got really serious challenges even with affording basic needs in housing, water and education. It is a responsibility for all of us to ensure that humans at large are living in dignity with reasonable equality. We need to fill the gap between those who have and those who have not at the international level, not only at the national level.I think we need to thank China for initiating those kinds of proposals, which are actually put forward for discussion and debate ideas. GT: From the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) to a human community with a shared future, why have these initiatives initiated by China received widespread response from the international community, especially developing countries? Mehdawi: China is trying to replicate its own experience. If we see how development has happened in China across the last 30 to 40 years, it was by really increasing connectivity. If we check how many thousands of kilometers of roads and railways had been built inside China to connect its west with its east, how many bridges, airports, the connectivity in terms of infrastructure and building of energy had developed China and it was a very successful experience.When we talk about BRI, this is the same policy that China applied inside its own borders by expanding it into a larger scale, into the neighborhood and to the world, which is bringing a new dynamic to the world economy.In the beginning, this was a simple thought. But some forces like to see it as a conspiracy for domination or a strategic plan of hegemony. It's not. China discovered that by building projects of infrastructure that connects countries, it turns itself into a partner with those countries instead of being enemies who are only giving back to each other. We are neighbors, and we need to connect with each other. This is a very good recipe for stability, cooperation and peace.So, it's good for China to share projects, roads and railways, economic cooperation and trade which make neighbors partners and friends work together for mutual benefits. It provides peace among good neighbors and enables them to work with each other far away from hostility and suspicion into partnership and cooperation. You can see the BRI had already helped not only China, but also its neighbors. Central Asia now is connecting East Asia with Europe, becoming not a center of conflict between Europe and Asia, but rather a bridge for cooperation. In this case, both sides are winning. Nobody is losing with this kind of cooperation. This is very courageous on the part of China to propose and initiate such a major and mega plan. This is the only available plan actually in town - we can't see other initiatives that could generate growth to the whole world economy. I think this is something to be appreciated, and I'm sure many countries have already appreciated and joined the BRI. Recently, the State of Palestine signed the agreement and formally became a member in this initiative. Hopefully, we are going to be a beneficiary. It's not about China. It's a global initiative.",OPINION,VIEWPOINT,Photo: VCG,Author details not found,Author details not found,88,1840,<FreqDist with 20 samples and 881 outcomes>

US' shameful politics will continue as parasitic oligarchy prevails,Dakotah Lilly,2023-03-09,"NPR recently did a segment dedicated to the question of whether or not the US politics has entered into a state of ""post-shame politics"". They discussed the examples of Representative George Santos, as well as Presidents Bill Clinton and Donald Trump.In the case of Santos they cited the numerous proven lies that Santos has fabricated; including lies about his education, job history, property ownership, ancestry, and much more including crimes he has committed. In the case of Bill Clinton, the NPR commentators spoke about the allegations of womanizing and draft dodging as well as perjury and his affair with Monica Lewinsky. The example of Trump revolved around the Access Hollywood tape that features Trump speaking lewdly about sexual assault and female anatomy. There are several aspects to Santos' story that make it particularly offensive and egregious to a sizable portion of the American public. This speaks to just how low the bar has fallen in terms of the standards that ""leaders"" are held to. How is it that somebody who not only won their party's nomination but also their general election, felt comfortable enough that they could lie about almost everything under the sun?Santos has so far refused to resign and has hinted that he actually plans to weather the storm and run for re-election, despite repeated calls from both parties for his resignation. From his family, to his education and work history, crimes he claims to have been a victim of, bogus residency claims, and so much more; there is very little that Santos has been truthful about. Yet, Santos is one of 435 voting members of the House of Representatives and he felt he would be protected and comfortable enough to spread and repeat these easily verifiable facts. This just goes to show how little shame the political class has and how little respect the elites have for the people of this country.I think to a certain extent it is clear; we are indeed living through a political stage that is without shame, but the question remains. Has US politics ever not been shrouded in shame? Countless instances of political corruption, sex scandals, conflicts of interest, and crimes can be cited as evidence that the US political class truly has no shame. Conduct that would certainly and rightfully lead to an average person getting fired at work and in their career has become commonplace for the US ruling class and its politicians.Even more recently we have seen political shame taken to new heights; heights that gravely insult the intelligence and the sensibilities of the people of the US. Corporate greed, privatization, and deregulation have all contributed in no small parts to the recent train derailments in Ohio.These trains were for whatever reason carrying carcinogenic and poisonous chemicals. While the infrastructure across the US continues to crumble beneath our feet, the company responsible for these derailments; Norfolk Southern, has spent billions of dollars on stock buybacks. This same company has pledged a 2.5 million dollar ""community support fund"" which I am sure will entitle them to more tax breaks. 2.5 million for the crimes that occurred in Ohio, and 10 billion dollars for a stock buyback program… this is what passes for justice in the US; shame! While other nations, especially including China, can boast of high speed rail that is safe, affordable, and convenient, people in the US will have to settle for derailments and poisoned food, air, and water.While toxic clouds of poison engulf communities and destroy the air that we breathe, the food that we eat, and the water that we drink, US politicians are nowhere to be found. Oh wait! We all actually knew exactly where President Biden was while people in East Palestine are being subjected to poisoned water, air, and food; he was in Kiev, Ukraine! To Biden, and the rest of the political and economic elites, the citizens of East Palestine simply are not on their radar; they are simply forgotten workers/plebeians. To add insult to injury, the Biden administration has been wholly absent in any meaningful response to the tragedy in Ohio, meanwhile billions and billions of liquidity and weapons alike is being pumped into Ukraine for their proxy war against Russia. Trump of course went to Ohio for a fabulous display of political PR, but he also holds no answers for the working people of the US… but at least he showed up.To answer the NPR journalists question; yes, we are living through a post-shame era of politics in the US. This shameful system will continue for as long as the people remain subjects of the parasitic oligarchy that has infected the US political, economic, and media systems. The people of this country have great shame for their government, yet we remain powerless to stop it.The author is a political and economic analyst with a concentration in areas such as socialism of the 21st century, Chavismo, Populism, Latin America, Geopolitical Trends, Latin America, and Kirchnerismo. opinion@globaltimes.com.cn",OPINION,VIEWPOINT,"The US Capitol building is seen in Washington, DC., on November 4, 2022.

"Why would the White House bother to care about Ohio? It’s not Ukraine, Russia or China",Xin Ping,2023-03-08," When the Ohio train derailment accident came into public view, it had been more than a week since it happened. While toxic chemicals were spreading over East Palestine, American government officials ignored it, and major US media outlets were weirdly slow to cover the story. ""Breaking news: Ohio government has filed a constitutional amendment to legally change the Ohio state flag to the Ukraine flag so they can get funding from the Biden administration."" People mocked when they found out that President Biden made a surprise visit to Kiev rather than Ohio on American President's Day. ""That was the biggest slap in the face,"" East Palestine Mayor Trent Conaway said. ""He can send every agency he wants to, but I found out this morning that he was in Ukraine giving millions of dollars away to people over there and not to us.""US Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg had been silent long after the disaster. When he showed up a week later, the disaster was still out of his sight. ""It couldn't be a more exciting time for transportation,"" Buttigieg said when he introduced Biden's $1.2 trillion infrastructure bill. ""It's had its challenges ... Partly because of the pandemic ... Now we got balloons."" He still remembered to make a cranky joke about balloons but didn't mention a single word about one of the worst environmental emergencies in decades. Silverado Caggiano, a hazardous materials specialist, said, ""We basically nuked a town with chemicals so we could get a railroad open.""In contrast to the collective indifference to the train derailment, the so-called ""spy balloon"" dominated US media headlines. So how come US media can spot a balloon 40,000 feet high but turn a blind eye to the derailment of 50 train cars? Do they really believe that the ""potential threat"" of a balloon weighs much more than the release of 1 million pounds of vinyl chloride? There is no doubt that politicians love to say to the public anything about China's balloons or Russia's threat, but nothing about their failures in overseeing domestic transportation, which has led to poor management. Between 1990 and 2021, there were on average 1,705 train derailments per year in the US, according to data from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics and the Federal Railroad Administration. In 2021 alone, there were 1,627 train accidents, resulting in 8 deaths and 118 injuries.Under constant lobbying from the industry and stakeholders, the executive and legislative branches of the US have continuously lowered industry standards and relaxed safety regulations on the transportation of dangerous chemicals. The Obama administration issued safety rules in 2015 that significantly loosened regulatory standards for what types of dangerous chemicals could be used and how they could be transported.A similar derailment in New Jersey in November 2012 that released 23,000 gallons of vinyl chloride prompted actions to further regulate how the rail industry handled shipments of toxic materials. The push eventually led to a law requiring trains carrying toxic substances to be equipped with electronic braking systems. But the Trump administration rescinded the rule, on account of pressure from lobbyists who argued that the change would be costly for railway companies.Such attention-diverting tricks will sooner or later be exposed. Hyping the ""Russia challenge"" or ""China threat"" is never a panacea for the US' problems. It's a cry-wolf game that eventually destroys trust and leaves the shepherd helpless. The author is a commentator on international affairs, writing regularly for the Global Times, China Daily, etc. He can be reached at xinping604@gmail.com",OPINION,VIEWPOINT,Is US hyping China threat to cover up Ohio accident?

Second train derailment in Ohio in about a month tests crisis of confidence for current US administration,Global Times,2023-03-06," Another train derailed in Ohio on Saturday, which is the second such incident in the same state in about a month, further highlighting a serious crisis of confidence for the current US administration.The train derailment of about 20 cars of a 212-car train happened near Springfield and hazardous materials were not found and no causalities were reported, Reuters reported citing rail operator Norfolk Southern. No causes for the derailment have been released.  Local officials had ordered residents living near the site to shelter in place.The accident recalled how the US poorly handled the latest disaster on February 3, when 50 cars, including 10 carrying hazardous materials, derailed in a fiery crash in East Palestine. The incident caused the leakage of a large amount of toxic chemicals. But US officials and mainstream media underplayed the incident and turned a blind eye to the threat it may cause to people.Chinese experts had warned that the chemical leak accident, ""underestimated by the US,"" poses a serious safety hazard for Americans living in the affected area, with lingering effects of at least 20 years. They also believe US authorities' ""controlled burn"" of the toxic gas could release more lethal substance into the environment, which they said fully exposed US government's irresponsible attitude toward people's health.The Ohio derailment will create a serious crisis of confidence in the current US administration, as Americans increasingly realize that the authorities cannot solve their problems.Rail accidents are common in the US where an average of about 1,700 train derailments occur each year, often due to technical reasons. The railroad industry is woefully unregulated, and railroads always put profits ahead of safety, according to a Guardian report.",WORLD,AMERICAS,"A Donald Trump supporter wears a hazmat suit and respirator as he crosses the railroad tracks prior to Trump's arrival to speak in the village of East Palestine, Ohio on February 22, 2023.

Active role of China in serious global issues is very visible,Global Times,2023-03-02,"Editor's Note: The two sessions, one of China's most important annual political events, is an important window for the outside world to understand China's development achievements, plans, governance philosophy, diplomatic concepts and global initiatives. Through this window, international observers closely watch China's moves and recognize China's development and achievements. The creative and active role of China in addressing the current crisis around the world is important, and China can go further, Danilo Türk (Türk), former president of Slovenia, told the Global Times (GT) reporter Lu Yuanzhi. This is the first interview of this series.GT: In 2023, the challenges facing the world will increase. The global economy is struggling to recover in the post-pandemic era, and it has become a consensus that China's development will be an opportunity for the world. China is entering the two sessions time in March. What are your expectations for the upcoming two sessions?Türk: There are two types of expectations. The first is related to the short-term, and immediate tasks. Obviously, this is the early post-pandemic situation, and it could be very important to see how China plans its recovery from the COVID situation. Now, we have already seen a fairly positive assessment from the International Monetary Fund, which projects China's economy will grow by 5.2 percent this year. This is much higher than any other part of the world. That is very good. But it will be important to see what measures the Chinese government will take to stimulate growth and to shape development in ways which will also enhance international cooperation with China. The second aspect is more of a long-term nature. Because two sessions this year comes after the 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, which was held late last year, obviously, there were some important strategic directions defined at the congress. The one I think is particularly interesting is the concept of common prosperity for all. This is particularly important because China has had such an explosive growth in the past 20 or 30 years, which created large differences of wealth and income. Some people did very well and have become very rich, but some people are left behind, and there are many issues of social development that have to be addressed out.It is also necessary to see what kind of strategy will be put in place to deal with intergenerational issues, because the society is aging. In Europe, aging population brings new questions, such as higher costs of healthcare, questions relating to retirement age, and the post-retirement life of people who have completed their most active part of their lives. And there are many other issues, just specific to China, which has had very dynamic urbanization. There are many things which come under the framework of common prosperity for all. And it would be interesting for the world to see how China approaches these issues, as that will have an impact on economy. It will also be important for the world as a whole, which is also dealing with the same kind of issues.All these are the kind of things which will be looking at during the two sessions and the immediate aftermath. And generally, I think one should be hopeful that China's development in the next days will help.GT: At the Boao Forum in April 2022 which you also attended, President Xi Jinping launched his Global Security Initiative. What do you think the China-proposed Global Security Initiative will contribute to the resolution of world security issues?   Türk: In general, this initiative is very welcome and very timely, and I think that creative and active role of China is highly appreciated. Now the question is how to go further. The new Chinese Foreign Minister Qin Gang just had an interesting statement over the initiative on February 21. I believe further policy statements will flash out, giving more details to the initiative. This is a very sound conceptual basis for the work. We will see what comes as the follow-up in this conceptual level.Then at the same time, the question of the role of China in addressing the current crisis around the world is going to be important as well. The world has seen that China has taken an active approach in the Middle East. We have seen various communications between China and Iran, Saudi Arabia, Israel as well as other actors. We see that China is positioning itself as an important actor in the Middle East. On February 24, China's position paper on political settlement of Ukraine crisis was released, which is a very welcome development. These issues are very serious and very difficult to resolve, but the active role of China is very visible. And obviously, China has been active on that issue from the beginning. For example, in March 2022, China has issued a very interesting statement on Ukraine, in which, among other things, China emphasized the need to rebuild the European security architecture and make it sustainable. Sustainability of security architecture is something that has to be constructed over time. It will be important to watch the further developments. GT: This year marks the 10th anniversary of the BRI. What's your take on the BRI's achievements so far? What is your expectation for the role of the BRI in the post-pandemic era?Türk: BRI has already changed the world considerably. In the immediate vicinity of China - that is Southeast Asia, or the Pacific, or Central Asia, where China obviously is historically a major player, China has upgraded its role with the BRI projects.In more distant regions from the perspective of China, such as Latin America, China has become a major, possibly the largest economic partner of many countries in Latin America. And also in Africa, China has concluded BRI agreements with 52 African countries. That means practically all African countries are partners with China. The BRI has already changed much. It is a development initiative, which is characterized by problems of development and cooperation. And China has to take a look at the experience of others. For example, there are some parts of the world where other big players like the European Union or Japan have been active for a long time and has accumulated an important body of experience. In the future, China has to incorporate or absorb the entire development experience and see how best to develop the BRI further. For instance, how to use the digital technologies for the purpose of improving development and taking into account everything that has been happening in the domain of development in the past.I would like to see a model of triangular relationships, although it is not very realistic at this moment. In Africa, for example, it would be interesting to see if African Union could propose to China, European Union, their main partners in development, a kind of more trilateral project.Africa has always cooperated with Europe, and it is now cooperating with China. Each of them brings a different development perspective, it remains to be seen whether the African Union would propose the three sides work together. Conceptually, it is easy to imagine, but it is difficult to do. I would like to see more of that in the future. When talking about the 10th anniversary of the BRI, we have to be encouraged by what has happened so far. But at the same time, we need to explore the whole potential of the BRI. The potential is still very large, much larger than it is exploited at present. I would urge for more ambitious, more imaginative forms of cooperation, which would include other partners as well, not only China, not only the countries concerned, but also other partners.GT: China pursues the diplomatic philosophy of multilateralism and win-win cooperation. In contrast, the US is keen on roping in its allies to create small circles to engage in confrontation. How do you see the comparison between these two countries?Türk: Responsibility is the key word in this context. Now we have some global institutions, such as the United Nations (UN), but it cannot do everything, which has been clear from start. There are some regional and trans-regional organizations as well. We have a variety of organizational forms. The question here is, how they could work together, working in a synchronized way.There is nothing wrong if small groups of countries get together to do projects that serve their particular interests. But the Charter of the UN is very clear on the point that enforcement action can be only authorized by the UN Security Council. It cannot be done independently by regional organizations or other small groups of states, except for self-defense.But coming to the general question that you raised, I would say it is important to develop certain principles of cooperation, which will reconcile these two approaches. The key is to follow principles, which I would like to recite very precisely - No state and no group of states should build their security at the expense of other states' security. It's all fine and good if a small group of countries like member states of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) develop their own security cooperation, in a bid to strengthen their collective security. But it would be wrong if the SCO were to develop a kind of hostile attitude towards countries which are not members of that grouping. It applies to all regional organizations, including the EU, as well as trans-regional organizations such as NATO. I believe that we need to have very serious and responsible political discussion about the principle. GT: In your opinion, will US succeed in its attempt to contain and isolate China? Will China's friend circle get increasingly big? Why?Türk: A short answer is no. China cannot be isolated. China is too strongly connected with the whole world to be isolated. That is simply impossible, even if it was attempted. That is also not in the interest of the US to isolate China. That would be unreasonable. I think that one has to understand after the ending of the Cold War, the collapse of Soviet Union and the Soviet system created a vacuum in which the dominant role of the US became inevitable that couldn't happen otherwise. That was 30 years ago. And the subsequent decades have changed, including the rise of China. China today is a much more important international player in every respect and Russia has also been resurgent. In the future, it would be wiser to use some of the wisdom of the era of Richard Nixon, the US president who was probably the most experienced one on foreign policy across US history. He helped developing a kind of a triangular relationship, which included the US, China and the Soviet Union. It is not happening yet, but we could think about a kind of a triangular relations in the future, but perhaps even larger, say a rectangular or quadrangular relationship, which would include the EU in a more creative and independent role in this kind of global management. I think that the future is uncertain, but we have models from the past which are teaching us that stepping out from the unipolar world toward a more multipolar arrangement is possible. And the UN framework is sufficiently comfortable for all that to take place. It's possible and doable. I hope there will be enough wisdom available to make it happen.",OPINION,COLUMNISTS,"A bustling scene in Shenzhen, Guangdong Province on January 15, 2023.Photo: VCG",Author details not found,Author details not found,100,1858,<FreqDist with 18 samples and 929 outcomes>

 The first Saudi ambassador to Palestine Naif bin Bandar Al-Sudairi arrived in the West Bank on Tuesday, the official Palestinian news agency WAFA reported.Leading an official delegation, Al-Sudairi, the non-resident ambassador to Palestine and non-resident consul general in Jerusalem, presented his credentials to Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas at the presidency headquarters in Ramallah, it said.Al-Sudairi's arrival comes amid Israel's efforts to normalize relations with Saudi Arabia.During their meeting, Abbas welcomed Al-Sudairi and said his visit to Palestine and his appointment as Saudi ambassador to the State of Palestine would contribute to ""strengthening the strong fraternal relations that bind the two countries and the two brotherly peoples.""The Saudi ambassador said he hoped that his visit would be ""a successful beginning for strengthening relations in all fields,"" stressing his country's firm and supportive positions for the Palestinian people and their just cause.Earlier in the day, Al-Sudairi told reporters in a statement that ""the Arab Peace Initiative is the basic point in any upcoming agreement,"" after being asked about the fate of the initiative in the event of reaching a normalization deal between Saudi Arabia and Israel.The Arab Peace Initiative was launched in 2002 after it was drafted by Saudi Arabia and adopted by the Arab League.The initiative calls for an end to the conflict between Israel and Palestine and the normalization of relations between Israel and Arab states, in exchange for an Israeli withdrawal from the areas it gained since 1967 and proper settlement to the issue of Palestinian refugees.The Palestinians demanded the establishment of an independent state alongside Israel in all of the Palestinian territories occupied by Israel in 1967, including the entire West Bank and the Gaza Strip, with East Jerusalem as its capital.The Saudi ambassador also confirmed that his country intends to open a consulate in East Jerusalem soon.",PHOTO,WORLD,"Saudi ambassador to Palestine Naif bin Bandar Al-Sudairi (Front) arrives at the Palestinian foreign ministry headquarters in the West Bank city of Ramallah, on Sept. 26, 2023.(Photo: Xinhua)",Author details not found,Author details not found,12,313,<FreqDist with 15 samples and 181 outcomes>
China releases a white paper on its proposals and actions on building a global community of shared future,GT staff reporters,2023-09-26," The Chinese government released a white paper on Tuesday to introduce the theoretical base, practice and development of a global community of shared future, as by presenting China's vision of the course of human development, it counters the hegemonic thinking of certain countries that seek supremacy. The white paper, titled ""A Global Community of Shared Future: China's Proposals and Actions,"" introduced the background for China to raise the concept of a global community of shared future as the world is undergoing changes on a scale unseen in a century with various problems posing unprecedented challenges for human society. The zero-sum game is doomed to fail, the white paper said. But certain countries still cling to this mindset, blindly pursuing absolute security and monopolistic advantages, which will do nothing for their development in the long run but create a major threat to the world. It is increasingly obvious that the obsession with superior strength, and the zero-sum mentality are in conflict with the needs of our times, the white paper said, pointing out that the new era calls for new ideas. To build a global community of shared future is to pursue openness, inclusiveness, mutual benefit, equity and justice, the white paper said. The goal is not to replace one system or civilization with another. Instead, it is about countries with different social systems, ideologies, histories, shared rights, and shared responsibilities in global affairs. The vision of a global community of shared future stands on the right side of history and on the side of human progress. It introduces a new approach for international relations, provides new ideas for global governance, opens up new prospects for international exchanges and draws a new blueprint for a better world, according to the white paper. Such important vision transcends outdated mindsets such as zero-sum game, power politics, and Cold War confrontations. It has become the overall goal of China's major-country diplomacy in the new era, and a great banner that leads the trend of the times and the direction of human progress. The concept of a global community of shared future has deep roots in China's profound cultural heritage and its unique experience of modernization. It carries forward the diplomatic traditions of China and draws on the outstanding achievements of all other civilizations, the white paper said. It also manifests China's time-honored historical traditions, distinct characteristics of the times, and a wealth of humanistic values.  The white paper also pointed out the direction and plan to build a global community of shared future including pressing ahead with a new type of economic globalization in which countries need to pursue a policy of openness and explicitly oppose protectionism, the erection of fences and barriers, unilateral sanctions, and maximum-pressure tactics, so as to connect economies and jointly build an open world economy. Some countries are seeking to decouple from China, enclosing themselves in ""small yards, high fences,"" which will ultimately only backfire, the white paper said. Also, some people overstate the need to ""reduce dependence"" and ""de-risk,"" which is essentially creating new risks. The direction and the plan also include following a peaceful development plan, fostering a new type of international relations, practicing true multilateralism and promoting the common values of humanity. Over the past decade, China has contributed its strength to building a global community of shared future with firm conviction and solid actions. For instance, by July 2023, more than three-quarters of countries in the world and over 30 international organizations had signed agreements on Belt and Road cooperation with China. The BRI originated in China but the opportunities and achievements it creates belong to the whole world. It's an initiative for economic cooperation, not for geopolitical or military alliances, and it's open and inclusive process that neither targets nor excludes any party, the white paper said. Among those BRI projects, for example, the China-Laos Railway began operation on December 3, 2021, with 167 tunnels and 301 bridges built in 11 years along its total length of 1,035 kilometers. The railway construction created more than 110,000 local jobs, and helped build about 2,000 kilometers of roads and canals for villages along the railway, benefiting local people. Besides the BRI, the Global Development Initiative, the Global Security Initiative and Global Civilization Initiative have evolved into a crucial cornerstone for building a global community of shared future, offering China's solutions to major challenges pertaining to peace and development for humanity. Facing constant flare-ups of hotspot issues, China has been committed to fulfilling its role as a responsible major country, pushing for the resolution of international and regional flashpoints, such as the Korean Peninsula, Palestine, the Iranian nuclear issue, Syria and Afghanistan, the white paper said. On the Ukraine issue, China has actively promoted talks for peace, put forth four points, four things that the international community should do together and three observations, and released China's position on the political settlement of the Ukraine crisis and has dispatched the special representative of the Chinese government on Eurasian affairs to engage in extensive interactions and exchanges with stakeholders on the political settlement of the Ukraine crisis. Also, through the mediation of China, Saudi Arabia and Iran achieve historic reconciliation earlier this year, setting a fine example for countries in the region to resolve disputes and differences and achieve good neighborly relations through dialogue and consultation, and catalyzing a wave of reconciliation in the Middle East. China has also proposed a range of regional and bilateral initiatives on building communities of shared future and working with stakeholders to build consensus and expand cooperation, there by playing a constructive role in promoting regional peace and development. It also boosts international cooperation in fields including fighting the COVID-19 pandemic, addressing disorder in cyberspace governance and dealing with the global climate challenge. Over the past decade, the vision of a global community of shared future has gained broader support. More countries and people have come to the understanding that this vision serves the common interests of humanity, represents popular calls for peace, justice and progress, and can create the greatest synergy among all nations for building a better world, the white paper said.",CHINA,POLITICS,Photo: Li Xuanmin/GT,Author details not found,Author details not found,33,1000,<FreqDist with 17 samples and 603 outcomes>

F-35: Closer Look at Colossally Costly Jet That Just Can’t Seem to Stay Airborne,Sputnik,2023-09-21,"A US Marine Corps F-35B went down over South Carolina on Sunday after its pilot ejected mid-flight for reasons unknown. Why do F-35s seem so crash-prone? What’s wrong with them? And what role does the waste and fraud in the US military-industrial complex play in creating such a Frankenstein’s monster of an aircraft? Sputnik explores.Debris from the F-35B that went missing over South Carolina on September 17 was found in Williamsburg County, South Carolina, about two hours northeast of Joint Base Charleston on Monday following more than a day of frantic searching by the military. An as yet unspecified “mishap” was blamed for the accident. The pilot escaped unscathed.“The mishap is currently under investigation, and we are unable to provide additional details to preserve the integrity of the investigative process,” the Marine Corps said in a statement Monday. The Marines ordered a two-day global pause in all aerial operations, with the errant F-35B becoming the third major aviation-related accident suffered by the military branch in less than two months.Air units will be discussing “fundamentals of safe flight operations, ground safety, maintenance and flight procedures, and maintaining combat readiness,” the Marine Corps said.How Many F-35s Have Been Lost?Since it started being introduced into service with the Marines (2015), the US Air Force (2016), and the US Navy (2019) and began to be exported to foreign clients (starting with Israel in 2018), the F-35 has gained an unenviable reputation of being a costly, buggy, and crash-prone jet, with the F-35B that went down over South Carolina last week being at least the 11th Lightning II lost since 2018.On September 28, 2018, a US Marine Corps F-35B crashed during a flight near Marine Corps Air Station Beaufort in South Carolina, with a faulty fuel tube blamed for the incident. The pilot emerged unscathed.On April 9, 2019, a Japanese Self- Defense Force F-35A went down off Honshu, Japan. The pilot was killed after losing his bearings and suffering “special disorientation” mid-flight over the ocean.On May 19, 2020, a US Air Force F-35A from the 58th Fighter Squadron crashed while performing a landing at Eglin Air Force Base in western Florida. Pilot error (trying to land at excessive speed) and a mechanical defect related to a flight control glitch that left the plane’s tail unresponsive were blamed. The pilot survived.On September 29, 2020, a US Marine Corps F-35B was lost over Imperial County, California after colliding with a KC-130 tanker during midflight refueling. The tanker crew managed to bring their aircraft down for a hard landing. The F-35 pilot ejected successfully.On November 17, 2021, a British Royal Air Force F-35B plunged into the Mediterranean Sea after its pilot ejected during routine operations. That crash was ultimately blamed on a protective cover getting wedged into the plane’s engine intake.On January 4, 2022, a South Korean Air Force F-35A suffering from issues with its onboard avionics carried out an emergency belly landing. Investigators blamed a bird striking the warplane’s landing gear mid-flight. The pilot emerged unharmed.On January 24, 2022, a US Navy F-35C plunged into the South China Sea after making a hard landing on the USS Carl Vinson super carrier. The pilot and six sailors on the deck of the aircraft carrier were injured. A Navy investigation attributed the incident to pilot error.On October 19, 2022, another F-35, this one from the US Air Force, crashed at Hill Air Force Base in Utah during a training mission. The pilot ejected safely. It was later determined that turbulent air somehow confused the jet’s onboard avionics to the point where the aircraft became uncontrollable.On December 1, 2022, a Marine Corps F-35B collapsed on a military base in Japan after suffering a landing gear failure during training. No one was injured.Finally, on December 15, 2022, a US Navy F-35B crashed while attempting to perform a vertical landing at Naval Air Station Joint Reserve Base Fort Worth in Texas during testing of the jet’s systems. A “harmonic resonance” issue related to the jet’s Pratt & Whitney F135 engine was blamed, with the Pentagon halting further F-35 deliveries by Lockheed until an investigation was concluded.What’s Wrong With the F-35?Nearly 17 years after the F-35’s first flight, and eight years after its adoption into service, the F-35 continues to maintain a troublingly long list of technical bugs affecting both hardware and software. The aircraft, which has an astronomical total estimated purchase and sustainment price tag of over $1.7 trillion, and a per-plane cost of $70-$90 million, has faced years of harsh criticism from US officials, including former President Donald Trump at one point, who said the jet’s costs had spiraled “out of control.”At its heart, the F-35 is the product of an idea that metastasized in the Pentagon after the end of the Cold War, envisioning an all-in-one fighter platform which could be used by every branch of the military, equipped with vertical take-off and landing capability, and carry out a broad array of missions using a variety of onboard weapons. The do-it-all jet was supposed to replace nearly all of America’s fourth-gen fighter, strike, and ground attack aircraft, including the F-16 Falcon, the F/A-18 Hornet and Super Hornet, the AV-8B Harrier II, and others.The jet features just a single onboard engine – the aforementioned Pratt & Whitney F135, with engine-related troubles not only regularly referred to by watchdogs as a “leading driver” of the F-35’s problems remaining “mission capable,” but also making its operation over enemy territory or over the sea risky, since if something goes wrong, the plane doesn’t have a backup engine to limp home with.Throughout its production cycle, the F-35 Lightning II has suffered a dizzying and seemingly endless list of technical problems, from neck-snapping ejection seats to problems, ironically, while operating in stormy weather.In its 2023 report, the congressional Government Accountability Office revealed that the F-35 program “continues to experience schedule delays, cost growth, and late deliveries,” with procurement costs jumping by $13.4 billion since 2019, and modernization behind schedule and over budget.“As of January 2023, of the 821 open deficiencies, the program office characterized five of these as category 1 [i.e. critical issues which could jeopardize flight safety and security], and 816 as category 2, [i.e. those which could impede or constrain mission success].”In all, between December 2006 and 2023, the GAO has reported a whopping 277 category 1 and 2,467 category 2 deficiencies with the aircraft, among them serious issues like cabin over-pressurization, problems with the jets’ night vision systems, software bugs, radar issues, corrosion, ejection seats which could snap pilots’ necks, etc.Is a Culture of Largess to Blame?Sunday’s accident in South Carolina is the latest piece of F-35-related bad news for Lockheed Martin. In June, it was reported that the Pentagon had halted the delivery of any additional upgraded F-35s until major issues related to new Technology Refresh 3 (TR-3) hardware and weapons-related software were resolved. DoD F-35 program director Mike Schmidt told Congress in March that the risk assessment related to the TR-3 hardware upgrade wouldn’t be finished until April 2024.Despite the delays and array of technical problems, the weapons giant has continued to rack up generous contracts related to F-35 procurement and production. For example, in July, the US Navy ordered a $490 million package of equipment from Lockheed “to procure various material mod kits, special test/tooling equipment, as well as…product engineering” for already delivered, but defective planes. In August, Lockheed received another $606 million “fixed-price incentive (firm-target) undefinitized” contract “for long lead time materials, parts, components, and efforts to support of maintaining on-time production and delivery of 173 Lot 19 F-35 Joint Strike Fighter aircraft for Foreign Military Sales (FMS) customers and non-US Department of Defense (DOD) participants.”The terms of the contracts seem to be the culprit behind the F-35’s soaring costs (and Lockheed’s soaring profits, despite delivery of defective products), with so-called “cost-plus” and “undefinitized” contracts effectively making any overruns the buyer’s problem – i.e. that of US taxpayers, and of citizens of any country unfortunate enough to pen contracts for the planes from Lockheed.What About America’s Competitors?The worst part about the F-35’s troublesome history seems to be that the F-35 has already become ""obsolete"" in the sense that many of the US and NATO’s competitors have obtained the ability to defeat them, with Russia and China gaining capabilities to track and target the jets going back to the mid-to-late 2010s. In April, Iran announced that its engineers had created advanced radar technologies to not only detect F-35s, but identify the radar signature of individual F-35 planes, enabling the Islamic Republic to plan defensive operations accordingly.",WORLD,AMERICAS,Picture description not found,Author details not found,Author details not found,60,1305,<FreqDist with 18 samples and 775 outcomes>
Toxic explosion in Nebraska shows US unable to take issues affecting public security seriously: experts,Xu Yelu,2023-09-15,"Barely two months after an explosion in Louisiana, a train carrying toxic perchloric acid has exploded in a Nebraska rail yard on Thursday, prompting evacuation orders to be issued, as huge plumes are seen engulfing the city. Experts said the incident shows the US has been unable to take seriously and overcome major issues affecting public safety and the environment and ecology in the country.The incident happened on Union Pacific Railroad tracks in the city of North Platte. North Platte Volunteer Fire Department announced that they would order those living in the area to evacuate due to the toxic smoke from the railroad, according to media reports.In a post on social media platforms, it said that ""Emergency evacuation for the area between splinter and front North of railroad track due fire at the railroad involving heavy toxic smoke.""In a statement to DailyMail.com, Union Pacific Railroad said that an explosion occurred inside a container which resulted in several railcars catching fire. The railcar did not derail, the company said, and had been in the yard for several hours.Union Pacific said that one of the containers contained a hazardous chemical called perchloric acid, according to Daily Mail.Perchloric is a hazardous material used in food, drugs and biocidal products, as well as explosives, according to the report.Two months ago, a fire at a Louisiana chemical plant triggered explosions that shook homes several miles away and sent flames and smoke billowing into the air in mid-July, prompting emergency officials to urge a few hundred nearby residents to shelter indoors for several hours and to turn off their air conditioners, the Associated Press reported.Antiquated infrastructure and the outdated transportation were one factor. Another was a flawed system of governance in the US transport industry, experts noted. There is no doubt that the US has serious loopholes in the transportation management of hazardous substances, and the relevant error correction mechanism is in fact not effective, which means that this kind of thing will occur in the future, Li Haidong, a professor at the China Foreign Affairs University, told the Global Times on Friday.This shows that the US has been unable to take seriously and overcome serious and major issues affecting public safety and the environment and ecology in the country, Li said. ""It must be said that this is a great irony to the self-proclaimed internal governance of the most advanced country in the world.""Analysts said that the frequent occurrence of similar incidents shows that the error correction mechanism in the US has failed. Apart from this, racism and the proliferation of guns are also clear examples of the failure of error correction mechanisms, experts noted.",WORLD,AMERICAS,"A resident of East Palestine in the state of Ohio, US, angrily points during a town hall meeting held by the US

Greek scholar believes in ‘endless possibilities and vast land’ between China-Greece exchanges,Xu Liuliu,2023-09-14,"Chongqing, Sichuan, Shandong… Stelios Virvidakis expectantly plans his next China tour before a visit by the Global Times at his office in Athens, Greece. The University of Athens professor has grown far busier recently since he and four other Greek scholars launched the Center of Chinese and Greek Ancient Civilizations in February. Over the summer, the center has received two scholars from China who have given lectures on the history of China, and other visiting guests from places like Israel, who offered their views on Chinese medicine and its history, and a lecturer from France with insights in Chinese mathematics and how scholars in ancient China studied the living science.""Students found them to be very interesting and greatly appreciated the lectures,"" Virvidakis told the Global Times. ""Greece and China share so many similarities. So in my opinion, the horizon for our cooperation and exchanges is vast. There are endless possibilities which have not been explored.""Mutual learning Chinese President Xi Jinping replied to a letter from Virvidakis and four other Greek scholars earlier in 2023, extending congratulations over the founding of the Center of Chinese and Greek Ancient Civilizations.Hailing the long history of the Chinese civilization and profound influence of the ancient Greek civilization, Xi said in the letter that more than 2,000 years ago, the two civilizations shone brightly on the two ends of the Eurasian continent, jointly making a fundamental contribution to the evolution of human civilization.Greece's golden era produced many of its great philosophers and literary giants. The era coincided with a period in China in which ""a hundred schools of thought contended with each other"" and flourished together.As early as the 4th century BC, China was known to the Greeks by a beautiful name: Sērikḗ. In the 16th century, Euclid's Elements was introduced into China, paving the way for scientific exchanges between China and the West. The story of Prometheus narrated by Aeschylus was an inspiration to many Chinese revolutionaries. The Republic by Plato and Politics by Aristotle are also among the Greek classics known to have long made a name for themselves in China.In the eyes of Virvidakis, Chinese civilization has always been a culture that attracts people though the language is difficult. However, Chinese art, Chinese painting, Chinese poetry, especially love poems, even detective stories about China, are incredibly fascinating. Chinese director Zhang Yimou, and movies like Farewell My Concubine and Raise the Red Lantern starring Gong Li, are also very popular. Greek archaeologists who are interested in Chinese archeology want to know how China explores the past.In other art forms, the mythology and theater, ""we have tragedy, which is our own tradition. You have Chinese opera with music."" Actors and artists always want to study similarities and look at the differences, which is also the commitment of the center to promoting exchanges and mutual learning between the two civilizations and promoting the development of civilizations in various countries. China also has this appeal because people in the West think ""it's very different, it's exotic, something strange, but then they realize that it's beautiful for them."" So ""they find a lot of aspects that they have not thought about before in order to understand.""

Tiantan, a UNESCO World Heritage Site built in 1420, in Beijing Photo: VCGPhilosophy, a way of life There is a feeling among some people in the West that the Chinese system is different in some ways, said the professor. For instance,the European and American systems place great emphasis on individual rights, but China takes a more holistic approach in which ""harmony, social harmony is more important in sovereign.""""We are not exactly the same and there are also differences. But I don't believe in the so-called clash of civilizations theory that the clash is very deep and we can't live together with our differences,"" he told the Global Times. ""In fact we can live together and have peaceful exchanges. As I said, I don't think there is any danger of Greece threatening China or China occupying Greece.""In February, Virvidakis held a lecture at the center's launching ceremony, titled Philosophy is a Way of Life. Philosophy is not just theory, he said, noting that in ancient Greece and China it didn't mean just making theories about the universe, nature, god, or much of the unknown world. ""It told you how to 'organize' your life to feel happy and achieve harmony with others."" Western philosophy cannot be understood just by itself as there are also Chinese and Indian schools of philosophy among others. ""It is easier to see some similarities in ideas between Confucius and Socrates or Confucius and Aristotle,"" said Virvidakis, explaining why he is so fond of Chinese philosophy, especially Confucius thought. A simple question about what is a good life has a variety of answers in different philosophical theories.  But studying philosophy is practical and a way of life. Modern people don't just derive happiness from materialism. They need art and other emotionally stirring elements in life. In different parts and different cultures of the world,people can share similarities in emotion and sentiment.Virvidakis said that one of the most important reasons for his involving in such studies and exchanges was because ""I'm interested and I want to learn more. I'm a student too. When you are a teacher in your whole life, you're going to be a student.""",ARTS,CULTURE & LEISURE,The University of Athens Photo: VCG,"Reporter, Beijing","Global Times senior reporter, mainly covers the reporting of movies, TV, music and culture news.",43,880,<FreqDist with 16 samples and 473 outcomes>

 The first Saudi ambassador to Palestine Naif bin Bandar Al-Sudairi arrived in the West Bank on Tuesday, the official Palestinian news agency WAFA reported.Leading an official delegation, Al-Sudairi, the non-resident ambassador to Palestine and non-resident consul general in Jerusalem, presented his credentials to Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas at the presidency headquarters in Ramallah, it said.Al-Sudairi's arrival comes amid Israel's efforts to normalize relations with Saudi Arabia.During their meeting, Abbas welcomed Al-Sudairi and said his visit to Palestine and his appointment as Saudi ambassador to the State of Palestine would contribute to ""strengthening the strong fraternal relations that bind the two countries and the two brotherly peoples.""The Saudi ambassador said he hoped that his visit would be ""a successful beginning for strengthening relations in all fields,"" stressing his country's firm and supportive positions for the Palestinian people and their just cause.Earlier in the day, Al-Sudairi told reporters in a statement that ""the Arab Peace Initiative is the basic point in any upcoming agreement,"" after being asked about the fate of the initiative in the event of reaching a normalization deal between Saudi Arabia and Israel.The Arab Peace Initiative was launched in 2002 after it was drafted by Saudi Arabia and adopted by the Arab League.The initiative calls for an end to the conflict between Israel and Palestine and the normalization of relations between Israel and Arab states, in exchange for an Israeli withdrawal from the areas it gained since 1967 and proper settlement to the issue of Palestinian refugees.The Palestinians demanded the establishment of an independent state alongside Israel in all of the Palestinian territories occupied by Israel in 1967, including the entire West Bank and the Gaza Strip, with East Jerusalem as its capital.The Saudi ambassador also confirmed that his country intends to open a consulate in East Jerusalem soon.",PHOTO,WORLD,"Saudi ambassador to Palestine Naif bin Bandar Al-Sudairi (Front) arrives at the Palestinian foreign ministry headquarters in the West Bank city of Ramallah, on Sept. 26, 2023.(Photo: Xinhua)",Author details not found,Author details not found,12,313,<FreqDist with 15 samples and 181 outcomes>
China releases a white paper on its proposals and actions on building a global community of shared future,GT staff reporters,2023-09-26," The Chinese government released a white paper on Tuesday to introduce the theoretical base, practice and development of a global community of shared future, as by presenting China's vision of the course of human development, it counters the hegemonic thinking of certain countries that seek supremacy. The white paper, titled ""A Global Community of Shared Future: China's Proposals and Actions,"" introduced the background for China to raise the concept of a global community of shared future as the world is undergoing changes on a scale unseen in a century with various problems posing unprecedented challenges for human society. The zero-sum game is doomed to fail, the white paper said. But certain countries still cling to this mindset, blindly pursuing absolute security and monopolistic advantages, which will do nothing for their development in the long run but create a major threat to the world. It is increasingly obvious that the obsession with superior strength, and the zero-sum mentality are in conflict with the needs of our times, the white paper said, pointing out that the new era calls for new ideas. To build a global community of shared future is to pursue openness, inclusiveness, mutual benefit, equity and justice, the white paper said. The goal is not to replace one system or civilization with another. Instead, it is about countries with different social systems, ideologies, histories, shared rights, and shared responsibilities in global affairs. The vision of a global community of shared future stands on the right side of history and on the side of human progress. It introduces a new approach for international relations, provides new ideas for global governance, opens up new prospects for international exchanges and draws a new blueprint for a better world, according to the white paper. Such important vision transcends outdated mindsets such as zero-sum game, power politics, and Cold War confrontations. It has become the overall goal of China's major-country diplomacy in the new era, and a great banner that leads the trend of the times and the direction of human progress. The concept of a global community of shared future has deep roots in China's profound cultural heritage and its unique experience of modernization. It carries forward the diplomatic traditions of China and draws on the outstanding achievements of all other civilizations, the white paper said. It also manifests China's time-honored historical traditions, distinct characteristics of the times, and a wealth of humanistic values.  The white paper also pointed out the direction and plan to build a global community of shared future including pressing ahead with a new type of economic globalization in which countries need to pursue a policy of openness and explicitly oppose protectionism, the erection of fences and barriers, unilateral sanctions, and maximum-pressure tactics, so as to connect economies and jointly build an open world economy. Some countries are seeking to decouple from China, enclosing themselves in ""small yards, high fences,"" which will ultimately only backfire, the white paper said. Also, some people overstate the need to ""reduce dependence"" and ""de-risk,"" which is essentially creating new risks. The direction and the plan also include following a peaceful development plan, fostering a new type of international relations, practicing true multilateralism and promoting the common values of humanity. Over the past decade, China has contributed its strength to building a global community of shared future with firm conviction and solid actions. For instance, by July 2023, more than three-quarters of countries in the world and over 30 international organizations had signed agreements on Belt and Road cooperation with China. The BRI originated in China but the opportunities and achievements it creates belong to the whole world. It's an initiative for economic cooperation, not for geopolitical or military alliances, and it's open and inclusive process that neither targets nor excludes any party, the white paper said. Among those BRI projects, for example, the China-Laos Railway began operation on December 3, 2021, with 167 tunnels and 301 bridges built in 11 years along its total length of 1,035 kilometers. The railway construction created more than 110,000 local jobs, and helped build about 2,000 kilometers of roads and canals for villages along the railway, benefiting local people. Besides the BRI, the Global Development Initiative, the Global Security Initiative and Global Civilization Initiative have evolved into a crucial cornerstone for building a global community of shared future, offering China's solutions to major challenges pertaining to peace and development for humanity. Facing constant flare-ups of hotspot issues, China has been committed to fulfilling its role as a responsible major country, pushing for the resolution of international and regional flashpoints, such as the Korean Peninsula, Palestine, the Iranian nuclear issue, Syria and Afghanistan, the white paper said. On the Ukraine issue, China has actively promoted talks for peace, put forth four points, four things that the international community should do together and three observations, and released China's position on the political settlement of the Ukraine crisis and has dispatched the special representative of the Chinese government on Eurasian affairs to engage in extensive interactions and exchanges with stakeholders on the political settlement of the Ukraine crisis. Also, through the mediation of China, Saudi Arabia and Iran achieve historic reconciliation earlier this year, setting a fine example for countries in the region to resolve disputes and differences and achieve good neighborly relations through dialogue and consultation, and catalyzing a wave of reconciliation in the Middle East. China has also proposed a range of regional and bilateral initiatives on building communities of shared future and working with stakeholders to build consensus and expand cooperation, there by playing a constructive role in promoting regional peace and development. It also boosts international cooperation in fields including fighting the COVID-19 pandemic, addressing disorder in cyberspace governance and dealing with the global climate challenge. Over the past decade, the vision of a global community of shared future has gained broader support. More countries and people have come to the understanding that this vision serves the common interests of humanity, represents popular calls for peace, justice and progress, and can create the greatest synergy among all nations for building a better world, the white paper said.",CHINA,POLITICS,Photo: Li Xuanmin/GT,Author details not found,Author details not found,33,1000,<FreqDist with 17 samples and 603 outcomes>

F-35: Closer Look at Colossally Costly Jet That Just Can’t Seem to Stay Airborne,Sputnik,2023-09-21,"A US Marine Corps F-35B went down over South Carolina on Sunday after its pilot ejected mid-flight for reasons unknown. Why do F-35s seem so crash-prone? What’s wrong with them? And what role does the waste and fraud in the US military-industrial complex play in creating such a Frankenstein’s monster of an aircraft? Sputnik explores.Debris from the F-35B that went missing over South Carolina on September 17 was found in Williamsburg County, South Carolina, about two hours northeast of Joint Base Charleston on Monday following more than a day of frantic searching by the military. An as yet unspecified “mishap” was blamed for the accident. The pilot escaped unscathed.“The mishap is currently under investigation, and we are unable to provide additional details to preserve the integrity of the investigative process,” the Marine Corps said in a statement Monday. The Marines ordered a two-day global pause in all aerial operations, with the errant F-35B becoming the third major aviation-related accident suffered by the military branch in less than two months.Air units will be discussing “fundamentals of safe flight operations, ground safety, maintenance and flight procedures, and maintaining combat readiness,” the Marine Corps said.How Many F-35s Have Been Lost?Since it started being introduced into service with the Marines (2015), the US Air Force (2016), and the US Navy (2019) and began to be exported to foreign clients (starting with Israel in 2018), the F-35 has gained an unenviable reputation of being a costly, buggy, and crash-prone jet, with the F-35B that went down over South Carolina last week being at least the 11th Lightning II lost since 2018.On September 28, 2018, a US Marine Corps F-35B crashed during a flight near Marine Corps Air Station Beaufort in South Carolina, with a faulty fuel tube blamed for the incident. The pilot emerged unscathed.On April 9, 2019, a Japanese Self- Defense Force F-35A went down off Honshu, Japan. The pilot was killed after losing his bearings and suffering “special disorientation” mid-flight over the ocean.On May 19, 2020, a US Air Force F-35A from the 58th Fighter Squadron crashed while performing a landing at Eglin Air Force Base in western Florida. Pilot error (trying to land at excessive speed) and a mechanical defect related to a flight control glitch that left the plane’s tail unresponsive were blamed. The pilot survived.On September 29, 2020, a US Marine Corps F-35B was lost over Imperial County, California after colliding with a KC-130 tanker during midflight refueling. The tanker crew managed to bring their aircraft down for a hard landing. The F-35 pilot ejected successfully.On November 17, 2021, a British Royal Air Force F-35B plunged into the Mediterranean Sea after its pilot ejected during routine operations. That crash was ultimately blamed on a protective cover getting wedged into the plane’s engine intake.On January 4, 2022, a South Korean Air Force F-35A suffering from issues with its onboard avionics carried out an emergency belly landing. Investigators blamed a bird striking the warplane’s landing gear mid-flight. The pilot emerged unharmed.On January 24, 2022, a US Navy F-35C plunged into the South China Sea after making a hard landing on the USS Carl Vinson super carrier. The pilot and six sailors on the deck of the aircraft carrier were injured. A Navy investigation attributed the incident to pilot error.On October 19, 2022, another F-35, this one from the US Air Force, crashed at Hill Air Force Base in Utah during a training mission. The pilot ejected safely. It was later determined that turbulent air somehow confused the jet’s onboard avionics to the point where the aircraft became uncontrollable.On December 1, 2022, a Marine Corps F-35B collapsed on a military base in Japan after suffering a landing gear failure during training. No one was injured.Finally, on December 15, 2022, a US Navy F-35B crashed while attempting to perform a vertical landing at Naval Air Station Joint Reserve Base Fort Worth in Texas during testing of the jet’s systems. A “harmonic resonance” issue related to the jet’s Pratt & Whitney F135 engine was blamed, with the Pentagon halting further F-35 deliveries by Lockheed until an investigation was concluded.What’s Wrong With the F-35?Nearly 17 years after the F-35’s first flight, and eight years after its adoption into service, the F-35 continues to maintain a troublingly long list of technical bugs affecting both hardware and software. The aircraft, which has an astronomical total estimated purchase and sustainment price tag of over $1.7 trillion, and a per-plane cost of $70-$90 million, has faced years of harsh criticism from US officials, including former President Donald Trump at one point, who said the jet’s costs had spiraled “out of control.”At its heart, the F-35 is the product of an idea that metastasized in the Pentagon after the end of the Cold War, envisioning an all-in-one fighter platform which could be used by every branch of the military, equipped with vertical take-off and landing capability, and carry out a broad array of missions using a variety of onboard weapons. The do-it-all jet was supposed to replace nearly all of America’s fourth-gen fighter, strike, and ground attack aircraft, including the F-16 Falcon, the F/A-18 Hornet and Super Hornet, the AV-8B Harrier II, and others.The jet features just a single onboard engine – the aforementioned Pratt & Whitney F135, with engine-related troubles not only regularly referred to by watchdogs as a “leading driver” of the F-35’s problems remaining “mission capable,” but also making its operation over enemy territory or over the sea risky, since if something goes wrong, the plane doesn’t have a backup engine to limp home with.Throughout its production cycle, the F-35 Lightning II has suffered a dizzying and seemingly endless list of technical problems, from neck-snapping ejection seats to problems, ironically, while operating in stormy weather.In its 2023 report, the congressional Government Accountability Office revealed that the F-35 program “continues to experience schedule delays, cost growth, and late deliveries,” with procurement costs jumping by $13.4 billion since 2019, and modernization behind schedule and over budget.“As of January 2023, of the 821 open deficiencies, the program office characterized five of these as category 1 [i.e. critical issues which could jeopardize flight safety and security], and 816 as category 2, [i.e. those which could impede or constrain mission success].”In all, between December 2006 and 2023, the GAO has reported a whopping 277 category 1 and 2,467 category 2 deficiencies with the aircraft, among them serious issues like cabin over-pressurization, problems with the jets’ night vision systems, software bugs, radar issues, corrosion, ejection seats which could snap pilots’ necks, etc.Is a Culture of Largess to Blame?Sunday’s accident in South Carolina is the latest piece of F-35-related bad news for Lockheed Martin. In June, it was reported that the Pentagon had halted the delivery of any additional upgraded F-35s until major issues related to new Technology Refresh 3 (TR-3) hardware and weapons-related software were resolved. DoD F-35 program director Mike Schmidt told Congress in March that the risk assessment related to the TR-3 hardware upgrade wouldn’t be finished until April 2024.Despite the delays and array of technical problems, the weapons giant has continued to rack up generous contracts related to F-35 procurement and production. For example, in July, the US Navy ordered a $490 million package of equipment from Lockheed “to procure various material mod kits, special test/tooling equipment, as well as…product engineering” for already delivered, but defective planes. In August, Lockheed received another $606 million “fixed-price incentive (firm-target) undefinitized” contract “for long lead time materials, parts, components, and efforts to support of maintaining on-time production and delivery of 173 Lot 19 F-35 Joint Strike Fighter aircraft for Foreign Military Sales (FMS) customers and non-US Department of Defense (DOD) participants.”The terms of the contracts seem to be the culprit behind the F-35’s soaring costs (and Lockheed’s soaring profits, despite delivery of defective products), with so-called “cost-plus” and “undefinitized” contracts effectively making any overruns the buyer’s problem – i.e. that of US taxpayers, and of citizens of any country unfortunate enough to pen contracts for the planes from Lockheed.What About America’s Competitors?The worst part about the F-35’s troublesome history seems to be that the F-35 has already become ""obsolete"" in the sense that many of the US and NATO’s competitors have obtained the ability to defeat them, with Russia and China gaining capabilities to track and target the jets going back to the mid-to-late 2010s. In April, Iran announced that its engineers had created advanced radar technologies to not only detect F-35s, but identify the radar signature of individual F-35 planes, enabling the Islamic Republic to plan defensive operations accordingly.",WORLD,AMERICAS,Picture description not found,Author details not found,Author details not found,60,1305,<FreqDist with 18 samples and 775 outcomes>
Toxic explosion in Nebraska shows US unable to take issues affecting public security seriously: experts,Xu Yelu,2023-09-15,"Barely two months after an explosion in Louisiana, a train carrying toxic perchloric acid has exploded in a Nebraska rail yard on Thursday, prompting evacuation orders to be issued, as huge plumes are seen engulfing the city. Experts said the incident shows the US has been unable to take seriously and overcome major issues affecting public safety and the environment and ecology in the country.The incident happened on Union Pacific Railroad tracks in the city of North Platte. North Platte Volunteer Fire Department announced that they would order those living in the area to evacuate due to the toxic smoke from the railroad, according to media reports.In a post on social media platforms, it said that ""Emergency evacuation for the area between splinter and front North of railroad track due fire at the railroad involving heavy toxic smoke.""In a statement to DailyMail.com, Union Pacific Railroad said that an explosion occurred inside a container which resulted in several railcars catching fire. The railcar did not derail, the company said, and had been in the yard for several hours.Union Pacific said that one of the containers contained a hazardous chemical called perchloric acid, according to Daily Mail.Perchloric is a hazardous material used in food, drugs and biocidal products, as well as explosives, according to the report.Two months ago, a fire at a Louisiana chemical plant triggered explosions that shook homes several miles away and sent flames and smoke billowing into the air in mid-July, prompting emergency officials to urge a few hundred nearby residents to shelter indoors for several hours and to turn off their air conditioners, the Associated Press reported.Antiquated infrastructure and the outdated transportation were one factor. Another was a flawed system of governance in the US transport industry, experts noted. There is no doubt that the US has serious loopholes in the transportation management of hazardous substances, and the relevant error correction mechanism is in fact not effective, which means that this kind of thing will occur in the future, Li Haidong, a professor at the China Foreign Affairs University, told the Global Times on Friday.This shows that the US has been unable to take seriously and overcome serious and major issues affecting public safety and the environment and ecology in the country, Li said. ""It must be said that this is a great irony to the self-proclaimed internal governance of the most advanced country in the world.""Analysts said that the frequent occurrence of similar incidents shows that the error correction mechanism in the US has failed. Apart from this, racism and the proliferation of guns are also clear examples of the failure of error correction mechanisms, experts noted.",WORLD,AMERICAS,"A resident of East Palestine in the state of Ohio, US, angrily points during a town hall meeting held by the US

Greek scholar believes in ‘endless possibilities and vast land’ between China-Greece exchanges,Xu Liuliu,2023-09-14,"Chongqing, Sichuan, Shandong… Stelios Virvidakis expectantly plans his next China tour before a visit by the Global Times at his office in Athens, Greece. The University of Athens professor has grown far busier recently since he and four other Greek scholars launched the Center of Chinese and Greek Ancient Civilizations in February. Over the summer, the center has received two scholars from China who have given lectures on the history of China, and other visiting guests from places like Israel, who offered their views on Chinese medicine and its history, and a lecturer from France with insights in Chinese mathematics and how scholars in ancient China studied the living science.""Students found them to be very interesting and greatly appreciated the lectures,"" Virvidakis told the Global Times. ""Greece and China share so many similarities. So in my opinion, the horizon for our cooperation and exchanges is vast. There are endless possibilities which have not been explored.""Mutual learning Chinese President Xi Jinping replied to a letter from Virvidakis and four other Greek scholars earlier in 2023, extending congratulations over the founding of the Center of Chinese and Greek Ancient Civilizations.Hailing the long history of the Chinese civilization and profound influence of the ancient Greek civilization, Xi said in the letter that more than 2,000 years ago, the two civilizations shone brightly on the two ends of the Eurasian continent, jointly making a fundamental contribution to the evolution of human civilization.Greece's golden era produced many of its great philosophers and literary giants. The era coincided with a period in China in which ""a hundred schools of thought contended with each other"" and flourished together.As early as the 4th century BC, China was known to the Greeks by a beautiful name: Sērikḗ. In the 16th century, Euclid's Elements was introduced into China, paving the way for scientific exchanges between China and the West. The story of Prometheus narrated by Aeschylus was an inspiration to many Chinese revolutionaries. The Republic by Plato and Politics by Aristotle are also among the Greek classics known to have long made a name for themselves in China.In the eyes of Virvidakis, Chinese civilization has always been a culture that attracts people though the language is difficult. However, Chinese art, Chinese painting, Chinese poetry, especially love poems, even detective stories about China, are incredibly fascinating. Chinese director Zhang Yimou, and movies like Farewell My Concubine and Raise the Red Lantern starring Gong Li, are also very popular. Greek archaeologists who are interested in Chinese archeology want to know how China explores the past.In other art forms, the mythology and theater, ""we have tragedy, which is our own tradition. You have Chinese opera with music."" Actors and artists always want to study similarities and look at the differences, which is also the commitment of the center to promoting exchanges and mutual learning between the two civilizations and promoting the development of civilizations in various countries. China also has this appeal because people in the West think ""it's very different, it's exotic, something strange, but then they realize that it's beautiful for them."" So ""they find a lot of aspects that they have not thought about before in order to understand.""

Tiantan, a UNESCO World Heritage Site built in 1420, in Beijing Photo: VCGPhilosophy, a way of life There is a feeling among some people in the West that the Chinese system is different in some ways, said the professor. For instance,the European and American systems place great emphasis on individual rights, but China takes a more holistic approach in which ""harmony, social harmony is more important in sovereign.""""We are not exactly the same and there are also differences. But I don't believe in the so-called clash of civilizations theory that the clash is very deep and we can't live together with our differences,"" he told the Global Times. ""In fact we can live together and have peaceful exchanges. As I said, I don't think there is any danger of Greece threatening China or China occupying Greece.""In February, Virvidakis held a lecture at the center's launching ceremony, titled Philosophy is a Way of Life. Philosophy is not just theory, he said, noting that in ancient Greece and China it didn't mean just making theories about the universe, nature, god, or much of the unknown world. ""It told you how to 'organize' your life to feel happy and achieve harmony with others."" Western philosophy cannot be understood just by itself as there are also Chinese and Indian schools of philosophy among others. ""It is easier to see some similarities in ideas between Confucius and Socrates or Confucius and Aristotle,"" said Virvidakis, explaining why he is so fond of Chinese philosophy, especially Confucius thought. A simple question about what is a good life has a variety of answers in different philosophical theories.  But studying philosophy is practical and a way of life. Modern people don't just derive happiness from materialism. They need art and other emotionally stirring elements in life. In different parts and different cultures of the world,people can share similarities in emotion and sentiment.Virvidakis said that one of the most important reasons for his involving in such studies and exchanges was because ""I'm interested and I want to learn more. I'm a student too. When you are a teacher in your whole life, you're going to be a student.""",ARTS,CULTURE & LEISURE,The University of Athens Photo: VCG,"Reporter, Beijing","Global Times senior reporter, mainly covers the reporting of movies, TV, music and culture news.",43,880,<FreqDist with 16 samples and 473 outcomes>

 The first Saudi ambassador to Palestine Naif bin Bandar Al-Sudairi arrived in the West Bank on Tuesday, the official Palestinian news agency WAFA reported.Leading an official delegation, Al-Sudairi, the non-resident ambassador to Palestine and non-resident consul general in Jerusalem, presented his credentials to Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas at the presidency headquarters in Ramallah, it said.Al-Sudairi's arrival comes amid Israel's efforts to normalize relations with Saudi Arabia.During their meeting, Abbas welcomed Al-Sudairi and said his visit to Palestine and his appointment as Saudi ambassador to the State of Palestine would contribute to ""strengthening the strong fraternal relations that bind the two countries and the two brotherly peoples.""The Saudi ambassador said he hoped that his visit would be ""a successful beginning for strengthening relations in all fields,"" stressing his country's firm and supportive positions for the Palestinian people and their just cause.Earlier in the day, Al-Sudairi told reporters in a statement that ""the Arab Peace Initiative is the basic point in any upcoming agreement,"" after being asked about the fate of the initiative in the event of reaching a normalization deal between Saudi Arabia and Israel.The Arab Peace Initiative was launched in 2002 after it was drafted by Saudi Arabia and adopted by the Arab League.The initiative calls for an end to the conflict between Israel and Palestine and the normalization of relations between Israel and Arab states, in exchange for an Israeli withdrawal from the areas it gained since 1967 and proper settlement to the issue of Palestinian refugees.The Palestinians demanded the establishment of an independent state alongside Israel in all of the Palestinian territories occupied by Israel in 1967, including the entire West Bank and the Gaza Strip, with East Jerusalem as its capital.The Saudi ambassador also confirmed that his country intends to open a consulate in East Jerusalem soon.",PHOTO,WORLD,"Saudi ambassador to Palestine Naif bin Bandar Al-Sudairi (Front) arrives at the Palestinian foreign ministry headquarters in the West Bank city of Ramallah, on Sept. 26, 2023.(Photo: Xinhua)",Author details not found,Author details not found,12,313,<FreqDist with 15 samples and 181 outcomes>
China releases a white paper on its proposals and actions on building a global community of shared future,GT staff reporters,2023-09-26," The Chinese government released a white paper on Tuesday to introduce the theoretical base, practice and development of a global community of shared future, as by presenting China's vision of the course of human development, it counters the hegemonic thinking of certain countries that seek supremacy. The white paper, titled ""A Global Community of Shared Future: China's Proposals and Actions,"" introduced the background for China to raise the concept of a global community of shared future as the world is undergoing changes on a scale unseen in a century with various problems posing unprecedented challenges for human society. The zero-sum game is doomed to fail, the white paper said. But certain countries still cling to this mindset, blindly pursuing absolute security and monopolistic advantages, which will do nothing for their development in the long run but create a major threat to the world. It is increasingly obvious that the obsession with superior strength, and the zero-sum mentality are in conflict with the needs of our times, the white paper said, pointing out that the new era calls for new ideas. To build a global community of shared future is to pursue openness, inclusiveness, mutual benefit, equity and justice, the white paper said. The goal is not to replace one system or civilization with another. Instead, it is about countries with different social systems, ideologies, histories, shared rights, and shared responsibilities in global affairs. The vision of a global community of shared future stands on the right side of history and on the side of human progress. It introduces a new approach for international relations, provides new ideas for global governance, opens up new prospects for international exchanges and draws a new blueprint for a better world, according to the white paper. Such important vision transcends outdated mindsets such as zero-sum game, power politics, and Cold War confrontations. It has become the overall goal of China's major-country diplomacy in the new era, and a great banner that leads the trend of the times and the direction of human progress. The concept of a global community of shared future has deep roots in China's profound cultural heritage and its unique experience of modernization. It carries forward the diplomatic traditions of China and draws on the outstanding achievements of all other civilizations, the white paper said. It also manifests China's time-honored historical traditions, distinct characteristics of the times, and a wealth of humanistic values.  The white paper also pointed out the direction and plan to build a global community of shared future including pressing ahead with a new type of economic globalization in which countries need to pursue a policy of openness and explicitly oppose protectionism, the erection of fences and barriers, unilateral sanctions, and maximum-pressure tactics, so as to connect economies and jointly build an open world economy. Some countries are seeking to decouple from China, enclosing themselves in ""small yards, high fences,"" which will ultimately only backfire, the white paper said. Also, some people overstate the need to ""reduce dependence"" and ""de-risk,"" which is essentially creating new risks. The direction and the plan also include following a peaceful development plan, fostering a new type of international relations, practicing true multilateralism and promoting the common values of humanity. Over the past decade, China has contributed its strength to building a global community of shared future with firm conviction and solid actions. For instance, by July 2023, more than three-quarters of countries in the world and over 30 international organizations had signed agreements on Belt and Road cooperation with China. The BRI originated in China but the opportunities and achievements it creates belong to the whole world. It's an initiative for economic cooperation, not for geopolitical or military alliances, and it's open and inclusive process that neither targets nor excludes any party, the white paper said. Among those BRI projects, for example, the China-Laos Railway began operation on December 3, 2021, with 167 tunnels and 301 bridges built in 11 years along its total length of 1,035 kilometers. The railway construction created more than 110,000 local jobs, and helped build about 2,000 kilometers of roads and canals for villages along the railway, benefiting local people. Besides the BRI, the Global Development Initiative, the Global Security Initiative and Global Civilization Initiative have evolved into a crucial cornerstone for building a global community of shared future, offering China's solutions to major challenges pertaining to peace and development for humanity. Facing constant flare-ups of hotspot issues, China has been committed to fulfilling its role as a responsible major country, pushing for the resolution of international and regional flashpoints, such as the Korean Peninsula, Palestine, the Iranian nuclear issue, Syria and Afghanistan, the white paper said. On the Ukraine issue, China has actively promoted talks for peace, put forth four points, four things that the international community should do together and three observations, and released China's position on the political settlement of the Ukraine crisis and has dispatched the special representative of the Chinese government on Eurasian affairs to engage in extensive interactions and exchanges with stakeholders on the political settlement of the Ukraine crisis. Also, through the mediation of China, Saudi Arabia and Iran achieve historic reconciliation earlier this year, setting a fine example for countries in the region to resolve disputes and differences and achieve good neighborly relations through dialogue and consultation, and catalyzing a wave of reconciliation in the Middle East. China has also proposed a range of regional and bilateral initiatives on building communities of shared future and working with stakeholders to build consensus and expand cooperation, there by playing a constructive role in promoting regional peace and development. It also boosts international cooperation in fields including fighting the COVID-19 pandemic, addressing disorder in cyberspace governance and dealing with the global climate challenge. Over the past decade, the vision of a global community of shared future has gained broader support. More countries and people have come to the understanding that this vision serves the common interests of humanity, represents popular calls for peace, justice and progress, and can create the greatest synergy among all nations for building a better world, the white paper said.",CHINA,POLITICS,Photo: Li Xuanmin/GT,Author details not found,Author details not found,33,1000,<FreqDist with 17 samples and 603 outcomes>

F-35: Closer Look at Colossally Costly Jet That Just Can’t Seem to Stay Airborne,Sputnik,2023-09-21,"A US Marine Corps F-35B went down over South Carolina on Sunday after its pilot ejected mid-flight for reasons unknown. Why do F-35s seem so crash-prone? What’s wrong with them? And what role does the waste and fraud in the US military-industrial complex play in creating such a Frankenstein’s monster of an aircraft? Sputnik explores.Debris from the F-35B that went missing over South Carolina on September 17 was found in Williamsburg County, South Carolina, about two hours northeast of Joint Base Charleston on Monday following more than a day of frantic searching by the military. An as yet unspecified “mishap” was blamed for the accident. The pilot escaped unscathed.“The mishap is currently under investigation, and we are unable to provide additional details to preserve the integrity of the investigative process,” the Marine Corps said in a statement Monday. The Marines ordered a two-day global pause in all aerial operations, with the errant F-35B becoming the third major aviation-related accident suffered by the military branch in less than two months.Air units will be discussing “fundamentals of safe flight operations, ground safety, maintenance and flight procedures, and maintaining combat readiness,” the Marine Corps said.How Many F-35s Have Been Lost?Since it started being introduced into service with the Marines (2015), the US Air Force (2016), and the US Navy (2019) and began to be exported to foreign clients (starting with Israel in 2018), the F-35 has gained an unenviable reputation of being a costly, buggy, and crash-prone jet, with the F-35B that went down over South Carolina last week being at least the 11th Lightning II lost since 2018.On September 28, 2018, a US Marine Corps F-35B crashed during a flight near Marine Corps Air Station Beaufort in South Carolina, with a faulty fuel tube blamed for the incident. The pilot emerged unscathed.On April 9, 2019, a Japanese Self- Defense Force F-35A went down off Honshu, Japan. The pilot was killed after losing his bearings and suffering “special disorientation” mid-flight over the ocean.On May 19, 2020, a US Air Force F-35A from the 58th Fighter Squadron crashed while performing a landing at Eglin Air Force Base in western Florida. Pilot error (trying to land at excessive speed) and a mechanical defect related to a flight control glitch that left the plane’s tail unresponsive were blamed. The pilot survived.On September 29, 2020, a US Marine Corps F-35B was lost over Imperial County, California after colliding with a KC-130 tanker during midflight refueling. The tanker crew managed to bring their aircraft down for a hard landing. The F-35 pilot ejected successfully.On November 17, 2021, a British Royal Air Force F-35B plunged into the Mediterranean Sea after its pilot ejected during routine operations. That crash was ultimately blamed on a protective cover getting wedged into the plane’s engine intake.On January 4, 2022, a South Korean Air Force F-35A suffering from issues with its onboard avionics carried out an emergency belly landing. Investigators blamed a bird striking the warplane’s landing gear mid-flight. The pilot emerged unharmed.On January 24, 2022, a US Navy F-35C plunged into the South China Sea after making a hard landing on the USS Carl Vinson super carrier. The pilot and six sailors on the deck of the aircraft carrier were injured. A Navy investigation attributed the incident to pilot error.On October 19, 2022, another F-35, this one from the US Air Force, crashed at Hill Air Force Base in Utah during a training mission. The pilot ejected safely. It was later determined that turbulent air somehow confused the jet’s onboard avionics to the point where the aircraft became uncontrollable.On December 1, 2022, a Marine Corps F-35B collapsed on a military base in Japan after suffering a landing gear failure during training. No one was injured.Finally, on December 15, 2022, a US Navy F-35B crashed while attempting to perform a vertical landing at Naval Air Station Joint Reserve Base Fort Worth in Texas during testing of the jet’s systems. A “harmonic resonance” issue related to the jet’s Pratt & Whitney F135 engine was blamed, with the Pentagon halting further F-35 deliveries by Lockheed until an investigation was concluded.What’s Wrong With the F-35?Nearly 17 years after the F-35’s first flight, and eight years after its adoption into service, the F-35 continues to maintain a troublingly long list of technical bugs affecting both hardware and software. The aircraft, which has an astronomical total estimated purchase and sustainment price tag of over $1.7 trillion, and a per-plane cost of $70-$90 million, has faced years of harsh criticism from US officials, including former President Donald Trump at one point, who said the jet’s costs had spiraled “out of control.”At its heart, the F-35 is the product of an idea that metastasized in the Pentagon after the end of the Cold War, envisioning an all-in-one fighter platform which could be used by every branch of the military, equipped with vertical take-off and landing capability, and carry out a broad array of missions using a variety of onboard weapons. The do-it-all jet was supposed to replace nearly all of America’s fourth-gen fighter, strike, and ground attack aircraft, including the F-16 Falcon, the F/A-18 Hornet and Super Hornet, the AV-8B Harrier II, and others.The jet features just a single onboard engine – the aforementioned Pratt & Whitney F135, with engine-related troubles not only regularly referred to by watchdogs as a “leading driver” of the F-35’s problems remaining “mission capable,” but also making its operation over enemy territory or over the sea risky, since if something goes wrong, the plane doesn’t have a backup engine to limp home with.Throughout its production cycle, the F-35 Lightning II has suffered a dizzying and seemingly endless list of technical problems, from neck-snapping ejection seats to problems, ironically, while operating in stormy weather.In its 2023 report, the congressional Government Accountability Office revealed that the F-35 program “continues to experience schedule delays, cost growth, and late deliveries,” with procurement costs jumping by $13.4 billion since 2019, and modernization behind schedule and over budget.“As of January 2023, of the 821 open deficiencies, the program office characterized five of these as category 1 [i.e. critical issues which could jeopardize flight safety and security], and 816 as category 2, [i.e. those which could impede or constrain mission success].”In all, between December 2006 and 2023, the GAO has reported a whopping 277 category 1 and 2,467 category 2 deficiencies with the aircraft, among them serious issues like cabin over-pressurization, problems with the jets’ night vision systems, software bugs, radar issues, corrosion, ejection seats which could snap pilots’ necks, etc.Is a Culture of Largess to Blame?Sunday’s accident in South Carolina is the latest piece of F-35-related bad news for Lockheed Martin. In June, it was reported that the Pentagon had halted the delivery of any additional upgraded F-35s until major issues related to new Technology Refresh 3 (TR-3) hardware and weapons-related software were resolved. DoD F-35 program director Mike Schmidt told Congress in March that the risk assessment related to the TR-3 hardware upgrade wouldn’t be finished until April 2024.Despite the delays and array of technical problems, the weapons giant has continued to rack up generous contracts related to F-35 procurement and production. For example, in July, the US Navy ordered a $490 million package of equipment from Lockheed “to procure various material mod kits, special test/tooling equipment, as well as…product engineering” for already delivered, but defective planes. In August, Lockheed received another $606 million “fixed-price incentive (firm-target) undefinitized” contract “for long lead time materials, parts, components, and efforts to support of maintaining on-time production and delivery of 173 Lot 19 F-35 Joint Strike Fighter aircraft for Foreign Military Sales (FMS) customers and non-US Department of Defense (DOD) participants.”The terms of the contracts seem to be the culprit behind the F-35’s soaring costs (and Lockheed’s soaring profits, despite delivery of defective products), with so-called “cost-plus” and “undefinitized” contracts effectively making any overruns the buyer’s problem – i.e. that of US taxpayers, and of citizens of any country unfortunate enough to pen contracts for the planes from Lockheed.What About America’s Competitors?The worst part about the F-35’s troublesome history seems to be that the F-35 has already become ""obsolete"" in the sense that many of the US and NATO’s competitors have obtained the ability to defeat them, with Russia and China gaining capabilities to track and target the jets going back to the mid-to-late 2010s. In April, Iran announced that its engineers had created advanced radar technologies to not only detect F-35s, but identify the radar signature of individual F-35 planes, enabling the Islamic Republic to plan defensive operations accordingly.",WORLD,AMERICAS,Picture description not found,Author details not found,Author details not found,60,1305,<FreqDist with 18 samples and 775 outcomes>
Toxic explosion in Nebraska shows US unable to take issues affecting public security seriously: experts,Xu Yelu,2023-09-15,"Barely two months after an explosion in Louisiana, a train carrying toxic perchloric acid has exploded in a Nebraska rail yard on Thursday, prompting evacuation orders to be issued, as huge plumes are seen engulfing the city. Experts said the incident shows the US has been unable to take seriously and overcome major issues affecting public safety and the environment and ecology in the country.The incident happened on Union Pacific Railroad tracks in the city of North Platte. North Platte Volunteer Fire Department announced that they would order those living in the area to evacuate due to the toxic smoke from the railroad, according to media reports.In a post on social media platforms, it said that ""Emergency evacuation for the area between splinter and front North of railroad track due fire at the railroad involving heavy toxic smoke.""In a statement to DailyMail.com, Union Pacific Railroad said that an explosion occurred inside a container which resulted in several railcars catching fire. The railcar did not derail, the company said, and had been in the yard for several hours.Union Pacific said that one of the containers contained a hazardous chemical called perchloric acid, according to Daily Mail.Perchloric is a hazardous material used in food, drugs and biocidal products, as well as explosives, according to the report.Two months ago, a fire at a Louisiana chemical plant triggered explosions that shook homes several miles away and sent flames and smoke billowing into the air in mid-July, prompting emergency officials to urge a few hundred nearby residents to shelter indoors for several hours and to turn off their air conditioners, the Associated Press reported.Antiquated infrastructure and the outdated transportation were one factor. Another was a flawed system of governance in the US transport industry, experts noted. There is no doubt that the US has serious loopholes in the transportation management of hazardous substances, and the relevant error correction mechanism is in fact not effective, which means that this kind of thing will occur in the future, Li Haidong, a professor at the China Foreign Affairs University, told the Global Times on Friday.This shows that the US has been unable to take seriously and overcome serious and major issues affecting public safety and the environment and ecology in the country, Li said. ""It must be said that this is a great irony to the self-proclaimed internal governance of the most advanced country in the world.""Analysts said that the frequent occurrence of similar incidents shows that the error correction mechanism in the US has failed. Apart from this, racism and the proliferation of guns are also clear examples of the failure of error correction mechanisms, experts noted.",WORLD,AMERICAS,"A resident of East Palestine in the state of Ohio, US, angrily points during a town hall meeting held by the US

Greek scholar believes in ‘endless possibilities and vast land’ between China-Greece exchanges,Xu Liuliu,2023-09-14,"Chongqing, Sichuan, Shandong… Stelios Virvidakis expectantly plans his next China tour before a visit by the Global Times at his office in Athens, Greece. The University of Athens professor has grown far busier recently since he and four other Greek scholars launched the Center of Chinese and Greek Ancient Civilizations in February. Over the summer, the center has received two scholars from China who have given lectures on the history of China, and other visiting guests from places like Israel, who offered their views on Chinese medicine and its history, and a lecturer from France with insights in Chinese mathematics and how scholars in ancient China studied the living science.""Students found them to be very interesting and greatly appreciated the lectures,"" Virvidakis told the Global Times. ""Greece and China share so many similarities. So in my opinion, the horizon for our cooperation and exchanges is vast. There are endless possibilities which have not been explored.""Mutual learning Chinese President Xi Jinping replied to a letter from Virvidakis and four other Greek scholars earlier in 2023, extending congratulations over the founding of the Center of Chinese and Greek Ancient Civilizations.Hailing the long history of the Chinese civilization and profound influence of the ancient Greek civilization, Xi said in the letter that more than 2,000 years ago, the two civilizations shone brightly on the two ends of the Eurasian continent, jointly making a fundamental contribution to the evolution of human civilization.Greece's golden era produced many of its great philosophers and literary giants. The era coincided with a period in China in which ""a hundred schools of thought contended with each other"" and flourished together.As early as the 4th century BC, China was known to the Greeks by a beautiful name: Sērikḗ. In the 16th century, Euclid's Elements was introduced into China, paving the way for scientific exchanges between China and the West. The story of Prometheus narrated by Aeschylus was an inspiration to many Chinese revolutionaries. The Republic by Plato and Politics by Aristotle are also among the Greek classics known to have long made a name for themselves in China.In the eyes of Virvidakis, Chinese civilization has always been a culture that attracts people though the language is difficult. However, Chinese art, Chinese painting, Chinese poetry, especially love poems, even detective stories about China, are incredibly fascinating. Chinese director Zhang Yimou, and movies like Farewell My Concubine and Raise the Red Lantern starring Gong Li, are also very popular. Greek archaeologists who are interested in Chinese archeology want to know how China explores the past.In other art forms, the mythology and theater, ""we have tragedy, which is our own tradition. You have Chinese opera with music."" Actors and artists always want to study similarities and look at the differences, which is also the commitment of the center to promoting exchanges and mutual learning between the two civilizations and promoting the development of civilizations in various countries. China also has this appeal because people in the West think ""it's very different, it's exotic, something strange, but then they realize that it's beautiful for them."" So ""they find a lot of aspects that they have not thought about before in order to understand.""

Tiantan, a UNESCO World Heritage Site built in 1420, in Beijing Photo: VCGPhilosophy, a way of life There is a feeling among some people in the West that the Chinese system is different in some ways, said the professor. For instance,the European and American systems place great emphasis on individual rights, but China takes a more holistic approach in which ""harmony, social harmony is more important in sovereign.""""We are not exactly the same and there are also differences. But I don't believe in the so-called clash of civilizations theory that the clash is very deep and we can't live together with our differences,"" he told the Global Times. ""In fact we can live together and have peaceful exchanges. As I said, I don't think there is any danger of Greece threatening China or China occupying Greece.""In February, Virvidakis held a lecture at the center's launching ceremony, titled Philosophy is a Way of Life. Philosophy is not just theory, he said, noting that in ancient Greece and China it didn't mean just making theories about the universe, nature, god, or much of the unknown world. ""It told you how to 'organize' your life to feel happy and achieve harmony with others."" Western philosophy cannot be understood just by itself as there are also Chinese and Indian schools of philosophy among others. ""It is easier to see some similarities in ideas between Confucius and Socrates or Confucius and Aristotle,"" said Virvidakis, explaining why he is so fond of Chinese philosophy, especially Confucius thought. A simple question about what is a good life has a variety of answers in different philosophical theories.  But studying philosophy is practical and a way of life. Modern people don't just derive happiness from materialism. They need art and other emotionally stirring elements in life. In different parts and different cultures of the world,people can share similarities in emotion and sentiment.Virvidakis said that one of the most important reasons for his involving in such studies and exchanges was because ""I'm interested and I want to learn more. I'm a student too. When you are a teacher in your whole life, you're going to be a student.""",ARTS,CULTURE & LEISURE,The University of Athens Photo: VCG,"Reporter, Beijing","Global Times senior reporter, mainly covers the reporting of movies, TV, music and culture news.",43,880,<FreqDist with 16 samples and 473 outcomes>

 The first Saudi ambassador to Palestine Naif bin Bandar Al-Sudairi arrived in the West Bank on Tuesday, the official Palestinian news agency WAFA reported.Leading an official delegation, Al-Sudairi, the non-resident ambassador to Palestine and non-resident consul general in Jerusalem, presented his credentials to Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas at the presidency headquarters in Ramallah, it said.Al-Sudairi's arrival comes amid Israel's efforts to normalize relations with Saudi Arabia.During their meeting, Abbas welcomed Al-Sudairi and said his visit to Palestine and his appointment as Saudi ambassador to the State of Palestine would contribute to ""strengthening the strong fraternal relations that bind the two countries and the two brotherly peoples.""The Saudi ambassador said he hoped that his visit would be ""a successful beginning for strengthening relations in all fields,"" stressing his country's firm and supportive positions for the Palestinian people and their just cause.Earlier in the day, Al-Sudairi told reporters in a statement that ""the Arab Peace Initiative is the basic point in any upcoming agreement,"" after being asked about the fate of the initiative in the event of reaching a normalization deal between Saudi Arabia and Israel.The Arab Peace Initiative was launched in 2002 after it was drafted by Saudi Arabia and adopted by the Arab League.The initiative calls for an end to the conflict between Israel and Palestine and the normalization of relations between Israel and Arab states, in exchange for an Israeli withdrawal from the areas it gained since 1967 and proper settlement to the issue of Palestinian refugees.The Palestinians demanded the establishment of an independent state alongside Israel in all of the Palestinian territories occupied by Israel in 1967, including the entire West Bank and the Gaza Strip, with East Jerusalem as its capital.The Saudi ambassador also confirmed that his country intends to open a consulate in East Jerusalem soon.",PHOTO,WORLD,"Saudi ambassador to Palestine Naif bin Bandar Al-Sudairi (Front) arrives at the Palestinian foreign ministry headquarters in the West Bank city of Ramallah, on Sept. 26, 2023.(Photo: Xinhua)",Author details not found,Author details not found,12,313,<FreqDist with 15 samples and 181 outcomes>
China releases a white paper on its proposals and actions on building a global community of shared future,GT staff reporters,2023-09-26," The Chinese government released a white paper on Tuesday to introduce the theoretical base, practice and development of a global community of shared future, as by presenting China's vision of the course of human development, it counters the hegemonic thinking of certain countries that seek supremacy. The white paper, titled ""A Global Community of Shared Future: China's Proposals and Actions,"" introduced the background for China to raise the concept of a global community of shared future as the world is undergoing changes on a scale unseen in a century with various problems posing unprecedented challenges for human society. The zero-sum game is doomed to fail, the white paper said. But certain countries still cling to this mindset, blindly pursuing absolute security and monopolistic advantages, which will do nothing for their development in the long run but create a major threat to the world. It is increasingly obvious that the obsession with superior strength, and the zero-sum mentality are in conflict with the needs of our times, the white paper said, pointing out that the new era calls for new ideas. To build a global community of shared future is to pursue openness, inclusiveness, mutual benefit, equity and justice, the white paper said. The goal is not to replace one system or civilization with another. Instead, it is about countries with different social systems, ideologies, histories, shared rights, and shared responsibilities in global affairs. The vision of a global community of shared future stands on the right side of history and on the side of human progress. It introduces a new approach for international relations, provides new ideas for global governance, opens up new prospects for international exchanges and draws a new blueprint for a better world, according to the white paper. Such important vision transcends outdated mindsets such as zero-sum game, power politics, and Cold War confrontations. It has become the overall goal of China's major-country diplomacy in the new era, and a great banner that leads the trend of the times and the direction of human progress. The concept of a global community of shared future has deep roots in China's profound cultural heritage and its unique experience of modernization. It carries forward the diplomatic traditions of China and draws on the outstanding achievements of all other civilizations, the white paper said. It also manifests China's time-honored historical traditions, distinct characteristics of the times, and a wealth of humanistic values.  The white paper also pointed out the direction and plan to build a global community of shared future including pressing ahead with a new type of economic globalization in which countries need to pursue a policy of openness and explicitly oppose protectionism, the erection of fences and barriers, unilateral sanctions, and maximum-pressure tactics, so as to connect economies and jointly build an open world economy. Some countries are seeking to decouple from China, enclosing themselves in ""small yards, high fences,"" which will ultimately only backfire, the white paper said. Also, some people overstate the need to ""reduce dependence"" and ""de-risk,"" which is essentially creating new risks. The direction and the plan also include following a peaceful development plan, fostering a new type of international relations, practicing true multilateralism and promoting the common values of humanity. Over the past decade, China has contributed its strength to building a global community of shared future with firm conviction and solid actions. For instance, by July 2023, more than three-quarters of countries in the world and over 30 international organizations had signed agreements on Belt and Road cooperation with China. The BRI originated in China but the opportunities and achievements it creates belong to the whole world. It's an initiative for economic cooperation, not for geopolitical or military alliances, and it's open and inclusive process that neither targets nor excludes any party, the white paper said. Among those BRI projects, for example, the China-Laos Railway began operation on December 3, 2021, with 167 tunnels and 301 bridges built in 11 years along its total length of 1,035 kilometers. The railway construction created more than 110,000 local jobs, and helped build about 2,000 kilometers of roads and canals for villages along the railway, benefiting local people. Besides the BRI, the Global Development Initiative, the Global Security Initiative and Global Civilization Initiative have evolved into a crucial cornerstone for building a global community of shared future, offering China's solutions to major challenges pertaining to peace and development for humanity. Facing constant flare-ups of hotspot issues, China has been committed to fulfilling its role as a responsible major country, pushing for the resolution of international and regional flashpoints, such as the Korean Peninsula, Palestine, the Iranian nuclear issue, Syria and Afghanistan, the white paper said. On the Ukraine issue, China has actively promoted talks for peace, put forth four points, four things that the international community should do together and three observations, and released China's position on the political settlement of the Ukraine crisis and has dispatched the special representative of the Chinese government on Eurasian affairs to engage in extensive interactions and exchanges with stakeholders on the political settlement of the Ukraine crisis. Also, through the mediation of China, Saudi Arabia and Iran achieve historic reconciliation earlier this year, setting a fine example for countries in the region to resolve disputes and differences and achieve good neighborly relations through dialogue and consultation, and catalyzing a wave of reconciliation in the Middle East. China has also proposed a range of regional and bilateral initiatives on building communities of shared future and working with stakeholders to build consensus and expand cooperation, there by playing a constructive role in promoting regional peace and development. It also boosts international cooperation in fields including fighting the COVID-19 pandemic, addressing disorder in cyberspace governance and dealing with the global climate challenge. Over the past decade, the vision of a global community of shared future has gained broader support. More countries and people have come to the understanding that this vision serves the common interests of humanity, represents popular calls for peace, justice and progress, and can create the greatest synergy among all nations for building a better world, the white paper said.",CHINA,POLITICS,Photo: Li Xuanmin/GT,Author details not found,Author details not found,33,1000,<FreqDist with 17 samples and 603 outcomes>

F-35: Closer Look at Colossally Costly Jet That Just Can’t Seem to Stay Airborne,Sputnik,2023-09-21,"A US Marine Corps F-35B went down over South Carolina on Sunday after its pilot ejected mid-flight for reasons unknown. Why do F-35s seem so crash-prone? What’s wrong with them? And what role does the waste and fraud in the US military-industrial complex play in creating such a Frankenstein’s monster of an aircraft? Sputnik explores.Debris from the F-35B that went missing over South Carolina on September 17 was found in Williamsburg County, South Carolina, about two hours northeast of Joint Base Charleston on Monday following more than a day of frantic searching by the military. An as yet unspecified “mishap” was blamed for the accident. The pilot escaped unscathed.“The mishap is currently under investigation, and we are unable to provide additional details to preserve the integrity of the investigative process,” the Marine Corps said in a statement Monday. The Marines ordered a two-day global pause in all aerial operations, with the errant F-35B becoming the third major aviation-related accident suffered by the military branch in less than two months.Air units will be discussing “fundamentals of safe flight operations, ground safety, maintenance and flight procedures, and maintaining combat readiness,” the Marine Corps said.How Many F-35s Have Been Lost?Since it started being introduced into service with the Marines (2015), the US Air Force (2016), and the US Navy (2019) and began to be exported to foreign clients (starting with Israel in 2018), the F-35 has gained an unenviable reputation of being a costly, buggy, and crash-prone jet, with the F-35B that went down over South Carolina last week being at least the 11th Lightning II lost since 2018.On September 28, 2018, a US Marine Corps F-35B crashed during a flight near Marine Corps Air Station Beaufort in South Carolina, with a faulty fuel tube blamed for the incident. The pilot emerged unscathed.On April 9, 2019, a Japanese Self- Defense Force F-35A went down off Honshu, Japan. The pilot was killed after losing his bearings and suffering “special disorientation” mid-flight over the ocean.On May 19, 2020, a US Air Force F-35A from the 58th Fighter Squadron crashed while performing a landing at Eglin Air Force Base in western Florida. Pilot error (trying to land at excessive speed) and a mechanical defect related to a flight control glitch that left the plane’s tail unresponsive were blamed. The pilot survived.On September 29, 2020, a US Marine Corps F-35B was lost over Imperial County, California after colliding with a KC-130 tanker during midflight refueling. The tanker crew managed to bring their aircraft down for a hard landing. The F-35 pilot ejected successfully.On November 17, 2021, a British Royal Air Force F-35B plunged into the Mediterranean Sea after its pilot ejected during routine operations. That crash was ultimately blamed on a protective cover getting wedged into the plane’s engine intake.On January 4, 2022, a South Korean Air Force F-35A suffering from issues with its onboard avionics carried out an emergency belly landing. Investigators blamed a bird striking the warplane’s landing gear mid-flight. The pilot emerged unharmed.On January 24, 2022, a US Navy F-35C plunged into the South China Sea after making a hard landing on the USS Carl Vinson super carrier. The pilot and six sailors on the deck of the aircraft carrier were injured. A Navy investigation attributed the incident to pilot error.On October 19, 2022, another F-35, this one from the US Air Force, crashed at Hill Air Force Base in Utah during a training mission. The pilot ejected safely. It was later determined that turbulent air somehow confused the jet’s onboard avionics to the point where the aircraft became uncontrollable.On December 1, 2022, a Marine Corps F-35B collapsed on a military base in Japan after suffering a landing gear failure during training. No one was injured.Finally, on December 15, 2022, a US Navy F-35B crashed while attempting to perform a vertical landing at Naval Air Station Joint Reserve Base Fort Worth in Texas during testing of the jet’s systems. A “harmonic resonance” issue related to the jet’s Pratt & Whitney F135 engine was blamed, with the Pentagon halting further F-35 deliveries by Lockheed until an investigation was concluded.What’s Wrong With the F-35?Nearly 17 years after the F-35’s first flight, and eight years after its adoption into service, the F-35 continues to maintain a troublingly long list of technical bugs affecting both hardware and software. The aircraft, which has an astronomical total estimated purchase and sustainment price tag of over $1.7 trillion, and a per-plane cost of $70-$90 million, has faced years of harsh criticism from US officials, including former President Donald Trump at one point, who said the jet’s costs had spiraled “out of control.”At its heart, the F-35 is the product of an idea that metastasized in the Pentagon after the end of the Cold War, envisioning an all-in-one fighter platform which could be used by every branch of the military, equipped with vertical take-off and landing capability, and carry out a broad array of missions using a variety of onboard weapons. The do-it-all jet was supposed to replace nearly all of America’s fourth-gen fighter, strike, and ground attack aircraft, including the F-16 Falcon, the F/A-18 Hornet and Super Hornet, the AV-8B Harrier II, and others.The jet features just a single onboard engine – the aforementioned Pratt & Whitney F135, with engine-related troubles not only regularly referred to by watchdogs as a “leading driver” of the F-35’s problems remaining “mission capable,” but also making its operation over enemy territory or over the sea risky, since if something goes wrong, the plane doesn’t have a backup engine to limp home with.Throughout its production cycle, the F-35 Lightning II has suffered a dizzying and seemingly endless list of technical problems, from neck-snapping ejection seats to problems, ironically, while operating in stormy weather.In its 2023 report, the congressional Government Accountability Office revealed that the F-35 program “continues to experience schedule delays, cost growth, and late deliveries,” with procurement costs jumping by $13.4 billion since 2019, and modernization behind schedule and over budget.“As of January 2023, of the 821 open deficiencies, the program office characterized five of these as category 1 [i.e. critical issues which could jeopardize flight safety and security], and 816 as category 2, [i.e. those which could impede or constrain mission success].”In all, between December 2006 and 2023, the GAO has reported a whopping 277 category 1 and 2,467 category 2 deficiencies with the aircraft, among them serious issues like cabin over-pressurization, problems with the jets’ night vision systems, software bugs, radar issues, corrosion, ejection seats which could snap pilots’ necks, etc.Is a Culture of Largess to Blame?Sunday’s accident in South Carolina is the latest piece of F-35-related bad news for Lockheed Martin. In June, it was reported that the Pentagon had halted the delivery of any additional upgraded F-35s until major issues related to new Technology Refresh 3 (TR-3) hardware and weapons-related software were resolved. DoD F-35 program director Mike Schmidt told Congress in March that the risk assessment related to the TR-3 hardware upgrade wouldn’t be finished until April 2024.Despite the delays and array of technical problems, the weapons giant has continued to rack up generous contracts related to F-35 procurement and production. For example, in July, the US Navy ordered a $490 million package of equipment from Lockheed “to procure various material mod kits, special test/tooling equipment, as well as…product engineering” for already delivered, but defective planes. In August, Lockheed received another $606 million “fixed-price incentive (firm-target) undefinitized” contract “for long lead time materials, parts, components, and efforts to support of maintaining on-time production and delivery of 173 Lot 19 F-35 Joint Strike Fighter aircraft for Foreign Military Sales (FMS) customers and non-US Department of Defense (DOD) participants.”The terms of the contracts seem to be the culprit behind the F-35’s soaring costs (and Lockheed’s soaring profits, despite delivery of defective products), with so-called “cost-plus” and “undefinitized” contracts effectively making any overruns the buyer’s problem – i.e. that of US taxpayers, and of citizens of any country unfortunate enough to pen contracts for the planes from Lockheed.What About America’s Competitors?The worst part about the F-35’s troublesome history seems to be that the F-35 has already become ""obsolete"" in the sense that many of the US and NATO’s competitors have obtained the ability to defeat them, with Russia and China gaining capabilities to track and target the jets going back to the mid-to-late 2010s. In April, Iran announced that its engineers had created advanced radar technologies to not only detect F-35s, but identify the radar signature of individual F-35 planes, enabling the Islamic Republic to plan defensive operations accordingly.",WORLD,AMERICAS,Picture description not found,Author details not found,Author details not found,60,1305,<FreqDist with 18 samples and 775 outcomes>
Toxic explosion in Nebraska shows US unable to take issues affecting public security seriously: experts,Xu Yelu,2023-09-15,"Barely two months after an explosion in Louisiana, a train carrying toxic perchloric acid has exploded in a Nebraska rail yard on Thursday, prompting evacuation orders to be issued, as huge plumes are seen engulfing the city. Experts said the incident shows the US has been unable to take seriously and overcome major issues affecting public safety and the environment and ecology in the country.The incident happened on Union Pacific Railroad tracks in the city of North Platte. North Platte Volunteer Fire Department announced that they would order those living in the area to evacuate due to the toxic smoke from the railroad, according to media reports.In a post on social media platforms, it said that ""Emergency evacuation for the area between splinter and front North of railroad track due fire at the railroad involving heavy toxic smoke.""In a statement to DailyMail.com, Union Pacific Railroad said that an explosion occurred inside a container which resulted in several railcars catching fire. The railcar did not derail, the company said, and had been in the yard for several hours.Union Pacific said that one of the containers contained a hazardous chemical called perchloric acid, according to Daily Mail.Perchloric is a hazardous material used in food, drugs and biocidal products, as well as explosives, according to the report.Two months ago, a fire at a Louisiana chemical plant triggered explosions that shook homes several miles away and sent flames and smoke billowing into the air in mid-July, prompting emergency officials to urge a few hundred nearby residents to shelter indoors for several hours and to turn off their air conditioners, the Associated Press reported.Antiquated infrastructure and the outdated transportation were one factor. Another was a flawed system of governance in the US transport industry, experts noted. There is no doubt that the US has serious loopholes in the transportation management of hazardous substances, and the relevant error correction mechanism is in fact not effective, which means that this kind of thing will occur in the future, Li Haidong, a professor at the China Foreign Affairs University, told the Global Times on Friday.This shows that the US has been unable to take seriously and overcome serious and major issues affecting public safety and the environment and ecology in the country, Li said. ""It must be said that this is a great irony to the self-proclaimed internal governance of the most advanced country in the world.""Analysts said that the frequent occurrence of similar incidents shows that the error correction mechanism in the US has failed. Apart from this, racism and the proliferation of guns are also clear examples of the failure of error correction mechanisms, experts noted.",WORLD,AMERICAS,"A resident of East Palestine in the state of Ohio, US, angrily points during a town hall meeting held by the US

Greek scholar believes in ‘endless possibilities and vast land’ between China-Greece exchanges,Xu Liuliu,2023-09-14,"Chongqing, Sichuan, Shandong… Stelios Virvidakis expectantly plans his next China tour before a visit by the Global Times at his office in Athens, Greece. The University of Athens professor has grown far busier recently since he and four other Greek scholars launched the Center of Chinese and Greek Ancient Civilizations in February. Over the summer, the center has received two scholars from China who have given lectures on the history of China, and other visiting guests from places like Israel, who offered their views on Chinese medicine and its history, and a lecturer from France with insights in Chinese mathematics and how scholars in ancient China studied the living science.""Students found them to be very interesting and greatly appreciated the lectures,"" Virvidakis told the Global Times. ""Greece and China share so many similarities. So in my opinion, the horizon for our cooperation and exchanges is vast. There are endless possibilities which have not been explored.""Mutual learning Chinese President Xi Jinping replied to a letter from Virvidakis and four other Greek scholars earlier in 2023, extending congratulations over the founding of the Center of Chinese and Greek Ancient Civilizations.Hailing the long history of the Chinese civilization and profound influence of the ancient Greek civilization, Xi said in the letter that more than 2,000 years ago, the two civilizations shone brightly on the two ends of the Eurasian continent, jointly making a fundamental contribution to the evolution of human civilization.Greece's golden era produced many of its great philosophers and literary giants. The era coincided with a period in China in which ""a hundred schools of thought contended with each other"" and flourished together.As early as the 4th century BC, China was known to the Greeks by a beautiful name: Sērikḗ. In the 16th century, Euclid's Elements was introduced into China, paving the way for scientific exchanges between China and the West. The story of Prometheus narrated by Aeschylus was an inspiration to many Chinese revolutionaries. The Republic by Plato and Politics by Aristotle are also among the Greek classics known to have long made a name for themselves in China.In the eyes of Virvidakis, Chinese civilization has always been a culture that attracts people though the language is difficult. However, Chinese art, Chinese painting, Chinese poetry, especially love poems, even detective stories about China, are incredibly fascinating. Chinese director Zhang Yimou, and movies like Farewell My Concubine and Raise the Red Lantern starring Gong Li, are also very popular. Greek archaeologists who are interested in Chinese archeology want to know how China explores the past.In other art forms, the mythology and theater, ""we have tragedy, which is our own tradition. You have Chinese opera with music."" Actors and artists always want to study similarities and look at the differences, which is also the commitment of the center to promoting exchanges and mutual learning between the two civilizations and promoting the development of civilizations in various countries. China also has this appeal because people in the West think ""it's very different, it's exotic, something strange, but then they realize that it's beautiful for them."" So ""they find a lot of aspects that they have not thought about before in order to understand.""

Tiantan, a UNESCO World Heritage Site built in 1420, in Beijing Photo: VCGPhilosophy, a way of life There is a feeling among some people in the West that the Chinese system is different in some ways, said the professor. For instance,the European and American systems place great emphasis on individual rights, but China takes a more holistic approach in which ""harmony, social harmony is more important in sovereign.""""We are not exactly the same and there are also differences. But I don't believe in the so-called clash of civilizations theory that the clash is very deep and we can't live together with our differences,"" he told the Global Times. ""In fact we can live together and have peaceful exchanges. As I said, I don't think there is any danger of Greece threatening China or China occupying Greece.""In February, Virvidakis held a lecture at the center's launching ceremony, titled Philosophy is a Way of Life. Philosophy is not just theory, he said, noting that in ancient Greece and China it didn't mean just making theories about the universe, nature, god, or much of the unknown world. ""It told you how to 'organize' your life to feel happy and achieve harmony with others."" Western philosophy cannot be understood just by itself as there are also Chinese and Indian schools of philosophy among others. ""It is easier to see some similarities in ideas between Confucius and Socrates or Confucius and Aristotle,"" said Virvidakis, explaining why he is so fond of Chinese philosophy, especially Confucius thought. A simple question about what is a good life has a variety of answers in different philosophical theories.  But studying philosophy is practical and a way of life. Modern people don't just derive happiness from materialism. They need art and other emotionally stirring elements in life. In different parts and different cultures of the world,people can share similarities in emotion and sentiment.Virvidakis said that one of the most important reasons for his involving in such studies and exchanges was because ""I'm interested and I want to learn more. I'm a student too. When you are a teacher in your whole life, you're going to be a student.""",ARTS,CULTURE & LEISURE,The University of Athens Photo: VCG,"Reporter, Beijing","Global Times senior reporter, mainly covers the reporting of movies, TV, music and culture news.",43,880,<FreqDist with 16 samples and 473 outcomes>

 The first Saudi ambassador to Palestine Naif bin Bandar Al-Sudairi arrived in the West Bank on Tuesday, the official Palestinian news agency WAFA reported.Leading an official delegation, Al-Sudairi, the non-resident ambassador to Palestine and non-resident consul general in Jerusalem, presented his credentials to Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas at the presidency headquarters in Ramallah, it said.Al-Sudairi's arrival comes amid Israel's efforts to normalize relations with Saudi Arabia.During their meeting, Abbas welcomed Al-Sudairi and said his visit to Palestine and his appointment as Saudi ambassador to the State of Palestine would contribute to ""strengthening the strong fraternal relations that bind the two countries and the two brotherly peoples.""The Saudi ambassador said he hoped that his visit would be ""a successful beginning for strengthening relations in all fields,"" stressing his country's firm and supportive positions for the Palestinian people and their just cause.Earlier in the day, Al-Sudairi told reporters in a statement that ""the Arab Peace Initiative is the basic point in any upcoming agreement,"" after being asked about the fate of the initiative in the event of reaching a normalization deal between Saudi Arabia and Israel.The Arab Peace Initiative was launched in 2002 after it was drafted by Saudi Arabia and adopted by the Arab League.The initiative calls for an end to the conflict between Israel and Palestine and the normalization of relations between Israel and Arab states, in exchange for an Israeli withdrawal from the areas it gained since 1967 and proper settlement to the issue of Palestinian refugees.The Palestinians demanded the establishment of an independent state alongside Israel in all of the Palestinian territories occupied by Israel in 1967, including the entire West Bank and the Gaza Strip, with East Jerusalem as its capital.The Saudi ambassador also confirmed that his country intends to open a consulate in East Jerusalem soon.",PHOTO,WORLD,"Saudi ambassador to Palestine Naif bin Bandar Al-Sudairi (Front) arrives at the Palestinian foreign ministry headquarters in the West Bank city of Ramallah, on Sept. 26, 2023.(Photo: Xinhua)",Author details not found,Author details not found,12,313,<FreqDist with 15 samples and 181 outcomes>
China releases a white paper on its proposals and actions on building a global community of shared future,GT staff reporters,2023-09-26," The Chinese government released a white paper on Tuesday to introduce the theoretical base, practice and development of a global community of shared future, as by presenting China's vision of the course of human development, it counters the hegemonic thinking of certain countries that seek supremacy. The white paper, titled ""A Global Community of Shared Future: China's Proposals and Actions,"" introduced the background for China to raise the concept of a global community of shared future as the world is undergoing changes on a scale unseen in a century with various problems posing unprecedented challenges for human society. The zero-sum game is doomed to fail, the white paper said. But certain countries still cling to this mindset, blindly pursuing absolute security and monopolistic advantages, which will do nothing for their development in the long run but create a major threat to the world. It is increasingly obvious that the obsession with superior strength, and the zero-sum mentality are in conflict with the needs of our times, the white paper said, pointing out that the new era calls for new ideas. To build a global community of shared future is to pursue openness, inclusiveness, mutual benefit, equity and justice, the white paper said. The goal is not to replace one system or civilization with another. Instead, it is about countries with different social systems, ideologies, histories, shared rights, and shared responsibilities in global affairs. The vision of a global community of shared future stands on the right side of history and on the side of human progress. It introduces a new approach for international relations, provides new ideas for global governance, opens up new prospects for international exchanges and draws a new blueprint for a better world, according to the white paper. Such important vision transcends outdated mindsets such as zero-sum game, power politics, and Cold War confrontations. It has become the overall goal of China's major-country diplomacy in the new era, and a great banner that leads the trend of the times and the direction of human progress. The concept of a global community of shared future has deep roots in China's profound cultural heritage and its unique experience of modernization. It carries forward the diplomatic traditions of China and draws on the outstanding achievements of all other civilizations, the white paper said. It also manifests China's time-honored historical traditions, distinct characteristics of the times, and a wealth of humanistic values.  The white paper also pointed out the direction and plan to build a global community of shared future including pressing ahead with a new type of economic globalization in which countries need to pursue a policy of openness and explicitly oppose protectionism, the erection of fences and barriers, unilateral sanctions, and maximum-pressure tactics, so as to connect economies and jointly build an open world economy. Some countries are seeking to decouple from China, enclosing themselves in ""small yards, high fences,"" which will ultimately only backfire, the white paper said. Also, some people overstate the need to ""reduce dependence"" and ""de-risk,"" which is essentially creating new risks. The direction and the plan also include following a peaceful development plan, fostering a new type of international relations, practicing true multilateralism and promoting the common values of humanity. Over the past decade, China has contributed its strength to building a global community of shared future with firm conviction and solid actions. For instance, by July 2023, more than three-quarters of countries in the world and over 30 international organizations had signed agreements on Belt and Road cooperation with China. The BRI originated in China but the opportunities and achievements it creates belong to the whole world. It's an initiative for economic cooperation, not for geopolitical or military alliances, and it's open and inclusive process that neither targets nor excludes any party, the white paper said. Among those BRI projects, for example, the China-Laos Railway began operation on December 3, 2021, with 167 tunnels and 301 bridges built in 11 years along its total length of 1,035 kilometers. The railway construction created more than 110,000 local jobs, and helped build about 2,000 kilometers of roads and canals for villages along the railway, benefiting local people. Besides the BRI, the Global Development Initiative, the Global Security Initiative and Global Civilization Initiative have evolved into a crucial cornerstone for building a global community of shared future, offering China's solutions to major challenges pertaining to peace and development for humanity. Facing constant flare-ups of hotspot issues, China has been committed to fulfilling its role as a responsible major country, pushing for the resolution of international and regional flashpoints, such as the Korean Peninsula, Palestine, the Iranian nuclear issue, Syria and Afghanistan, the white paper said. On the Ukraine issue, China has actively promoted talks for peace, put forth four points, four things that the international community should do together and three observations, and released China's position on the political settlement of the Ukraine crisis and has dispatched the special representative of the Chinese government on Eurasian affairs to engage in extensive interactions and exchanges with stakeholders on the political settlement of the Ukraine crisis. Also, through the mediation of China, Saudi Arabia and Iran achieve historic reconciliation earlier this year, setting a fine example for countries in the region to resolve disputes and differences and achieve good neighborly relations through dialogue and consultation, and catalyzing a wave of reconciliation in the Middle East. China has also proposed a range of regional and bilateral initiatives on building communities of shared future and working with stakeholders to build consensus and expand cooperation, there by playing a constructive role in promoting regional peace and development. It also boosts international cooperation in fields including fighting the COVID-19 pandemic, addressing disorder in cyberspace governance and dealing with the global climate challenge. Over the past decade, the vision of a global community of shared future has gained broader support. More countries and people have come to the understanding that this vision serves the common interests of humanity, represents popular calls for peace, justice and progress, and can create the greatest synergy among all nations for building a better world, the white paper said.",CHINA,POLITICS,Photo: Li Xuanmin/GT,Author details not found,Author details not found,33,1000,<FreqDist with 17 samples and 603 outcomes>

F-35: Closer Look at Colossally Costly Jet That Just Can’t Seem to Stay Airborne,Sputnik,2023-09-21,"A US Marine Corps F-35B went down over South Carolina on Sunday after its pilot ejected mid-flight for reasons unknown. Why do F-35s seem so crash-prone? What’s wrong with them? And what role does the waste and fraud in the US military-industrial complex play in creating such a Frankenstein’s monster of an aircraft? Sputnik explores.Debris from the F-35B that went missing over South Carolina on September 17 was found in Williamsburg County, South Carolina, about two hours northeast of Joint Base Charleston on Monday following more than a day of frantic searching by the military. An as yet unspecified “mishap” was blamed for the accident. The pilot escaped unscathed.“The mishap is currently under investigation, and we are unable to provide additional details to preserve the integrity of the investigative process,” the Marine Corps said in a statement Monday. The Marines ordered a two-day global pause in all aerial operations, with the errant F-35B becoming the third major aviation-related accident suffered by the military branch in less than two months.Air units will be discussing “fundamentals of safe flight operations, ground safety, maintenance and flight procedures, and maintaining combat readiness,” the Marine Corps said.How Many F-35s Have Been Lost?Since it started being introduced into service with the Marines (2015), the US Air Force (2016), and the US Navy (2019) and began to be exported to foreign clients (starting with Israel in 2018), the F-35 has gained an unenviable reputation of being a costly, buggy, and crash-prone jet, with the F-35B that went down over South Carolina last week being at least the 11th Lightning II lost since 2018.On September 28, 2018, a US Marine Corps F-35B crashed during a flight near Marine Corps Air Station Beaufort in South Carolina, with a faulty fuel tube blamed for the incident. The pilot emerged unscathed.On April 9, 2019, a Japanese Self- Defense Force F-35A went down off Honshu, Japan. The pilot was killed after losing his bearings and suffering “special disorientation” mid-flight over the ocean.On May 19, 2020, a US Air Force F-35A from the 58th Fighter Squadron crashed while performing a landing at Eglin Air Force Base in western Florida. Pilot error (trying to land at excessive speed) and a mechanical defect related to a flight control glitch that left the plane’s tail unresponsive were blamed. The pilot survived.On September 29, 2020, a US Marine Corps F-35B was lost over Imperial County, California after colliding with a KC-130 tanker during midflight refueling. The tanker crew managed to bring their aircraft down for a hard landing. The F-35 pilot ejected successfully.On November 17, 2021, a British Royal Air Force F-35B plunged into the Mediterranean Sea after its pilot ejected during routine operations. That crash was ultimately blamed on a protective cover getting wedged into the plane’s engine intake.On January 4, 2022, a South Korean Air Force F-35A suffering from issues with its onboard avionics carried out an emergency belly landing. Investigators blamed a bird striking the warplane’s landing gear mid-flight. The pilot emerged unharmed.On January 24, 2022, a US Navy F-35C plunged into the South China Sea after making a hard landing on the USS Carl Vinson super carrier. The pilot and six sailors on the deck of the aircraft carrier were injured. A Navy investigation attributed the incident to pilot error.On October 19, 2022, another F-35, this one from the US Air Force, crashed at Hill Air Force Base in Utah during a training mission. The pilot ejected safely. It was later determined that turbulent air somehow confused the jet’s onboard avionics to the point where the aircraft became uncontrollable.On December 1, 2022, a Marine Corps F-35B collapsed on a military base in Japan after suffering a landing gear failure during training. No one was injured.Finally, on December 15, 2022, a US Navy F-35B crashed while attempting to perform a vertical landing at Naval Air Station Joint Reserve Base Fort Worth in Texas during testing of the jet’s systems. A “harmonic resonance” issue related to the jet’s Pratt & Whitney F135 engine was blamed, with the Pentagon halting further F-35 deliveries by Lockheed until an investigation was concluded.What’s Wrong With the F-35?Nearly 17 years after the F-35’s first flight, and eight years after its adoption into service, the F-35 continues to maintain a troublingly long list of technical bugs affecting both hardware and software. The aircraft, which has an astronomical total estimated purchase and sustainment price tag of over $1.7 trillion, and a per-plane cost of $70-$90 million, has faced years of harsh criticism from US officials, including former President Donald Trump at one point, who said the jet’s costs had spiraled “out of control.”At its heart, the F-35 is the product of an idea that metastasized in the Pentagon after the end of the Cold War, envisioning an all-in-one fighter platform which could be used by every branch of the military, equipped with vertical take-off and landing capability, and carry out a broad array of missions using a variety of onboard weapons. The do-it-all jet was supposed to replace nearly all of America’s fourth-gen fighter, strike, and ground attack aircraft, including the F-16 Falcon, the F/A-18 Hornet and Super Hornet, the AV-8B Harrier II, and others.The jet features just a single onboard engine – the aforementioned Pratt & Whitney F135, with engine-related troubles not only regularly referred to by watchdogs as a “leading driver” of the F-35’s problems remaining “mission capable,” but also making its operation over enemy territory or over the sea risky, since if something goes wrong, the plane doesn’t have a backup engine to limp home with.Throughout its production cycle, the F-35 Lightning II has suffered a dizzying and seemingly endless list of technical problems, from neck-snapping ejection seats to problems, ironically, while operating in stormy weather.In its 2023 report, the congressional Government Accountability Office revealed that the F-35 program “continues to experience schedule delays, cost growth, and late deliveries,” with procurement costs jumping by $13.4 billion since 2019, and modernization behind schedule and over budget.“As of January 2023, of the 821 open deficiencies, the program office characterized five of these as category 1 [i.e. critical issues which could jeopardize flight safety and security], and 816 as category 2, [i.e. those which could impede or constrain mission success].”In all, between December 2006 and 2023, the GAO has reported a whopping 277 category 1 and 2,467 category 2 deficiencies with the aircraft, among them serious issues like cabin over-pressurization, problems with the jets’ night vision systems, software bugs, radar issues, corrosion, ejection seats which could snap pilots’ necks, etc.Is a Culture of Largess to Blame?Sunday’s accident in South Carolina is the latest piece of F-35-related bad news for Lockheed Martin. In June, it was reported that the Pentagon had halted the delivery of any additional upgraded F-35s until major issues related to new Technology Refresh 3 (TR-3) hardware and weapons-related software were resolved. DoD F-35 program director Mike Schmidt told Congress in March that the risk assessment related to the TR-3 hardware upgrade wouldn’t be finished until April 2024.Despite the delays and array of technical problems, the weapons giant has continued to rack up generous contracts related to F-35 procurement and production. For example, in July, the US Navy ordered a $490 million package of equipment from Lockheed “to procure various material mod kits, special test/tooling equipment, as well as…product engineering” for already delivered, but defective planes. In August, Lockheed received another $606 million “fixed-price incentive (firm-target) undefinitized” contract “for long lead time materials, parts, components, and efforts to support of maintaining on-time production and delivery of 173 Lot 19 F-35 Joint Strike Fighter aircraft for Foreign Military Sales (FMS) customers and non-US Department of Defense (DOD) participants.”The terms of the contracts seem to be the culprit behind the F-35’s soaring costs (and Lockheed’s soaring profits, despite delivery of defective products), with so-called “cost-plus” and “undefinitized” contracts effectively making any overruns the buyer’s problem – i.e. that of US taxpayers, and of citizens of any country unfortunate enough to pen contracts for the planes from Lockheed.What About America’s Competitors?The worst part about the F-35’s troublesome history seems to be that the F-35 has already become ""obsolete"" in the sense that many of the US and NATO’s competitors have obtained the ability to defeat them, with Russia and China gaining capabilities to track and target the jets going back to the mid-to-late 2010s. In April, Iran announced that its engineers had created advanced radar technologies to not only detect F-35s, but identify the radar signature of individual F-35 planes, enabling the Islamic Republic to plan defensive operations accordingly.",WORLD,AMERICAS,Picture description not found,Author details not found,Author details not found,60,1305,<FreqDist with 18 samples and 775 outcomes>
Toxic explosion in Nebraska shows US unable to take issues affecting public security seriously: experts,Xu Yelu,2023-09-15,"Barely two months after an explosion in Louisiana, a train carrying toxic perchloric acid has exploded in a Nebraska rail yard on Thursday, prompting evacuation orders to be issued, as huge plumes are seen engulfing the city. Experts said the incident shows the US has been unable to take seriously and overcome major issues affecting public safety and the environment and ecology in the country.The incident happened on Union Pacific Railroad tracks in the city of North Platte. North Platte Volunteer Fire Department announced that they would order those living in the area to evacuate due to the toxic smoke from the railroad, according to media reports.In a post on social media platforms, it said that ""Emergency evacuation for the area between splinter and front North of railroad track due fire at the railroad involving heavy toxic smoke.""In a statement to DailyMail.com, Union Pacific Railroad said that an explosion occurred inside a container which resulted in several railcars catching fire. The railcar did not derail, the company said, and had been in the yard for several hours.Union Pacific said that one of the containers contained a hazardous chemical called perchloric acid, according to Daily Mail.Perchloric is a hazardous material used in food, drugs and biocidal products, as well as explosives, according to the report.Two months ago, a fire at a Louisiana chemical plant triggered explosions that shook homes several miles away and sent flames and smoke billowing into the air in mid-July, prompting emergency officials to urge a few hundred nearby residents to shelter indoors for several hours and to turn off their air conditioners, the Associated Press reported.Antiquated infrastructure and the outdated transportation were one factor. Another was a flawed system of governance in the US transport industry, experts noted. There is no doubt that the US has serious loopholes in the transportation management of hazardous substances, and the relevant error correction mechanism is in fact not effective, which means that this kind of thing will occur in the future, Li Haidong, a professor at the China Foreign Affairs University, told the Global Times on Friday.This shows that the US has been unable to take seriously and overcome serious and major issues affecting public safety and the environment and ecology in the country, Li said. ""It must be said that this is a great irony to the self-proclaimed internal governance of the most advanced country in the world.""Analysts said that the frequent occurrence of similar incidents shows that the error correction mechanism in the US has failed. Apart from this, racism and the proliferation of guns are also clear examples of the failure of error correction mechanisms, experts noted.",WORLD,AMERICAS,"A resident of East Palestine in the state of Ohio, US, angrily points during a town hall meeting held by the US

Greek scholar believes in ‘endless possibilities and vast land’ between China-Greece exchanges,Xu Liuliu,2023-09-14,"Chongqing, Sichuan, Shandong… Stelios Virvidakis expectantly plans his next China tour before a visit by the Global Times at his office in Athens, Greece. The University of Athens professor has grown far busier recently since he and four other Greek scholars launched the Center of Chinese and Greek Ancient Civilizations in February. Over the summer, the center has received two scholars from China who have given lectures on the history of China, and other visiting guests from places like Israel, who offered their views on Chinese medicine and its history, and a lecturer from France with insights in Chinese mathematics and how scholars in ancient China studied the living science.""Students found them to be very interesting and greatly appreciated the lectures,"" Virvidakis told the Global Times. ""Greece and China share so many similarities. So in my opinion, the horizon for our cooperation and exchanges is vast. There are endless possibilities which have not been explored.""Mutual learning Chinese President Xi Jinping replied to a letter from Virvidakis and four other Greek scholars earlier in 2023, extending congratulations over the founding of the Center of Chinese and Greek Ancient Civilizations.Hailing the long history of the Chinese civilization and profound influence of the ancient Greek civilization, Xi said in the letter that more than 2,000 years ago, the two civilizations shone brightly on the two ends of the Eurasian continent, jointly making a fundamental contribution to the evolution of human civilization.Greece's golden era produced many of its great philosophers and literary giants. The era coincided with a period in China in which ""a hundred schools of thought contended with each other"" and flourished together.As early as the 4th century BC, China was known to the Greeks by a beautiful name: Sērikḗ. In the 16th century, Euclid's Elements was introduced into China, paving the way for scientific exchanges between China and the West. The story of Prometheus narrated by Aeschylus was an inspiration to many Chinese revolutionaries. The Republic by Plato and Politics by Aristotle are also among the Greek classics known to have long made a name for themselves in China.In the eyes of Virvidakis, Chinese civilization has always been a culture that attracts people though the language is difficult. However, Chinese art, Chinese painting, Chinese poetry, especially love poems, even detective stories about China, are incredibly fascinating. Chinese director Zhang Yimou, and movies like Farewell My Concubine and Raise the Red Lantern starring Gong Li, are also very popular. Greek archaeologists who are interested in Chinese archeology want to know how China explores the past.In other art forms, the mythology and theater, ""we have tragedy, which is our own tradition. You have Chinese opera with music."" Actors and artists always want to study similarities and look at the differences, which is also the commitment of the center to promoting exchanges and mutual learning between the two civilizations and promoting the development of civilizations in various countries. China also has this appeal because people in the West think ""it's very different, it's exotic, something strange, but then they realize that it's beautiful for them."" So ""they find a lot of aspects that they have not thought about before in order to understand.""

Tiantan, a UNESCO World Heritage Site built in 1420, in Beijing Photo: VCGPhilosophy, a way of life There is a feeling among some people in the West that the Chinese system is different in some ways, said the professor. For instance,the European and American systems place great emphasis on individual rights, but China takes a more holistic approach in which ""harmony, social harmony is more important in sovereign.""""We are not exactly the same and there are also differences. But I don't believe in the so-called clash of civilizations theory that the clash is very deep and we can't live together with our differences,"" he told the Global Times. ""In fact we can live together and have peaceful exchanges. As I said, I don't think there is any danger of Greece threatening China or China occupying Greece.""In February, Virvidakis held a lecture at the center's launching ceremony, titled Philosophy is a Way of Life. Philosophy is not just theory, he said, noting that in ancient Greece and China it didn't mean just making theories about the universe, nature, god, or much of the unknown world. ""It told you how to 'organize' your life to feel happy and achieve harmony with others."" Western philosophy cannot be understood just by itself as there are also Chinese and Indian schools of philosophy among others. ""It is easier to see some similarities in ideas between Confucius and Socrates or Confucius and Aristotle,"" said Virvidakis, explaining why he is so fond of Chinese philosophy, especially Confucius thought. A simple question about what is a good life has a variety of answers in different philosophical theories.  But studying philosophy is practical and a way of life. Modern people don't just derive happiness from materialism. They need art and other emotionally stirring elements in life. In different parts and different cultures of the world,people can share similarities in emotion and sentiment.Virvidakis said that one of the most important reasons for his involving in such studies and exchanges was because ""I'm interested and I want to learn more. I'm a student too. When you are a teacher in your whole life, you're going to be a student.""",ARTS,CULTURE & LEISURE,The University of Athens Photo: VCG,"Reporter, Beijing","Global Times senior reporter, mainly covers the reporting of movies, TV, music and culture news.",43,880,<FreqDist with 16 samples and 473 outcomes>

 The first Saudi ambassador to Palestine Naif bin Bandar Al-Sudairi arrived in the West Bank on Tuesday, the official Palestinian news agency WAFA reported.Leading an official delegation, Al-Sudairi, the non-resident ambassador to Palestine and non-resident consul general in Jerusalem, presented his credentials to Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas at the presidency headquarters in Ramallah, it said.Al-Sudairi's arrival comes amid Israel's efforts to normalize relations with Saudi Arabia.During their meeting, Abbas welcomed Al-Sudairi and said his visit to Palestine and his appointment as Saudi ambassador to the State of Palestine would contribute to ""strengthening the strong fraternal relations that bind the two countries and the two brotherly peoples.""The Saudi ambassador said he hoped that his visit would be ""a successful beginning for strengthening relations in all fields,"" stressing his country's firm and supportive positions for the Palestinian people and their just cause.Earlier in the day, Al-Sudairi told reporters in a statement that ""the Arab Peace Initiative is the basic point in any upcoming agreement,"" after being asked about the fate of the initiative in the event of reaching a normalization deal between Saudi Arabia and Israel.The Arab Peace Initiative was launched in 2002 after it was drafted by Saudi Arabia and adopted by the Arab League.The initiative calls for an end to the conflict between Israel and Palestine and the normalization of relations between Israel and Arab states, in exchange for an Israeli withdrawal from the areas it gained since 1967 and proper settlement to the issue of Palestinian refugees.The Palestinians demanded the establishment of an independent state alongside Israel in all of the Palestinian territories occupied by Israel in 1967, including the entire West Bank and the Gaza Strip, with East Jerusalem as its capital.The Saudi ambassador also confirmed that his country intends to open a consulate in East Jerusalem soon.",PHOTO,WORLD,"Saudi ambassador to Palestine Naif bin Bandar Al-Sudairi (Front) arrives at the Palestinian foreign ministry headquarters in the West Bank city of Ramallah, on Sept. 26, 2023.(Photo: Xinhua)",Author details not found,Author details not found,12,313,<FreqDist with 15 samples and 181 outcomes>
China releases a white paper on its proposals and actions on building a global community of shared future,GT staff reporters,2023-09-26," The Chinese government released a white paper on Tuesday to introduce the theoretical base, practice and development of a global community of shared future, as by presenting China's vision of the course of human development, it counters the hegemonic thinking of certain countries that seek supremacy. The white paper, titled ""A Global Community of Shared Future: China's Proposals and Actions,"" introduced the background for China to raise the concept of a global community of shared future as the world is undergoing changes on a scale unseen in a century with various problems posing unprecedented challenges for human society. The zero-sum game is doomed to fail, the white paper said. But certain countries still cling to this mindset, blindly pursuing absolute security and monopolistic advantages, which will do nothing for their development in the long run but create a major threat to the world. It is increasingly obvious that the obsession with superior strength, and the zero-sum mentality are in conflict with the needs of our times, the white paper said, pointing out that the new era calls for new ideas. To build a global community of shared future is to pursue openness, inclusiveness, mutual benefit, equity and justice, the white paper said. The goal is not to replace one system or civilization with another. Instead, it is about countries with different social systems, ideologies, histories, shared rights, and shared responsibilities in global affairs. The vision of a global community of shared future stands on the right side of history and on the side of human progress. It introduces a new approach for international relations, provides new ideas for global governance, opens up new prospects for international exchanges and draws a new blueprint for a better world, according to the white paper. Such important vision transcends outdated mindsets such as zero-sum game, power politics, and Cold War confrontations. It has become the overall goal of China's major-country diplomacy in the new era, and a great banner that leads the trend of the times and the direction of human progress. The concept of a global community of shared future has deep roots in China's profound cultural heritage and its unique experience of modernization. It carries forward the diplomatic traditions of China and draws on the outstanding achievements of all other civilizations, the white paper said. It also manifests China's time-honored historical traditions, distinct characteristics of the times, and a wealth of humanistic values.  The white paper also pointed out the direction and plan to build a global community of shared future including pressing ahead with a new type of economic globalization in which countries need to pursue a policy of openness and explicitly oppose protectionism, the erection of fences and barriers, unilateral sanctions, and maximum-pressure tactics, so as to connect economies and jointly build an open world economy. Some countries are seeking to decouple from China, enclosing themselves in ""small yards, high fences,"" which will ultimately only backfire, the white paper said. Also, some people overstate the need to ""reduce dependence"" and ""de-risk,"" which is essentially creating new risks. The direction and the plan also include following a peaceful development plan, fostering a new type of international relations, practicing true multilateralism and promoting the common values of humanity. Over the past decade, China has contributed its strength to building a global community of shared future with firm conviction and solid actions. For instance, by July 2023, more than three-quarters of countries in the world and over 30 international organizations had signed agreements on Belt and Road cooperation with China. The BRI originated in China but the opportunities and achievements it creates belong to the whole world. It's an initiative for economic cooperation, not for geopolitical or military alliances, and it's open and inclusive process that neither targets nor excludes any party, the white paper said. Among those BRI projects, for example, the China-Laos Railway began operation on December 3, 2021, with 167 tunnels and 301 bridges built in 11 years along its total length of 1,035 kilometers. The railway construction created more than 110,000 local jobs, and helped build about 2,000 kilometers of roads and canals for villages along the railway, benefiting local people. Besides the BRI, the Global Development Initiative, the Global Security Initiative and Global Civilization Initiative have evolved into a crucial cornerstone for building a global community of shared future, offering China's solutions to major challenges pertaining to peace and development for humanity. Facing constant flare-ups of hotspot issues, China has been committed to fulfilling its role as a responsible major country, pushing for the resolution of international and regional flashpoints, such as the Korean Peninsula, Palestine, the Iranian nuclear issue, Syria and Afghanistan, the white paper said. On the Ukraine issue, China has actively promoted talks for peace, put forth four points, four things that the international community should do together and three observations, and released China's position on the political settlement of the Ukraine crisis and has dispatched the special representative of the Chinese government on Eurasian affairs to engage in extensive interactions and exchanges with stakeholders on the political settlement of the Ukraine crisis. Also, through the mediation of China, Saudi Arabia and Iran achieve historic reconciliation earlier this year, setting a fine example for countries in the region to resolve disputes and differences and achieve good neighborly relations through dialogue and consultation, and catalyzing a wave of reconciliation in the Middle East. China has also proposed a range of regional and bilateral initiatives on building communities of shared future and working with stakeholders to build consensus and expand cooperation, there by playing a constructive role in promoting regional peace and development. It also boosts international cooperation in fields including fighting the COVID-19 pandemic, addressing disorder in cyberspace governance and dealing with the global climate challenge. Over the past decade, the vision of a global community of shared future has gained broader support. More countries and people have come to the understanding that this vision serves the common interests of humanity, represents popular calls for peace, justice and progress, and can create the greatest synergy among all nations for building a better world, the white paper said.",CHINA,POLITICS,Photo: Li Xuanmin/GT,Author details not found,Author details not found,33,1000,<FreqDist with 17 samples and 603 outcomes>

F-35: Closer Look at Colossally Costly Jet That Just Can’t Seem to Stay Airborne,Sputnik,2023-09-21,"A US Marine Corps F-35B went down over South Carolina on Sunday after its pilot ejected mid-flight for reasons unknown. Why do F-35s seem so crash-prone? What’s wrong with them? And what role does the waste and fraud in the US military-industrial complex play in creating such a Frankenstein’s monster of an aircraft? Sputnik explores.Debris from the F-35B that went missing over South Carolina on September 17 was found in Williamsburg County, South Carolina, about two hours northeast of Joint Base Charleston on Monday following more than a day of frantic searching by the military. An as yet unspecified “mishap” was blamed for the accident. The pilot escaped unscathed.“The mishap is currently under investigation, and we are unable to provide additional details to preserve the integrity of the investigative process,” the Marine Corps said in a statement Monday. The Marines ordered a two-day global pause in all aerial operations, with the errant F-35B becoming the third major aviation-related accident suffered by the military branch in less than two months.Air units will be discussing “fundamentals of safe flight operations, ground safety, maintenance and flight procedures, and maintaining combat readiness,” the Marine Corps said.How Many F-35s Have Been Lost?Since it started being introduced into service with the Marines (2015), the US Air Force (2016), and the US Navy (2019) and began to be exported to foreign clients (starting with Israel in 2018), the F-35 has gained an unenviable reputation of being a costly, buggy, and crash-prone jet, with the F-35B that went down over South Carolina last week being at least the 11th Lightning II lost since 2018.On September 28, 2018, a US Marine Corps F-35B crashed during a flight near Marine Corps Air Station Beaufort in South Carolina, with a faulty fuel tube blamed for the incident. The pilot emerged unscathed.On April 9, 2019, a Japanese Self- Defense Force F-35A went down off Honshu, Japan. The pilot was killed after losing his bearings and suffering “special disorientation” mid-flight over the ocean.On May 19, 2020, a US Air Force F-35A from the 58th Fighter Squadron crashed while performing a landing at Eglin Air Force Base in western Florida. Pilot error (trying to land at excessive speed) and a mechanical defect related to a flight control glitch that left the plane’s tail unresponsive were blamed. The pilot survived.On September 29, 2020, a US Marine Corps F-35B was lost over Imperial County, California after colliding with a KC-130 tanker during midflight refueling. The tanker crew managed to bring their aircraft down for a hard landing. The F-35 pilot ejected successfully.On November 17, 2021, a British Royal Air Force F-35B plunged into the Mediterranean Sea after its pilot ejected during routine operations. That crash was ultimately blamed on a protective cover getting wedged into the plane’s engine intake.On January 4, 2022, a South Korean Air Force F-35A suffering from issues with its onboard avionics carried out an emergency belly landing. Investigators blamed a bird striking the warplane’s landing gear mid-flight. The pilot emerged unharmed.On January 24, 2022, a US Navy F-35C plunged into the South China Sea after making a hard landing on the USS Carl Vinson super carrier. The pilot and six sailors on the deck of the aircraft carrier were injured. A Navy investigation attributed the incident to pilot error.On October 19, 2022, another F-35, this one from the US Air Force, crashed at Hill Air Force Base in Utah during a training mission. The pilot ejected safely. It was later determined that turbulent air somehow confused the jet’s onboard avionics to the point where the aircraft became uncontrollable.On December 1, 2022, a Marine Corps F-35B collapsed on a military base in Japan after suffering a landing gear failure during training. No one was injured.Finally, on December 15, 2022, a US Navy F-35B crashed while attempting to perform a vertical landing at Naval Air Station Joint Reserve Base Fort Worth in Texas during testing of the jet’s systems. A “harmonic resonance” issue related to the jet’s Pratt & Whitney F135 engine was blamed, with the Pentagon halting further F-35 deliveries by Lockheed until an investigation was concluded.What’s Wrong With the F-35?Nearly 17 years after the F-35’s first flight, and eight years after its adoption into service, the F-35 continues to maintain a troublingly long list of technical bugs affecting both hardware and software. The aircraft, which has an astronomical total estimated purchase and sustainment price tag of over $1.7 trillion, and a per-plane cost of $70-$90 million, has faced years of harsh criticism from US officials, including former President Donald Trump at one point, who said the jet’s costs had spiraled “out of control.”At its heart, the F-35 is the product of an idea that metastasized in the Pentagon after the end of the Cold War, envisioning an all-in-one fighter platform which could be used by every branch of the military, equipped with vertical take-off and landing capability, and carry out a broad array of missions using a variety of onboard weapons. The do-it-all jet was supposed to replace nearly all of America’s fourth-gen fighter, strike, and ground attack aircraft, including the F-16 Falcon, the F/A-18 Hornet and Super Hornet, the AV-8B Harrier II, and others.The jet features just a single onboard engine – the aforementioned Pratt & Whitney F135, with engine-related troubles not only regularly referred to by watchdogs as a “leading driver” of the F-35’s problems remaining “mission capable,” but also making its operation over enemy territory or over the sea risky, since if something goes wrong, the plane doesn’t have a backup engine to limp home with.Throughout its production cycle, the F-35 Lightning II has suffered a dizzying and seemingly endless list of technical problems, from neck-snapping ejection seats to problems, ironically, while operating in stormy weather.In its 2023 report, the congressional Government Accountability Office revealed that the F-35 program “continues to experience schedule delays, cost growth, and late deliveries,” with procurement costs jumping by $13.4 billion since 2019, and modernization behind schedule and over budget.“As of January 2023, of the 821 open deficiencies, the program office characterized five of these as category 1 [i.e. critical issues which could jeopardize flight safety and security], and 816 as category 2, [i.e. those which could impede or constrain mission success].”In all, between December 2006 and 2023, the GAO has reported a whopping 277 category 1 and 2,467 category 2 deficiencies with the aircraft, among them serious issues like cabin over-pressurization, problems with the jets’ night vision systems, software bugs, radar issues, corrosion, ejection seats which could snap pilots’ necks, etc.Is a Culture of Largess to Blame?Sunday’s accident in South Carolina is the latest piece of F-35-related bad news for Lockheed Martin. In June, it was reported that the Pentagon had halted the delivery of any additional upgraded F-35s until major issues related to new Technology Refresh 3 (TR-3) hardware and weapons-related software were resolved. DoD F-35 program director Mike Schmidt told Congress in March that the risk assessment related to the TR-3 hardware upgrade wouldn’t be finished until April 2024.Despite the delays and array of technical problems, the weapons giant has continued to rack up generous contracts related to F-35 procurement and production. For example, in July, the US Navy ordered a $490 million package of equipment from Lockheed “to procure various material mod kits, special test/tooling equipment, as well as…product engineering” for already delivered, but defective planes. In August, Lockheed received another $606 million “fixed-price incentive (firm-target) undefinitized” contract “for long lead time materials, parts, components, and efforts to support of maintaining on-time production and delivery of 173 Lot 19 F-35 Joint Strike Fighter aircraft for Foreign Military Sales (FMS) customers and non-US Department of Defense (DOD) participants.”The terms of the contracts seem to be the culprit behind the F-35’s soaring costs (and Lockheed’s soaring profits, despite delivery of defective products), with so-called “cost-plus” and “undefinitized” contracts effectively making any overruns the buyer’s problem – i.e. that of US taxpayers, and of citizens of any country unfortunate enough to pen contracts for the planes from Lockheed.What About America’s Competitors?The worst part about the F-35’s troublesome history seems to be that the F-35 has already become ""obsolete"" in the sense that many of the US and NATO’s competitors have obtained the ability to defeat them, with Russia and China gaining capabilities to track and target the jets going back to the mid-to-late 2010s. In April, Iran announced that its engineers had created advanced radar technologies to not only detect F-35s, but identify the radar signature of individual F-35 planes, enabling the Islamic Republic to plan defensive operations accordingly.",WORLD,AMERICAS,Picture description not found,Author details not found,Author details not found,60,1305,<FreqDist with 18 samples and 775 outcomes>
Toxic explosion in Nebraska shows US unable to take issues affecting public security seriously: experts,Xu Yelu,2023-09-15,"Barely two months after an explosion in Louisiana, a train carrying toxic perchloric acid has exploded in a Nebraska rail yard on Thursday, prompting evacuation orders to be issued, as huge plumes are seen engulfing the city. Experts said the incident shows the US has been unable to take seriously and overcome major issues affecting public safety and the environment and ecology in the country.The incident happened on Union Pacific Railroad tracks in the city of North Platte. North Platte Volunteer Fire Department announced that they would order those living in the area to evacuate due to the toxic smoke from the railroad, according to media reports.In a post on social media platforms, it said that ""Emergency evacuation for the area between splinter and front North of railroad track due fire at the railroad involving heavy toxic smoke.""In a statement to DailyMail.com, Union Pacific Railroad said that an explosion occurred inside a container which resulted in several railcars catching fire. The railcar did not derail, the company said, and had been in the yard for several hours.Union Pacific said that one of the containers contained a hazardous chemical called perchloric acid, according to Daily Mail.Perchloric is a hazardous material used in food, drugs and biocidal products, as well as explosives, according to the report.Two months ago, a fire at a Louisiana chemical plant triggered explosions that shook homes several miles away and sent flames and smoke billowing into the air in mid-July, prompting emergency officials to urge a few hundred nearby residents to shelter indoors for several hours and to turn off their air conditioners, the Associated Press reported.Antiquated infrastructure and the outdated transportation were one factor. Another was a flawed system of governance in the US transport industry, experts noted. There is no doubt that the US has serious loopholes in the transportation management of hazardous substances, and the relevant error correction mechanism is in fact not effective, which means that this kind of thing will occur in the future, Li Haidong, a professor at the China Foreign Affairs University, told the Global Times on Friday.This shows that the US has been unable to take seriously and overcome serious and major issues affecting public safety and the environment and ecology in the country, Li said. ""It must be said that this is a great irony to the self-proclaimed internal governance of the most advanced country in the world.""Analysts said that the frequent occurrence of similar incidents shows that the error correction mechanism in the US has failed. Apart from this, racism and the proliferation of guns are also clear examples of the failure of error correction mechanisms, experts noted.",WORLD,AMERICAS,"A resident of East Palestine in the state of Ohio, US, angrily points during a town hall meeting held by the US

Greek scholar believes in ‘endless possibilities and vast land’ between China-Greece exchanges,Xu Liuliu,2023-09-14,"Chongqing, Sichuan, Shandong… Stelios Virvidakis expectantly plans his next China tour before a visit by the Global Times at his office in Athens, Greece. The University of Athens professor has grown far busier recently since he and four other Greek scholars launched the Center of Chinese and Greek Ancient Civilizations in February. Over the summer, the center has received two scholars from China who have given lectures on the history of China, and other visiting guests from places like Israel, who offered their views on Chinese medicine and its history, and a lecturer from France with insights in Chinese mathematics and how scholars in ancient China studied the living science.""Students found them to be very interesting and greatly appreciated the lectures,"" Virvidakis told the Global Times. ""Greece and China share so many similarities. So in my opinion, the horizon for our cooperation and exchanges is vast. There are endless possibilities which have not been explored.""Mutual learning Chinese President Xi Jinping replied to a letter from Virvidakis and four other Greek scholars earlier in 2023, extending congratulations over the founding of the Center of Chinese and Greek Ancient Civilizations.Hailing the long history of the Chinese civilization and profound influence of the ancient Greek civilization, Xi said in the letter that more than 2,000 years ago, the two civilizations shone brightly on the two ends of the Eurasian continent, jointly making a fundamental contribution to the evolution of human civilization.Greece's golden era produced many of its great philosophers and literary giants. The era coincided with a period in China in which ""a hundred schools of thought contended with each other"" and flourished together.As early as the 4th century BC, China was known to the Greeks by a beautiful name: Sērikḗ. In the 16th century, Euclid's Elements was introduced into China, paving the way for scientific exchanges between China and the West. The story of Prometheus narrated by Aeschylus was an inspiration to many Chinese revolutionaries. The Republic by Plato and Politics by Aristotle are also among the Greek classics known to have long made a name for themselves in China.In the eyes of Virvidakis, Chinese civilization has always been a culture that attracts people though the language is difficult. However, Chinese art, Chinese painting, Chinese poetry, especially love poems, even detective stories about China, are incredibly fascinating. Chinese director Zhang Yimou, and movies like Farewell My Concubine and Raise the Red Lantern starring Gong Li, are also very popular. Greek archaeologists who are interested in Chinese archeology want to know how China explores the past.In other art forms, the mythology and theater, ""we have tragedy, which is our own tradition. You have Chinese opera with music."" Actors and artists always want to study similarities and look at the differences, which is also the commitment of the center to promoting exchanges and mutual learning between the two civilizations and promoting the development of civilizations in various countries. China also has this appeal because people in the West think ""it's very different, it's exotic, something strange, but then they realize that it's beautiful for them."" So ""they find a lot of aspects that they have not thought about before in order to understand.""

Tiantan, a UNESCO World Heritage Site built in 1420, in Beijing Photo: VCGPhilosophy, a way of life There is a feeling among some people in the West that the Chinese system is different in some ways, said the professor. For instance,the European and American systems place great emphasis on individual rights, but China takes a more holistic approach in which ""harmony, social harmony is more important in sovereign.""""We are not exactly the same and there are also differences. But I don't believe in the so-called clash of civilizations theory that the clash is very deep and we can't live together with our differences,"" he told the Global Times. ""In fact we can live together and have peaceful exchanges. As I said, I don't think there is any danger of Greece threatening China or China occupying Greece.""In February, Virvidakis held a lecture at the center's launching ceremony, titled Philosophy is a Way of Life. Philosophy is not just theory, he said, noting that in ancient Greece and China it didn't mean just making theories about the universe, nature, god, or much of the unknown world. ""It told you how to 'organize' your life to feel happy and achieve harmony with others."" Western philosophy cannot be understood just by itself as there are also Chinese and Indian schools of philosophy among others. ""It is easier to see some similarities in ideas between Confucius and Socrates or Confucius and Aristotle,"" said Virvidakis, explaining why he is so fond of Chinese philosophy, especially Confucius thought. A simple question about what is a good life has a variety of answers in different philosophical theories.  But studying philosophy is practical and a way of life. Modern people don't just derive happiness from materialism. They need art and other emotionally stirring elements in life. In different parts and different cultures of the world,people can share similarities in emotion and sentiment.Virvidakis said that one of the most important reasons for his involving in such studies and exchanges was because ""I'm interested and I want to learn more. I'm a student too. When you are a teacher in your whole life, you're going to be a student.""",ARTS,CULTURE & LEISURE,The University of Athens Photo: VCG,"Reporter, Beijing","Global Times senior reporter, mainly covers the reporting of movies, TV, music and culture news.",43,880,<FreqDist with 16 samples and 473 outcomes>

 The first Saudi ambassador to Palestine Naif bin Bandar Al-Sudairi arrived in the West Bank on Tuesday, the official Palestinian news agency WAFA reported.Leading an official delegation, Al-Sudairi, the non-resident ambassador to Palestine and non-resident consul general in Jerusalem, presented his credentials to Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas at the presidency headquarters in Ramallah, it said.Al-Sudairi's arrival comes amid Israel's efforts to normalize relations with Saudi Arabia.During their meeting, Abbas welcomed Al-Sudairi and said his visit to Palestine and his appointment as Saudi ambassador to the State of Palestine would contribute to ""strengthening the strong fraternal relations that bind the two countries and the two brotherly peoples.""The Saudi ambassador said he hoped that his visit would be ""a successful beginning for strengthening relations in all fields,"" stressing his country's firm and supportive positions for the Palestinian people and their just cause.Earlier in the day, Al-Sudairi told reporters in a statement that ""the Arab Peace Initiative is the basic point in any upcoming agreement,"" after being asked about the fate of the initiative in the event of reaching a normalization deal between Saudi Arabia and Israel.The Arab Peace Initiative was launched in 2002 after it was drafted by Saudi Arabia and adopted by the Arab League.The initiative calls for an end to the conflict between Israel and Palestine and the normalization of relations between Israel and Arab states, in exchange for an Israeli withdrawal from the areas it gained since 1967 and proper settlement to the issue of Palestinian refugees.The Palestinians demanded the establishment of an independent state alongside Israel in all of the Palestinian territories occupied by Israel in 1967, including the entire West Bank and the Gaza Strip, with East Jerusalem as its capital.The Saudi ambassador also confirmed that his country intends to open a consulate in East Jerusalem soon.",PHOTO,WORLD,"Saudi ambassador to Palestine Naif bin Bandar Al-Sudairi (Front) arrives at the Palestinian foreign ministry headquarters in the West Bank city of Ramallah, on Sept. 26, 2023.(Photo: Xinhua)",Author details not found,Author details not found,12,313,<FreqDist with 15 samples and 181 outcomes>
China releases a white paper on its proposals and actions on building a global community of shared future,GT staff reporters,2023-09-26," The Chinese government released a white paper on Tuesday to introduce the theoretical base, practice and development of a global community of shared future, as by presenting China's vision of the course of human development, it counters the hegemonic thinking of certain countries that seek supremacy. The white paper, titled ""A Global Community of Shared Future: China's Proposals and Actions,"" introduced the background for China to raise the concept of a global community of shared future as the world is undergoing changes on a scale unseen in a century with various problems posing unprecedented challenges for human society. The zero-sum game is doomed to fail, the white paper said. But certain countries still cling to this mindset, blindly pursuing absolute security and monopolistic advantages, which will do nothing for their development in the long run but create a major threat to the world. It is increasingly obvious that the obsession with superior strength, and the zero-sum mentality are in conflict with the needs of our times, the white paper said, pointing out that the new era calls for new ideas. To build a global community of shared future is to pursue openness, inclusiveness, mutual benefit, equity and justice, the white paper said. The goal is not to replace one system or civilization with another. Instead, it is about countries with different social systems, ideologies, histories, shared rights, and shared responsibilities in global affairs. The vision of a global community of shared future stands on the right side of history and on the side of human progress. It introduces a new approach for international relations, provides new ideas for global governance, opens up new prospects for international exchanges and draws a new blueprint for a better world, according to the white paper. Such important vision transcends outdated mindsets such as zero-sum game, power politics, and Cold War confrontations. It has become the overall goal of China's major-country diplomacy in the new era, and a great banner that leads the trend of the times and the direction of human progress. The concept of a global community of shared future has deep roots in China's profound cultural heritage and its unique experience of modernization. It carries forward the diplomatic traditions of China and draws on the outstanding achievements of all other civilizations, the white paper said. It also manifests China's time-honored historical traditions, distinct characteristics of the times, and a wealth of humanistic values.  The white paper also pointed out the direction and plan to build a global community of shared future including pressing ahead with a new type of economic globalization in which countries need to pursue a policy of openness and explicitly oppose protectionism, the erection of fences and barriers, unilateral sanctions, and maximum-pressure tactics, so as to connect economies and jointly build an open world economy. Some countries are seeking to decouple from China, enclosing themselves in ""small yards, high fences,"" which will ultimately only backfire, the white paper said. Also, some people overstate the need to ""reduce dependence"" and ""de-risk,"" which is essentially creating new risks. The direction and the plan also include following a peaceful development plan, fostering a new type of international relations, practicing true multilateralism and promoting the common values of humanity. Over the past decade, China has contributed its strength to building a global community of shared future with firm conviction and solid actions. For instance, by July 2023, more than three-quarters of countries in the world and over 30 international organizations had signed agreements on Belt and Road cooperation with China. The BRI originated in China but the opportunities and achievements it creates belong to the whole world. It's an initiative for economic cooperation, not for geopolitical or military alliances, and it's open and inclusive process that neither targets nor excludes any party, the white paper said. Among those BRI projects, for example, the China-Laos Railway began operation on December 3, 2021, with 167 tunnels and 301 bridges built in 11 years along its total length of 1,035 kilometers. The railway construction created more than 110,000 local jobs, and helped build about 2,000 kilometers of roads and canals for villages along the railway, benefiting local people. Besides the BRI, the Global Development Initiative, the Global Security Initiative and Global Civilization Initiative have evolved into a crucial cornerstone for building a global community of shared future, offering China's solutions to major challenges pertaining to peace and development for humanity. Facing constant flare-ups of hotspot issues, China has been committed to fulfilling its role as a responsible major country, pushing for the resolution of international and regional flashpoints, such as the Korean Peninsula, Palestine, the Iranian nuclear issue, Syria and Afghanistan, the white paper said. On the Ukraine issue, China has actively promoted talks for peace, put forth four points, four things that the international community should do together and three observations, and released China's position on the political settlement of the Ukraine crisis and has dispatched the special representative of the Chinese government on Eurasian affairs to engage in extensive interactions and exchanges with stakeholders on the political settlement of the Ukraine crisis. Also, through the mediation of China, Saudi Arabia and Iran achieve historic reconciliation earlier this year, setting a fine example for countries in the region to resolve disputes and differences and achieve good neighborly relations through dialogue and consultation, and catalyzing a wave of reconciliation in the Middle East. China has also proposed a range of regional and bilateral initiatives on building communities of shared future and working with stakeholders to build consensus and expand cooperation, there by playing a constructive role in promoting regional peace and development. It also boosts international cooperation in fields including fighting the COVID-19 pandemic, addressing disorder in cyberspace governance and dealing with the global climate challenge. Over the past decade, the vision of a global community of shared future has gained broader support. More countries and people have come to the understanding that this vision serves the common interests of humanity, represents popular calls for peace, justice and progress, and can create the greatest synergy among all nations for building a better world, the white paper said.",CHINA,POLITICS,Photo: Li Xuanmin/GT,Author details not found,Author details not found,33,1000,<FreqDist with 17 samples and 603 outcomes>

F-35: Closer Look at Colossally Costly Jet That Just Can’t Seem to Stay Airborne,Sputnik,2023-09-21,"A US Marine Corps F-35B went down over South Carolina on Sunday after its pilot ejected mid-flight for reasons unknown. Why do F-35s seem so crash-prone? What’s wrong with them? And what role does the waste and fraud in the US military-industrial complex play in creating such a Frankenstein’s monster of an aircraft? Sputnik explores.Debris from the F-35B that went missing over South Carolina on September 17 was found in Williamsburg County, South Carolina, about two hours northeast of Joint Base Charleston on Monday following more than a day of frantic searching by the military. An as yet unspecified “mishap” was blamed for the accident. The pilot escaped unscathed.“The mishap is currently under investigation, and we are unable to provide additional details to preserve the integrity of the investigative process,” the Marine Corps said in a statement Monday. The Marines ordered a two-day global pause in all aerial operations, with the errant F-35B becoming the third major aviation-related accident suffered by the military branch in less than two months.Air units will be discussing “fundamentals of safe flight operations, ground safety, maintenance and flight procedures, and maintaining combat readiness,” the Marine Corps said.How Many F-35s Have Been Lost?Since it started being introduced into service with the Marines (2015), the US Air Force (2016), and the US Navy (2019) and began to be exported to foreign clients (starting with Israel in 2018), the F-35 has gained an unenviable reputation of being a costly, buggy, and crash-prone jet, with the F-35B that went down over South Carolina last week being at least the 11th Lightning II lost since 2018.On September 28, 2018, a US Marine Corps F-35B crashed during a flight near Marine Corps Air Station Beaufort in South Carolina, with a faulty fuel tube blamed for the incident. The pilot emerged unscathed.On April 9, 2019, a Japanese Self- Defense Force F-35A went down off Honshu, Japan. The pilot was killed after losing his bearings and suffering “special disorientation” mid-flight over the ocean.On May 19, 2020, a US Air Force F-35A from the 58th Fighter Squadron crashed while performing a landing at Eglin Air Force Base in western Florida. Pilot error (trying to land at excessive speed) and a mechanical defect related to a flight control glitch that left the plane’s tail unresponsive were blamed. The pilot survived.On September 29, 2020, a US Marine Corps F-35B was lost over Imperial County, California after colliding with a KC-130 tanker during midflight refueling. The tanker crew managed to bring their aircraft down for a hard landing. The F-35 pilot ejected successfully.On November 17, 2021, a British Royal Air Force F-35B plunged into the Mediterranean Sea after its pilot ejected during routine operations. That crash was ultimately blamed on a protective cover getting wedged into the plane’s engine intake.On January 4, 2022, a South Korean Air Force F-35A suffering from issues with its onboard avionics carried out an emergency belly landing. Investigators blamed a bird striking the warplane’s landing gear mid-flight. The pilot emerged unharmed.On January 24, 2022, a US Navy F-35C plunged into the South China Sea after making a hard landing on the USS Carl Vinson super carrier. The pilot and six sailors on the deck of the aircraft carrier were injured. A Navy investigation attributed the incident to pilot error.On October 19, 2022, another F-35, this one from the US Air Force, crashed at Hill Air Force Base in Utah during a training mission. The pilot ejected safely. It was later determined that turbulent air somehow confused the jet’s onboard avionics to the point where the aircraft became uncontrollable.On December 1, 2022, a Marine Corps F-35B collapsed on a military base in Japan after suffering a landing gear failure during training. No one was injured.Finally, on December 15, 2022, a US Navy F-35B crashed while attempting to perform a vertical landing at Naval Air Station Joint Reserve Base Fort Worth in Texas during testing of the jet’s systems. A “harmonic resonance” issue related to the jet’s Pratt & Whitney F135 engine was blamed, with the Pentagon halting further F-35 deliveries by Lockheed until an investigation was concluded.What’s Wrong With the F-35?Nearly 17 years after the F-35’s first flight, and eight years after its adoption into service, the F-35 continues to maintain a troublingly long list of technical bugs affecting both hardware and software. The aircraft, which has an astronomical total estimated purchase and sustainment price tag of over $1.7 trillion, and a per-plane cost of $70-$90 million, has faced years of harsh criticism from US officials, including former President Donald Trump at one point, who said the jet’s costs had spiraled “out of control.”At its heart, the F-35 is the product of an idea that metastasized in the Pentagon after the end of the Cold War, envisioning an all-in-one fighter platform which could be used by every branch of the military, equipped with vertical take-off and landing capability, and carry out a broad array of missions using a variety of onboard weapons. The do-it-all jet was supposed to replace nearly all of America’s fourth-gen fighter, strike, and ground attack aircraft, including the F-16 Falcon, the F/A-18 Hornet and Super Hornet, the AV-8B Harrier II, and others.The jet features just a single onboard engine – the aforementioned Pratt & Whitney F135, with engine-related troubles not only regularly referred to by watchdogs as a “leading driver” of the F-35’s problems remaining “mission capable,” but also making its operation over enemy territory or over the sea risky, since if something goes wrong, the plane doesn’t have a backup engine to limp home with.Throughout its production cycle, the F-35 Lightning II has suffered a dizzying and seemingly endless list of technical problems, from neck-snapping ejection seats to problems, ironically, while operating in stormy weather.In its 2023 report, the congressional Government Accountability Office revealed that the F-35 program “continues to experience schedule delays, cost growth, and late deliveries,” with procurement costs jumping by $13.4 billion since 2019, and modernization behind schedule and over budget.“As of January 2023, of the 821 open deficiencies, the program office characterized five of these as category 1 [i.e. critical issues which could jeopardize flight safety and security], and 816 as category 2, [i.e. those which could impede or constrain mission success].”In all, between December 2006 and 2023, the GAO has reported a whopping 277 category 1 and 2,467 category 2 deficiencies with the aircraft, among them serious issues like cabin over-pressurization, problems with the jets’ night vision systems, software bugs, radar issues, corrosion, ejection seats which could snap pilots’ necks, etc.Is a Culture of Largess to Blame?Sunday’s accident in South Carolina is the latest piece of F-35-related bad news for Lockheed Martin. In June, it was reported that the Pentagon had halted the delivery of any additional upgraded F-35s until major issues related to new Technology Refresh 3 (TR-3) hardware and weapons-related software were resolved. DoD F-35 program director Mike Schmidt told Congress in March that the risk assessment related to the TR-3 hardware upgrade wouldn’t be finished until April 2024.Despite the delays and array of technical problems, the weapons giant has continued to rack up generous contracts related to F-35 procurement and production. For example, in July, the US Navy ordered a $490 million package of equipment from Lockheed “to procure various material mod kits, special test/tooling equipment, as well as…product engineering” for already delivered, but defective planes. In August, Lockheed received another $606 million “fixed-price incentive (firm-target) undefinitized” contract “for long lead time materials, parts, components, and efforts to support of maintaining on-time production and delivery of 173 Lot 19 F-35 Joint Strike Fighter aircraft for Foreign Military Sales (FMS) customers and non-US Department of Defense (DOD) participants.”The terms of the contracts seem to be the culprit behind the F-35’s soaring costs (and Lockheed’s soaring profits, despite delivery of defective products), with so-called “cost-plus” and “undefinitized” contracts effectively making any overruns the buyer’s problem – i.e. that of US taxpayers, and of citizens of any country unfortunate enough to pen contracts for the planes from Lockheed.What About America’s Competitors?The worst part about the F-35’s troublesome history seems to be that the F-35 has already become ""obsolete"" in the sense that many of the US and NATO’s competitors have obtained the ability to defeat them, with Russia and China gaining capabilities to track and target the jets going back to the mid-to-late 2010s. In April, Iran announced that its engineers had created advanced radar technologies to not only detect F-35s, but identify the radar signature of individual F-35 planes, enabling the Islamic Republic to plan defensive operations accordingly.",WORLD,AMERICAS,Picture description not found,Author details not found,Author details not found,60,1305,<FreqDist with 18 samples and 775 outcomes>
Toxic explosion in Nebraska shows US unable to take issues affecting public security seriously: experts,Xu Yelu,2023-09-15,"Barely two months after an explosion in Louisiana, a train carrying toxic perchloric acid has exploded in a Nebraska rail yard on Thursday, prompting evacuation orders to be issued, as huge plumes are seen engulfing the city. Experts said the incident shows the US has been unable to take seriously and overcome major issues affecting public safety and the environment and ecology in the country.The incident happened on Union Pacific Railroad tracks in the city of North Platte. North Platte Volunteer Fire Department announced that they would order those living in the area to evacuate due to the toxic smoke from the railroad, according to media reports.In a post on social media platforms, it said that ""Emergency evacuation for the area between splinter and front North of railroad track due fire at the railroad involving heavy toxic smoke.""In a statement to DailyMail.com, Union Pacific Railroad said that an explosion occurred inside a container which resulted in several railcars catching fire. The railcar did not derail, the company said, and had been in the yard for several hours.Union Pacific said that one of the containers contained a hazardous chemical called perchloric acid, according to Daily Mail.Perchloric is a hazardous material used in food, drugs and biocidal products, as well as explosives, according to the report.Two months ago, a fire at a Louisiana chemical plant triggered explosions that shook homes several miles away and sent flames and smoke billowing into the air in mid-July, prompting emergency officials to urge a few hundred nearby residents to shelter indoors for several hours and to turn off their air conditioners, the Associated Press reported.Antiquated infrastructure and the outdated transportation were one factor. Another was a flawed system of governance in the US transport industry, experts noted. There is no doubt that the US has serious loopholes in the transportation management of hazardous substances, and the relevant error correction mechanism is in fact not effective, which means that this kind of thing will occur in the future, Li Haidong, a professor at the China Foreign Affairs University, told the Global Times on Friday.This shows that the US has been unable to take seriously and overcome serious and major issues affecting public safety and the environment and ecology in the country, Li said. ""It must be said that this is a great irony to the self-proclaimed internal governance of the most advanced country in the world.""Analysts said that the frequent occurrence of similar incidents shows that the error correction mechanism in the US has failed. Apart from this, racism and the proliferation of guns are also clear examples of the failure of error correction mechanisms, experts noted.",WORLD,AMERICAS,"A resident of East Palestine in the state of Ohio, US, angrily points during a town hall meeting held by the US

Greek scholar believes in ‘endless possibilities and vast land’ between China-Greece exchanges,Xu Liuliu,2023-09-14,"Chongqing, Sichuan, Shandong… Stelios Virvidakis expectantly plans his next China tour before a visit by the Global Times at his office in Athens, Greece. The University of Athens professor has grown far busier recently since he and four other Greek scholars launched the Center of Chinese and Greek Ancient Civilizations in February. Over the summer, the center has received two scholars from China who have given lectures on the history of China, and other visiting guests from places like Israel, who offered their views on Chinese medicine and its history, and a lecturer from France with insights in Chinese mathematics and how scholars in ancient China studied the living science.""Students found them to be very interesting and greatly appreciated the lectures,"" Virvidakis told the Global Times. ""Greece and China share so many similarities. So in my opinion, the horizon for our cooperation and exchanges is vast. There are endless possibilities which have not been explored.""Mutual learning Chinese President Xi Jinping replied to a letter from Virvidakis and four other Greek scholars earlier in 2023, extending congratulations over the founding of the Center of Chinese and Greek Ancient Civilizations.Hailing the long history of the Chinese civilization and profound influence of the ancient Greek civilization, Xi said in the letter that more than 2,000 years ago, the two civilizations shone brightly on the two ends of the Eurasian continent, jointly making a fundamental contribution to the evolution of human civilization.Greece's golden era produced many of its great philosophers and literary giants. The era coincided with a period in China in which ""a hundred schools of thought contended with each other"" and flourished together.As early as the 4th century BC, China was known to the Greeks by a beautiful name: Sērikḗ. In the 16th century, Euclid's Elements was introduced into China, paving the way for scientific exchanges between China and the West. The story of Prometheus narrated by Aeschylus was an inspiration to many Chinese revolutionaries. The Republic by Plato and Politics by Aristotle are also among the Greek classics known to have long made a name for themselves in China.In the eyes of Virvidakis, Chinese civilization has always been a culture that attracts people though the language is difficult. However, Chinese art, Chinese painting, Chinese poetry, especially love poems, even detective stories about China, are incredibly fascinating. Chinese director Zhang Yimou, and movies like Farewell My Concubine and Raise the Red Lantern starring Gong Li, are also very popular. Greek archaeologists who are interested in Chinese archeology want to know how China explores the past.In other art forms, the mythology and theater, ""we have tragedy, which is our own tradition. You have Chinese opera with music."" Actors and artists always want to study similarities and look at the differences, which is also the commitment of the center to promoting exchanges and mutual learning between the two civilizations and promoting the development of civilizations in various countries. China also has this appeal because people in the West think ""it's very different, it's exotic, something strange, but then they realize that it's beautiful for them."" So ""they find a lot of aspects that they have not thought about before in order to understand.""

Tiantan, a UNESCO World Heritage Site built in 1420, in Beijing Photo: VCGPhilosophy, a way of life There is a feeling among some people in the West that the Chinese system is different in some ways, said the professor. For instance,the European and American systems place great emphasis on individual rights, but China takes a more holistic approach in which ""harmony, social harmony is more important in sovereign.""""We are not exactly the same and there are also differences. But I don't believe in the so-called clash of civilizations theory that the clash is very deep and we can't live together with our differences,"" he told the Global Times. ""In fact we can live together and have peaceful exchanges. As I said, I don't think there is any danger of Greece threatening China or China occupying Greece.""In February, Virvidakis held a lecture at the center's launching ceremony, titled Philosophy is a Way of Life. Philosophy is not just theory, he said, noting that in ancient Greece and China it didn't mean just making theories about the universe, nature, god, or much of the unknown world. ""It told you how to 'organize' your life to feel happy and achieve harmony with others."" Western philosophy cannot be understood just by itself as there are also Chinese and Indian schools of philosophy among others. ""It is easier to see some similarities in ideas between Confucius and Socrates or Confucius and Aristotle,"" said Virvidakis, explaining why he is so fond of Chinese philosophy, especially Confucius thought. A simple question about what is a good life has a variety of answers in different philosophical theories.  But studying philosophy is practical and a way of life. Modern people don't just derive happiness from materialism. They need art and other emotionally stirring elements in life. In different parts and different cultures of the world,people can share similarities in emotion and sentiment.Virvidakis said that one of the most important reasons for his involving in such studies and exchanges was because ""I'm interested and I want to learn more. I'm a student too. When you are a teacher in your whole life, you're going to be a student.""",ARTS,CULTURE & LEISURE,The University of Athens Photo: VCG,"Reporter, Beijing","Global Times senior reporter, mainly covers the reporting of movies, TV, music and culture news.",43,880,<FreqDist with 16 samples and 473 outcomes>

 The first Saudi ambassador to Palestine Naif bin Bandar Al-Sudairi arrived in the West Bank on Tuesday, the official Palestinian news agency WAFA reported.Leading an official delegation, Al-Sudairi, the non-resident ambassador to Palestine and non-resident consul general in Jerusalem, presented his credentials to Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas at the presidency headquarters in Ramallah, it said.Al-Sudairi's arrival comes amid Israel's efforts to normalize relations with Saudi Arabia.During their meeting, Abbas welcomed Al-Sudairi and said his visit to Palestine and his appointment as Saudi ambassador to the State of Palestine would contribute to ""strengthening the strong fraternal relations that bind the two countries and the two brotherly peoples.""The Saudi ambassador said he hoped that his visit would be ""a successful beginning for strengthening relations in all fields,"" stressing his country's firm and supportive positions for the Palestinian people and their just cause.Earlier in the day, Al-Sudairi told reporters in a statement that ""the Arab Peace Initiative is the basic point in any upcoming agreement,"" after being asked about the fate of the initiative in the event of reaching a normalization deal between Saudi Arabia and Israel.The Arab Peace Initiative was launched in 2002 after it was drafted by Saudi Arabia and adopted by the Arab League.The initiative calls for an end to the conflict between Israel and Palestine and the normalization of relations between Israel and Arab states, in exchange for an Israeli withdrawal from the areas it gained since 1967 and proper settlement to the issue of Palestinian refugees.The Palestinians demanded the establishment of an independent state alongside Israel in all of the Palestinian territories occupied by Israel in 1967, including the entire West Bank and the Gaza Strip, with East Jerusalem as its capital.The Saudi ambassador also confirmed that his country intends to open a consulate in East Jerusalem soon.",PHOTO,WORLD,"Saudi ambassador to Palestine Naif bin Bandar Al-Sudairi (Front) arrives at the Palestinian foreign ministry headquarters in the West Bank city of Ramallah, on Sept. 26, 2023.(Photo: Xinhua)",Author details not found,Author details not found,12,313,<FreqDist with 15 samples and 181 outcomes>
China releases a white paper on its proposals and actions on building a global community of shared future,GT staff reporters,2023-09-26," The Chinese government released a white paper on Tuesday to introduce the theoretical base, practice and development of a global community of shared future, as by presenting China's vision of the course of human development, it counters the hegemonic thinking of certain countries that seek supremacy. The white paper, titled ""A Global Community of Shared Future: China's Proposals and Actions,"" introduced the background for China to raise the concept of a global community of shared future as the world is undergoing changes on a scale unseen in a century with various problems posing unprecedented challenges for human society. The zero-sum game is doomed to fail, the white paper said. But certain countries still cling to this mindset, blindly pursuing absolute security and monopolistic advantages, which will do nothing for their development in the long run but create a major threat to the world. It is increasingly obvious that the obsession with superior strength, and the zero-sum mentality are in conflict with the needs of our times, the white paper said, pointing out that the new era calls for new ideas. To build a global community of shared future is to pursue openness, inclusiveness, mutual benefit, equity and justice, the white paper said. The goal is not to replace one system or civilization with another. Instead, it is about countries with different social systems, ideologies, histories, shared rights, and shared responsibilities in global affairs. The vision of a global community of shared future stands on the right side of history and on the side of human progress. It introduces a new approach for international relations, provides new ideas for global governance, opens up new prospects for international exchanges and draws a new blueprint for a better world, according to the white paper. Such important vision transcends outdated mindsets such as zero-sum game, power politics, and Cold War confrontations. It has become the overall goal of China's major-country diplomacy in the new era, and a great banner that leads the trend of the times and the direction of human progress. The concept of a global community of shared future has deep roots in China's profound cultural heritage and its unique experience of modernization. It carries forward the diplomatic traditions of China and draws on the outstanding achievements of all other civilizations, the white paper said. It also manifests China's time-honored historical traditions, distinct characteristics of the times, and a wealth of humanistic values.  The white paper also pointed out the direction and plan to build a global community of shared future including pressing ahead with a new type of economic globalization in which countries need to pursue a policy of openness and explicitly oppose protectionism, the erection of fences and barriers, unilateral sanctions, and maximum-pressure tactics, so as to connect economies and jointly build an open world economy. Some countries are seeking to decouple from China, enclosing themselves in ""small yards, high fences,"" which will ultimately only backfire, the white paper said. Also, some people overstate the need to ""reduce dependence"" and ""de-risk,"" which is essentially creating new risks. The direction and the plan also include following a peaceful development plan, fostering a new type of international relations, practicing true multilateralism and promoting the common values of humanity. Over the past decade, China has contributed its strength to building a global community of shared future with firm conviction and solid actions. For instance, by July 2023, more than three-quarters of countries in the world and over 30 international organizations had signed agreements on Belt and Road cooperation with China. The BRI originated in China but the opportunities and achievements it creates belong to the whole world. It's an initiative for economic cooperation, not for geopolitical or military alliances, and it's open and inclusive process that neither targets nor excludes any party, the white paper said. Among those BRI projects, for example, the China-Laos Railway began operation on December 3, 2021, with 167 tunnels and 301 bridges built in 11 years along its total length of 1,035 kilometers. The railway construction created more than 110,000 local jobs, and helped build about 2,000 kilometers of roads and canals for villages along the railway, benefiting local people. Besides the BRI, the Global Development Initiative, the Global Security Initiative and Global Civilization Initiative have evolved into a crucial cornerstone for building a global community of shared future, offering China's solutions to major challenges pertaining to peace and development for humanity. Facing constant flare-ups of hotspot issues, China has been committed to fulfilling its role as a responsible major country, pushing for the resolution of international and regional flashpoints, such as the Korean Peninsula, Palestine, the Iranian nuclear issue, Syria and Afghanistan, the white paper said. On the Ukraine issue, China has actively promoted talks for peace, put forth four points, four things that the international community should do together and three observations, and released China's position on the political settlement of the Ukraine crisis and has dispatched the special representative of the Chinese government on Eurasian affairs to engage in extensive interactions and exchanges with stakeholders on the political settlement of the Ukraine crisis. Also, through the mediation of China, Saudi Arabia and Iran achieve historic reconciliation earlier this year, setting a fine example for countries in the region to resolve disputes and differences and achieve good neighborly relations through dialogue and consultation, and catalyzing a wave of reconciliation in the Middle East. China has also proposed a range of regional and bilateral initiatives on building communities of shared future and working with stakeholders to build consensus and expand cooperation, there by playing a constructive role in promoting regional peace and development. It also boosts international cooperation in fields including fighting the COVID-19 pandemic, addressing disorder in cyberspace governance and dealing with the global climate challenge. Over the past decade, the vision of a global community of shared future has gained broader support. More countries and people have come to the understanding that this vision serves the common interests of humanity, represents popular calls for peace, justice and progress, and can create the greatest synergy among all nations for building a better world, the white paper said.",CHINA,POLITICS,Photo: Li Xuanmin/GT,Author details not found,Author details not found,33,1000,<FreqDist with 17 samples and 603 outcomes>

F-35: Closer Look at Colossally Costly Jet That Just Can’t Seem to Stay Airborne,Sputnik,2023-09-21,"A US Marine Corps F-35B went down over South Carolina on Sunday after its pilot ejected mid-flight for reasons unknown. Why do F-35s seem so crash-prone? What’s wrong with them? And what role does the waste and fraud in the US military-industrial complex play in creating such a Frankenstein’s monster of an aircraft? Sputnik explores.Debris from the F-35B that went missing over South Carolina on September 17 was found in Williamsburg County, South Carolina, about two hours northeast of Joint Base Charleston on Monday following more than a day of frantic searching by the military. An as yet unspecified “mishap” was blamed for the accident. The pilot escaped unscathed.“The mishap is currently under investigation, and we are unable to provide additional details to preserve the integrity of the investigative process,” the Marine Corps said in a statement Monday. The Marines ordered a two-day global pause in all aerial operations, with the errant F-35B becoming the third major aviation-related accident suffered by the military branch in less than two months.Air units will be discussing “fundamentals of safe flight operations, ground safety, maintenance and flight procedures, and maintaining combat readiness,” the Marine Corps said.How Many F-35s Have Been Lost?Since it started being introduced into service with the Marines (2015), the US Air Force (2016), and the US Navy (2019) and began to be exported to foreign clients (starting with Israel in 2018), the F-35 has gained an unenviable reputation of being a costly, buggy, and crash-prone jet, with the F-35B that went down over South Carolina last week being at least the 11th Lightning II lost since 2018.On September 28, 2018, a US Marine Corps F-35B crashed during a flight near Marine Corps Air Station Beaufort in South Carolina, with a faulty fuel tube blamed for the incident. The pilot emerged unscathed.On April 9, 2019, a Japanese Self- Defense Force F-35A went down off Honshu, Japan. The pilot was killed after losing his bearings and suffering “special disorientation” mid-flight over the ocean.On May 19, 2020, a US Air Force F-35A from the 58th Fighter Squadron crashed while performing a landing at Eglin Air Force Base in western Florida. Pilot error (trying to land at excessive speed) and a mechanical defect related to a flight control glitch that left the plane’s tail unresponsive were blamed. The pilot survived.On September 29, 2020, a US Marine Corps F-35B was lost over Imperial County, California after colliding with a KC-130 tanker during midflight refueling. The tanker crew managed to bring their aircraft down for a hard landing. The F-35 pilot ejected successfully.On November 17, 2021, a British Royal Air Force F-35B plunged into the Mediterranean Sea after its pilot ejected during routine operations. That crash was ultimately blamed on a protective cover getting wedged into the plane’s engine intake.On January 4, 2022, a South Korean Air Force F-35A suffering from issues with its onboard avionics carried out an emergency belly landing. Investigators blamed a bird striking the warplane’s landing gear mid-flight. The pilot emerged unharmed.On January 24, 2022, a US Navy F-35C plunged into the South China Sea after making a hard landing on the USS Carl Vinson super carrier. The pilot and six sailors on the deck of the aircraft carrier were injured. A Navy investigation attributed the incident to pilot error.On October 19, 2022, another F-35, this one from the US Air Force, crashed at Hill Air Force Base in Utah during a training mission. The pilot ejected safely. It was later determined that turbulent air somehow confused the jet’s onboard avionics to the point where the aircraft became uncontrollable.On December 1, 2022, a Marine Corps F-35B collapsed on a military base in Japan after suffering a landing gear failure during training. No one was injured.Finally, on December 15, 2022, a US Navy F-35B crashed while attempting to perform a vertical landing at Naval Air Station Joint Reserve Base Fort Worth in Texas during testing of the jet’s systems. A “harmonic resonance” issue related to the jet’s Pratt & Whitney F135 engine was blamed, with the Pentagon halting further F-35 deliveries by Lockheed until an investigation was concluded.What’s Wrong With the F-35?Nearly 17 years after the F-35’s first flight, and eight years after its adoption into service, the F-35 continues to maintain a troublingly long list of technical bugs affecting both hardware and software. The aircraft, which has an astronomical total estimated purchase and sustainment price tag of over $1.7 trillion, and a per-plane cost of $70-$90 million, has faced years of harsh criticism from US officials, including former President Donald Trump at one point, who said the jet’s costs had spiraled “out of control.”At its heart, the F-35 is the product of an idea that metastasized in the Pentagon after the end of the Cold War, envisioning an all-in-one fighter platform which could be used by every branch of the military, equipped with vertical take-off and landing capability, and carry out a broad array of missions using a variety of onboard weapons. The do-it-all jet was supposed to replace nearly all of America’s fourth-gen fighter, strike, and ground attack aircraft, including the F-16 Falcon, the F/A-18 Hornet and Super Hornet, the AV-8B Harrier II, and others.The jet features just a single onboard engine – the aforementioned Pratt & Whitney F135, with engine-related troubles not only regularly referred to by watchdogs as a “leading driver” of the F-35’s problems remaining “mission capable,” but also making its operation over enemy territory or over the sea risky, since if something goes wrong, the plane doesn’t have a backup engine to limp home with.Throughout its production cycle, the F-35 Lightning II has suffered a dizzying and seemingly endless list of technical problems, from neck-snapping ejection seats to problems, ironically, while operating in stormy weather.In its 2023 report, the congressional Government Accountability Office revealed that the F-35 program “continues to experience schedule delays, cost growth, and late deliveries,” with procurement costs jumping by $13.4 billion since 2019, and modernization behind schedule and over budget.“As of January 2023, of the 821 open deficiencies, the program office characterized five of these as category 1 [i.e. critical issues which could jeopardize flight safety and security], and 816 as category 2, [i.e. those which could impede or constrain mission success].”In all, between December 2006 and 2023, the GAO has reported a whopping 277 category 1 and 2,467 category 2 deficiencies with the aircraft, among them serious issues like cabin over-pressurization, problems with the jets’ night vision systems, software bugs, radar issues, corrosion, ejection seats which could snap pilots’ necks, etc.Is a Culture of Largess to Blame?Sunday’s accident in South Carolina is the latest piece of F-35-related bad news for Lockheed Martin. In June, it was reported that the Pentagon had halted the delivery of any additional upgraded F-35s until major issues related to new Technology Refresh 3 (TR-3) hardware and weapons-related software were resolved. DoD F-35 program director Mike Schmidt told Congress in March that the risk assessment related to the TR-3 hardware upgrade wouldn’t be finished until April 2024.Despite the delays and array of technical problems, the weapons giant has continued to rack up generous contracts related to F-35 procurement and production. For example, in July, the US Navy ordered a $490 million package of equipment from Lockheed “to procure various material mod kits, special test/tooling equipment, as well as…product engineering” for already delivered, but defective planes. In August, Lockheed received another $606 million “fixed-price incentive (firm-target) undefinitized” contract “for long lead time materials, parts, components, and efforts to support of maintaining on-time production and delivery of 173 Lot 19 F-35 Joint Strike Fighter aircraft for Foreign Military Sales (FMS) customers and non-US Department of Defense (DOD) participants.”The terms of the contracts seem to be the culprit behind the F-35’s soaring costs (and Lockheed’s soaring profits, despite delivery of defective products), with so-called “cost-plus” and “undefinitized” contracts effectively making any overruns the buyer’s problem – i.e. that of US taxpayers, and of citizens of any country unfortunate enough to pen contracts for the planes from Lockheed.What About America’s Competitors?The worst part about the F-35’s troublesome history seems to be that the F-35 has already become ""obsolete"" in the sense that many of the US and NATO’s competitors have obtained the ability to defeat them, with Russia and China gaining capabilities to track and target the jets going back to the mid-to-late 2010s. In April, Iran announced that its engineers had created advanced radar technologies to not only detect F-35s, but identify the radar signature of individual F-35 planes, enabling the Islamic Republic to plan defensive operations accordingly.",WORLD,AMERICAS,Picture description not found,Author details not found,Author details not found,60,1305,<FreqDist with 18 samples and 775 outcomes>
Toxic explosion in Nebraska shows US unable to take issues affecting public security seriously: experts,Xu Yelu,2023-09-15,"Barely two months after an explosion in Louisiana, a train carrying toxic perchloric acid has exploded in a Nebraska rail yard on Thursday, prompting evacuation orders to be issued, as huge plumes are seen engulfing the city. Experts said the incident shows the US has been unable to take seriously and overcome major issues affecting public safety and the environment and ecology in the country.The incident happened on Union Pacific Railroad tracks in the city of North Platte. North Platte Volunteer Fire Department announced that they would order those living in the area to evacuate due to the toxic smoke from the railroad, according to media reports.In a post on social media platforms, it said that ""Emergency evacuation for the area between splinter and front North of railroad track due fire at the railroad involving heavy toxic smoke.""In a statement to DailyMail.com, Union Pacific Railroad said that an explosion occurred inside a container which resulted in several railcars catching fire. The railcar did not derail, the company said, and had been in the yard for several hours.Union Pacific said that one of the containers contained a hazardous chemical called perchloric acid, according to Daily Mail.Perchloric is a hazardous material used in food, drugs and biocidal products, as well as explosives, according to the report.Two months ago, a fire at a Louisiana chemical plant triggered explosions that shook homes several miles away and sent flames and smoke billowing into the air in mid-July, prompting emergency officials to urge a few hundred nearby residents to shelter indoors for several hours and to turn off their air conditioners, the Associated Press reported.Antiquated infrastructure and the outdated transportation were one factor. Another was a flawed system of governance in the US transport industry, experts noted. There is no doubt that the US has serious loopholes in the transportation management of hazardous substances, and the relevant error correction mechanism is in fact not effective, which means that this kind of thing will occur in the future, Li Haidong, a professor at the China Foreign Affairs University, told the Global Times on Friday.This shows that the US has been unable to take seriously and overcome serious and major issues affecting public safety and the environment and ecology in the country, Li said. ""It must be said that this is a great irony to the self-proclaimed internal governance of the most advanced country in the world.""Analysts said that the frequent occurrence of similar incidents shows that the error correction mechanism in the US has failed. Apart from this, racism and the proliferation of guns are also clear examples of the failure of error correction mechanisms, experts noted.",WORLD,AMERICAS,"A resident of East Palestine in the state of Ohio, US, angrily points during a town hall meeting held by the US

Greek scholar believes in ‘endless possibilities and vast land’ between China-Greece exchanges,Xu Liuliu,2023-09-14,"Chongqing, Sichuan, Shandong… Stelios Virvidakis expectantly plans his next China tour before a visit by the Global Times at his office in Athens, Greece. The University of Athens professor has grown far busier recently since he and four other Greek scholars launched the Center of Chinese and Greek Ancient Civilizations in February. Over the summer, the center has received two scholars from China who have given lectures on the history of China, and other visiting guests from places like Israel, who offered their views on Chinese medicine and its history, and a lecturer from France with insights in Chinese mathematics and how scholars in ancient China studied the living science.""Students found them to be very interesting and greatly appreciated the lectures,"" Virvidakis told the Global Times. ""Greece and China share so many similarities. So in my opinion, the horizon for our cooperation and exchanges is vast. There are endless possibilities which have not been explored.""Mutual learning Chinese President Xi Jinping replied to a letter from Virvidakis and four other Greek scholars earlier in 2023, extending congratulations over the founding of the Center of Chinese and Greek Ancient Civilizations.Hailing the long history of the Chinese civilization and profound influence of the ancient Greek civilization, Xi said in the letter that more than 2,000 years ago, the two civilizations shone brightly on the two ends of the Eurasian continent, jointly making a fundamental contribution to the evolution of human civilization.Greece's golden era produced many of its great philosophers and literary giants. The era coincided with a period in China in which ""a hundred schools of thought contended with each other"" and flourished together.As early as the 4th century BC, China was known to the Greeks by a beautiful name: Sērikḗ. In the 16th century, Euclid's Elements was introduced into China, paving the way for scientific exchanges between China and the West. The story of Prometheus narrated by Aeschylus was an inspiration to many Chinese revolutionaries. The Republic by Plato and Politics by Aristotle are also among the Greek classics known to have long made a name for themselves in China.In the eyes of Virvidakis, Chinese civilization has always been a culture that attracts people though the language is difficult. However, Chinese art, Chinese painting, Chinese poetry, especially love poems, even detective stories about China, are incredibly fascinating. Chinese director Zhang Yimou, and movies like Farewell My Concubine and Raise the Red Lantern starring Gong Li, are also very popular. Greek archaeologists who are interested in Chinese archeology want to know how China explores the past.In other art forms, the mythology and theater, ""we have tragedy, which is our own tradition. You have Chinese opera with music."" Actors and artists always want to study similarities and look at the differences, which is also the commitment of the center to promoting exchanges and mutual learning between the two civilizations and promoting the development of civilizations in various countries. China also has this appeal because people in the West think ""it's very different, it's exotic, something strange, but then they realize that it's beautiful for them."" So ""they find a lot of aspects that they have not thought about before in order to understand.""

Tiantan, a UNESCO World Heritage Site built in 1420, in Beijing Photo: VCGPhilosophy, a way of life There is a feeling among some people in the West that the Chinese system is different in some ways, said the professor. For instance,the European and American systems place great emphasis on individual rights, but China takes a more holistic approach in which ""harmony, social harmony is more important in sovereign.""""We are not exactly the same and there are also differences. But I don't believe in the so-called clash of civilizations theory that the clash is very deep and we can't live together with our differences,"" he told the Global Times. ""In fact we can live together and have peaceful exchanges. As I said, I don't think there is any danger of Greece threatening China or China occupying Greece.""In February, Virvidakis held a lecture at the center's launching ceremony, titled Philosophy is a Way of Life. Philosophy is not just theory, he said, noting that in ancient Greece and China it didn't mean just making theories about the universe, nature, god, or much of the unknown world. ""It told you how to 'organize' your life to feel happy and achieve harmony with others."" Western philosophy cannot be understood just by itself as there are also Chinese and Indian schools of philosophy among others. ""It is easier to see some similarities in ideas between Confucius and Socrates or Confucius and Aristotle,"" said Virvidakis, explaining why he is so fond of Chinese philosophy, especially Confucius thought. A simple question about what is a good life has a variety of answers in different philosophical theories.  But studying philosophy is practical and a way of life. Modern people don't just derive happiness from materialism. They need art and other emotionally stirring elements in life. In different parts and different cultures of the world,people can share similarities in emotion and sentiment.Virvidakis said that one of the most important reasons for his involving in such studies and exchanges was because ""I'm interested and I want to learn more. I'm a student too. When you are a teacher in your whole life, you're going to be a student.""",ARTS,CULTURE & LEISURE,The University of Athens Photo: VCG,"Reporter, Beijing","Global Times senior reporter, mainly covers the reporting of movies, TV, music and culture news.",43,880,<FreqDist with 16 samples and 473 outcomes>

 The first Saudi ambassador to Palestine Naif bin Bandar Al-Sudairi arrived in the West Bank on Tuesday, the official Palestinian news agency WAFA reported.Leading an official delegation, Al-Sudairi, the non-resident ambassador to Palestine and non-resident consul general in Jerusalem, presented his credentials to Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas at the presidency headquarters in Ramallah, it said.Al-Sudairi's arrival comes amid Israel's efforts to normalize relations with Saudi Arabia.During their meeting, Abbas welcomed Al-Sudairi and said his visit to Palestine and his appointment as Saudi ambassador to the State of Palestine would contribute to ""strengthening the strong fraternal relations that bind the two countries and the two brotherly peoples.""The Saudi ambassador said he hoped that his visit would be ""a successful beginning for strengthening relations in all fields,"" stressing his country's firm and supportive positions for the Palestinian people and their just cause.Earlier in the day, Al-Sudairi told reporters in a statement that ""the Arab Peace Initiative is the basic point in any upcoming agreement,"" after being asked about the fate of the initiative in the event of reaching a normalization deal between Saudi Arabia and Israel.The Arab Peace Initiative was launched in 2002 after it was drafted by Saudi Arabia and adopted by the Arab League.The initiative calls for an end to the conflict between Israel and Palestine and the normalization of relations between Israel and Arab states, in exchange for an Israeli withdrawal from the areas it gained since 1967 and proper settlement to the issue of Palestinian refugees.The Palestinians demanded the establishment of an independent state alongside Israel in all of the Palestinian territories occupied by Israel in 1967, including the entire West Bank and the Gaza Strip, with East Jerusalem as its capital.The Saudi ambassador also confirmed that his country intends to open a consulate in East Jerusalem soon.",PHOTO,WORLD,"Saudi ambassador to Palestine Naif bin Bandar Al-Sudairi (Front) arrives at the Palestinian foreign ministry headquarters in the West Bank city of Ramallah, on Sept. 26, 2023.(Photo: Xinhua)",Author details not found,Author details not found,12,313,<FreqDist with 15 samples and 181 outcomes>
China releases a white paper on its proposals and actions on building a global community of shared future,GT staff reporters,2023-09-26," The Chinese government released a white paper on Tuesday to introduce the theoretical base, practice and development of a global community of shared future, as by presenting China's vision of the course of human development, it counters the hegemonic thinking of certain countries that seek supremacy. The white paper, titled ""A Global Community of Shared Future: China's Proposals and Actions,"" introduced the background for China to raise the concept of a global community of shared future as the world is undergoing changes on a scale unseen in a century with various problems posing unprecedented challenges for human society. The zero-sum game is doomed to fail, the white paper said. But certain countries still cling to this mindset, blindly pursuing absolute security and monopolistic advantages, which will do nothing for their development in the long run but create a major threat to the world. It is increasingly obvious that the obsession with superior strength, and the zero-sum mentality are in conflict with the needs of our times, the white paper said, pointing out that the new era calls for new ideas. To build a global community of shared future is to pursue openness, inclusiveness, mutual benefit, equity and justice, the white paper said. The goal is not to replace one system or civilization with another. Instead, it is about countries with different social systems, ideologies, histories, shared rights, and shared responsibilities in global affairs. The vision of a global community of shared future stands on the right side of history and on the side of human progress. It introduces a new approach for international relations, provides new ideas for global governance, opens up new prospects for international exchanges and draws a new blueprint for a better world, according to the white paper. Such important vision transcends outdated mindsets such as zero-sum game, power politics, and Cold War confrontations. It has become the overall goal of China's major-country diplomacy in the new era, and a great banner that leads the trend of the times and the direction of human progress. The concept of a global community of shared future has deep roots in China's profound cultural heritage and its unique experience of modernization. It carries forward the diplomatic traditions of China and draws on the outstanding achievements of all other civilizations, the white paper said. It also manifests China's time-honored historical traditions, distinct characteristics of the times, and a wealth of humanistic values.  The white paper also pointed out the direction and plan to build a global community of shared future including pressing ahead with a new type of economic globalization in which countries need to pursue a policy of openness and explicitly oppose protectionism, the erection of fences and barriers, unilateral sanctions, and maximum-pressure tactics, so as to connect economies and jointly build an open world economy. Some countries are seeking to decouple from China, enclosing themselves in ""small yards, high fences,"" which will ultimately only backfire, the white paper said. Also, some people overstate the need to ""reduce dependence"" and ""de-risk,"" which is essentially creating new risks. The direction and the plan also include following a peaceful development plan, fostering a new type of international relations, practicing true multilateralism and promoting the common values of humanity. Over the past decade, China has contributed its strength to building a global community of shared future with firm conviction and solid actions. For instance, by July 2023, more than three-quarters of countries in the world and over 30 international organizations had signed agreements on Belt and Road cooperation with China. The BRI originated in China but the opportunities and achievements it creates belong to the whole world. It's an initiative for economic cooperation, not for geopolitical or military alliances, and it's open and inclusive process that neither targets nor excludes any party, the white paper said. Among those BRI projects, for example, the China-Laos Railway began operation on December 3, 2021, with 167 tunnels and 301 bridges built in 11 years along its total length of 1,035 kilometers. The railway construction created more than 110,000 local jobs, and helped build about 2,000 kilometers of roads and canals for villages along the railway, benefiting local people. Besides the BRI, the Global Development Initiative, the Global Security Initiative and Global Civilization Initiative have evolved into a crucial cornerstone for building a global community of shared future, offering China's solutions to major challenges pertaining to peace and development for humanity. Facing constant flare-ups of hotspot issues, China has been committed to fulfilling its role as a responsible major country, pushing for the resolution of international and regional flashpoints, such as the Korean Peninsula, Palestine, the Iranian nuclear issue, Syria and Afghanistan, the white paper said. On the Ukraine issue, China has actively promoted talks for peace, put forth four points, four things that the international community should do together and three observations, and released China's position on the political settlement of the Ukraine crisis and has dispatched the special representative of the Chinese government on Eurasian affairs to engage in extensive interactions and exchanges with stakeholders on the political settlement of the Ukraine crisis. Also, through the mediation of China, Saudi Arabia and Iran achieve historic reconciliation earlier this year, setting a fine example for countries in the region to resolve disputes and differences and achieve good neighborly relations through dialogue and consultation, and catalyzing a wave of reconciliation in the Middle East. China has also proposed a range of regional and bilateral initiatives on building communities of shared future and working with stakeholders to build consensus and expand cooperation, there by playing a constructive role in promoting regional peace and development. It also boosts international cooperation in fields including fighting the COVID-19 pandemic, addressing disorder in cyberspace governance and dealing with the global climate challenge. Over the past decade, the vision of a global community of shared future has gained broader support. More countries and people have come to the understanding that this vision serves the common interests of humanity, represents popular calls for peace, justice and progress, and can create the greatest synergy among all nations for building a better world, the white paper said.",CHINA,POLITICS,Photo: Li Xuanmin/GT,Author details not found,Author details not found,33,1000,<FreqDist with 17 samples and 603 outcomes>

Sputnik explores.Debris from the F-35B that went missing over South Carolina on September 17 was found in Williamsburg County, South Carolina, about two hours northeast of Joint Base Charleston on Monday following more than a day of frantic searching by the military. An as yet unspecified “mishap” was blamed for the accident. The pilot escaped unscathed.“The mishap is currently under investigation, and we are unable to provide additional details to preserve the integrity of the investigative process,” the Marine Corps said in a statement Monday. The Marines ordered a two-day global pause in all aerial operations, with the errant F-35B becoming the third major aviation-related accident suffered by the military branch in less than two months.Air units will be discussing “fundamentals of safe flight operations, ground safety, maintenance and flight procedures, and maintaining combat readiness,” the Marine Corps said.How Many F-35s Have Been Lost?Since it started being introduced into service with the Marines (2015), the US Air Force (2016), and the US Navy (2019) and began to be exported to foreign clients (starting with Israel in 2018), the F-35 has gained an unenviable reputation of being a costly, buggy, and crash-prone jet, with the F-35B that went down over South Carolina last week being at least the 11th Lightning II lost since 2018.On September 28, 2018, a US Marine Corps F-35B crashed during a flight near Marine Corps Air Station Beaufort in South Carolina, with a faulty fuel tube blamed for the incident. The pilot emerged unscathed.On April 9, 2019, a Japanese Self- Defense Force F-35A went down off Honshu, Japan. The pilot was killed after losing his bearings and suffering “special disorientation” mid-flight over the ocean.On May 19, 2020, a US Air Force F-35A from the 58th Fighter Squadron crashed while performing a landing at Eglin Air Force Base in western Florida. Pilot error (trying to land at excessive speed) and a mechanical defect related to a flight control glitch that left the plane’s tail unresponsive were blamed. The pilot survived.On September 29, 2020, a US Marine Corps F-35B was lost over Imperial County, California after colliding with a KC-130 tanker during midflight refueling. The tanker crew managed to bring their aircraft down for a hard landing. The F-35 pilot ejected successfully.On November 17, 2021, a British Royal Air Force F-35B plunged into the Mediterranean Sea after its pilot ejected during routine operations. That crash was ultimately blamed on a protective cover getting wedged into the plane’s engine intake.On January 4, 2022, a South Korean Air Force F-35A suffering from issues with its onboard avionics carried out an emergency belly landing. Investigators blamed a bird striking the warplane’s landing gear mid-flight. The pilot emerged unharmed.On January 24, 2022, a US Navy F-35C plunged into the South China Sea after making a hard landing on the USS Carl Vinson super carrier. The pilot and six sailors on the deck of the aircraft carrier were injured. A Navy investigation attributed the incident to pilot error.On October 19, 2022, another F-35, this one from the US Air Force, crashed at Hill Air Force Base in Utah during a training mission. The pilot ejected safely. It was later determined that turbulent air somehow confused the jet’s onboard avionics to the point where the aircraft became uncontrollable.On December 1, 2022, a Marine Corps F-35B collapsed on a military base in Japan after suffering a landing gear failure during training. No one was injured.Finally, on December 15, 2022, a US Navy F-35B crashed while attempting to perform a vertical landing at Naval Air Station Joint Reserve Base Fort Worth in Texas during testing of the jet’s systems. A “harmonic resonance” issue related to the jet’s Pratt & Whitney F135 engine was blamed, with the Pentagon halting further F-35 deliveries by Lockheed until an investigation was concluded.What’s Wrong With the F-35?Nearly 17 years after the F-35’s first flight, and eight years after its adoption into service, the F-35 continues to maintain a troublingly long list of technical bugs affecting both hardware and software. The aircraft, which has an astronomical total estimated purchase and sustainment price tag of over $1.7 trillion, and a per-plane cost of $70-$90 million, has faced years of harsh criticism from US officials, including former President Donald Trump at one point, who said the jet’s costs had spiraled “out of control.”At its heart, the F-35 is the product of an idea that metastasized in the Pentagon after the end of the Cold War, envisioning an all-in-one fighter platform which could be used by every branch of the military, equipped with vertical take-off and landing capability, and carry out a broad array of missions using a variety of onboard weapons. The do-it-all jet was supposed to replace nearly all of America’s fourth-gen fighter, strike, and ground attack aircraft, including the F-16 Falcon, the F/A-18 Hornet and Super Hornet, the AV-8B Harrier II, and others.The jet features just a single onboard engine – the aforementioned Pratt & Whitney F135, with engine-related troubles not only regularly referred to by watchdogs as a “leading driver” of the F-35’s problems remaining “mission capable,” but also making its operation over enemy territory or over the sea risky, since if something goes wrong, the plane doesn’t have a backup engine to limp home with.Throughout its production cycle, the F-35 Lightning II has suffered a dizzying and seemingly endless list of technical problems, from neck-snapping ejection seats to problems, ironically, while operating in stormy weather.In its 2023 report, the congressional Government Accountability Office revealed that the F-35 program “continues to experience schedule delays, cost growth, and late deliveries,” with procurement costs jumping by $13.4 billion since 2019, and modernization behind schedule and over budget.“As of January 2023, of the 821 open deficiencies, the program office characterized five of these as category 1 [i.e. critical issues which could jeopardize flight safety and security], and 816 as category 2, [i.e. those which could impede or constrain mission success].”In all, between December 2006 and 2023, the GAO has reported a whopping 277 category 1 and 2,467 category 2 deficiencies with the aircraft, among them serious issues like cabin over-pressurization, problems with the jets’ night vision systems, software bugs, radar issues, corrosion, ejection seats which could snap pilots’ necks, etc.Is a Culture of Largess to Blame?Sunday’s accident in South Carolina is the latest piece of F-35-related bad news for Lockheed Martin. In June, it was reported that the Pentagon had halted the delivery of any additional upgraded F-35s until major issues related to new Technology Refresh 3 (TR-3) hardware and weapons-related software were resolved. DoD F-35 program director Mike Schmidt told Congress in March that the risk assessment related to the TR-3 hardware upgrade wouldn’t be finished until April 2024.Despite the delays and array of technical problems, the weapons giant has continued to rack up generous contracts related to F-35 procurement and production. For example, in July, the US Navy ordered a $490 million package of equipment from Lockheed “to procure various material mod kits, special test/tooling equipment, as well as…product engineering” for already delivered, but defective planes. In August, Lockheed received another $606 million “fixed-price incentive (firm-target) undefinitized” contract “for long lead time materials, parts, components, and efforts to support of maintaining on-time production and delivery of 173 Lot 19 F-35 Joint Strike Fighter aircraft for Foreign Military Sales (FMS) customers and non-US Department of Defense (DOD) participants.”The terms of the contracts seem to be the culprit behind the F-35’s soaring costs (and Lockheed’s soaring profits, despite delivery of defective products), with so-called “cost-plus” and “undefinitized” contracts effectively making any overruns the buyer’s problem – i.e. that of US taxpayers, and of citizens of any country unfortunate enough to pen contracts for the planes from Lockheed.What About America’s Competitors?The worst part about the F-35’s troublesome history seems to be that the F-35 has already become ""obsolete"" in the sense that many of the US and NATO’s competitors have obtained the ability to defeat them, with Russia and China gaining capabilities to track and target the jets going back to the mid-to-late 2010s. In April, Iran announced that its engineers had created advanced radar technologies to not only detect F-35s, but identify the radar signature of individual F-35 planes, enabling the Islamic Republic to plan defensive operations accordingly.",WORLD,AMERICAS,Picture description not found,Author details not found,Author details not found,60,1305,<FreqDist with 18 samples and 775 outcomes>
Toxic explosion in Nebraska shows US unable to take issues affecting public security seriously: experts,Xu Yelu,2023-09-15,"Barely two months after an explosion in Louisiana, a train carrying toxic perchloric acid has exploded in a Nebraska rail yard on Thursday, prompting evacuation orders to be issued, as huge plumes are seen engulfing the city. Experts said the incident shows the US has been unable to take seriously and overcome major issues affecting public safety and the environment and ecology in the country.The incident happened on Union Pacific Railroad tracks in the city of North Platte. North Platte Volunteer Fire Department announced that they would order those living in the area to evacuate due to the toxic smoke from the railroad, according to media reports.In a post on social media platforms, it said that ""Emergency evacuation for the area between splinter and front North of railroad track due fire at the railroad involving heavy toxic smoke.""In a statement to DailyMail.com, Union Pacific Railroad said that an explosion occurred inside a container which resulted in several railcars catching fire. The railcar did not derail, the company said, and had been in the yard for several hours.Union Pacific said that one of the containers contained a hazardous chemical called perchloric acid, according to Daily Mail.Perchloric is a hazardous material used in food, drugs and biocidal products, as well as explosives, according to the report.Two months ago, a fire at a Louisiana chemical plant triggered explosions that shook homes several miles away and sent flames and smoke billowing into the air in mid-July, prompting emergency officials to urge a few hundred nearby residents to shelter indoors for several hours and to turn off their air conditioners, the Associated Press reported.Antiquated infrastructure and the outdated transportation were one factor. Another was a flawed system of governance in the US transport industry, experts noted. There is no doubt that the US has serious loopholes in the transportation management of hazardous substances, and the relevant error correction mechanism is in fact not effective, which means that this kind of thing will occur in the future, Li Haidong, a professor at the China Foreign Affairs University, told the Global Times on Friday.This shows that the US has been unable to take seriously and overcome serious and major issues affecting public safety and the environment and ecology in the country, Li said. ""It must be said that this is a great irony to the self-proclaimed internal governance of the most advanced country in the world.""Analysts said that the frequent occurrence of similar incidents shows that the error correction mechanism in the US has failed. Apart from this, racism and the proliferation of guns are also clear examples of the failure of error correction mechanisms, experts noted.",WORLD,AMERICAS,"A resident of East Palestine in the state of Ohio, US, angrily points during a town hall meeting held by the US

Greek scholar believes in ‘endless possibilities and vast land’ between China-Greece exchanges,Xu Liuliu,2023-09-14,"Chongqing, Sichuan, Shandong… Stelios Virvidakis expectantly plans his next China tour before a visit by the Global Times at his office in Athens, Greece. The University of Athens professor has grown far busier recently since he and four other Greek scholars launched the Center of Chinese and Greek Ancient Civilizations in February. Over the summer, the center has received two scholars from China who have given lectures on the history of China, and other visiting guests from places like Israel, who offered their views on Chinese medicine and its history, and a lecturer from France with insights in Chinese mathematics and how scholars in ancient China studied the living science.""Students found them to be very interesting and greatly appreciated the lectures,"" Virvidakis told the Global Times. ""Greece and China share so many similarities. So in my opinion, the horizon for our cooperation and exchanges is vast. There are endless possibilities which have not been explored.""Mutual learning Chinese President Xi Jinping replied to a letter from Virvidakis and four other Greek scholars earlier in 2023, extending congratulations over the founding of the Center of Chinese and Greek Ancient Civilizations.Hailing the long history of the Chinese civilization and profound influence of the ancient Greek civilization, Xi said in the letter that more than 2,000 years ago, the two civilizations shone brightly on the two ends of the Eurasian continent, jointly making a fundamental contribution to the evolution of human civilization.Greece's golden era produced many of its great philosophers and literary giants. The era coincided with a period in China in which ""a hundred schools of thought contended with each other"" and flourished together.As early as the 4th century BC, China was known to the Greeks by a beautiful name: Sērikḗ. In the 16th century, Euclid's Elements was introduced into China, paving the way for scientific exchanges between China and the West. The story of Prometheus narrated by Aeschylus was an inspiration to many Chinese revolutionaries. The Republic by Plato and Politics by Aristotle are also among the Greek classics known to have long made a name for themselves in China.In the eyes of Virvidakis, Chinese civilization has always been a culture that attracts people though the language is difficult. However, Chinese art, Chinese painting, Chinese poetry, especially love poems, even detective stories about China, are incredibly fascinating. Chinese director Zhang Yimou, and movies like Farewell My Concubine and Raise the Red Lantern starring Gong Li, are also very popular. Greek archaeologists who are interested in Chinese archeology want to know how China explores the past.In other art forms, the mythology and theater, ""we have tragedy, which is our own tradition. You have Chinese opera with music."" Actors and artists always want to study similarities and look at the differences, which is also the commitment of the center to promoting exchanges and mutual learning between the two civilizations and promoting the development of civilizations in various countries. China also has this appeal because people in the West think ""it's very different, it's exotic, something strange, but then they realize that it's beautiful for them."" So ""they find a lot of aspects that they have not thought about before in order to understand.""

Tiantan, a UNESCO World Heritage Site built in 1420, in Beijing Photo: VCGPhilosophy, a way of life There is a feeling among some people in the West that the Chinese system is different in some ways, said the professor. For instance,the European and American systems place great emphasis on individual rights, but China takes a more holistic approach in which ""harmony, social harmony is more important in sovereign.""""We are not exactly the same and there are also differences. But I don't believe in the so-called clash of civilizations theory that the clash is very deep and we can't live together with our differences,"" he told the Global Times. ""In fact we can live together and have peaceful exchanges. As I said, I don't think there is any danger of Greece threatening China or China occupying Greece.""In February, Virvidakis held a lecture at the center's launching ceremony, titled Philosophy is a Way of Life. Philosophy is not just theory, he said, noting that in ancient Greece and China it didn't mean just making theories about the universe, nature, god, or much of the unknown world. ""It told you how to 'organize' your life to feel happy and achieve harmony with others."" Western philosophy cannot be understood just by itself as there are also Chinese and Indian schools of philosophy among others. ""It is easier to see some similarities in ideas between Confucius and Socrates or Confucius and Aristotle,"" said Virvidakis, explaining why he is so fond of Chinese philosophy, especially Confucius thought. A simple question about what is a good life has a variety of answers in different philosophical theories.  But studying philosophy is practical and a way of life. Modern people don't just derive happiness from materialism. They need art and other emotionally stirring elements in life. In different parts and different cultures of the world,people can share similarities in emotion and sentiment.Virvidakis said that one of the most important reasons for his involving in such studies and exchanges was because ""I'm interested and I want to learn more. I'm a student too. When you are a teacher in your whole life, you're going to be a student.""",ARTS,CULTURE & LEISURE,The University of Athens Photo: VCG,"Reporter, Beijing","Global Times senior reporter, mainly covers the reporting of movies, TV, music and culture news.",43,880,<FreqDist with 16 samples and 473 outcomes>

 The first Saudi ambassador to Palestine Naif bin Bandar Al-Sudairi arrived in the West Bank on Tuesday, the official Palestinian news agency WAFA reported.Leading an official delegation, Al-Sudairi, the non-resident ambassador to Palestine and non-resident consul general in Jerusalem, presented his credentials to Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas at the presidency headquarters in Ramallah, it said.Al-Sudairi's arrival comes amid Israel's efforts to normalize relations with Saudi Arabia.During their meeting, Abbas welcomed Al-Sudairi and said his visit to Palestine and his appointment as Saudi ambassador to the State of Palestine would contribute to ""strengthening the strong fraternal relations that bind the two countries and the two brotherly peoples.""The Saudi ambassador said he hoped that his visit would be ""a successful beginning for strengthening relations in all fields,"" stressing his country's firm and supportive positions for the Palestinian people and their just cause.Earlier in the day, Al-Sudairi told reporters in a statement that ""the Arab Peace Initiative is the basic point in any upcoming agreement,"" after being asked about the fate of the initiative in the event of reaching a normalization deal between Saudi Arabia and Israel.The Arab Peace Initiative was launched in 2002 after it was drafted by Saudi Arabia and adopted by the Arab League.The initiative calls for an end to the conflict between Israel and Palestine and the normalization of relations between Israel and Arab states, in exchange for an Israeli withdrawal from the areas it gained since 1967 and proper settlement to the issue of Palestinian refugees.The Palestinians demanded the establishment of an independent state alongside Israel in all of the Palestinian territories occupied by Israel in 1967, including the entire West Bank and the Gaza Strip, with East Jerusalem as its capital.The Saudi ambassador also confirmed that his country intends to open a consulate in East Jerusalem soon.",PHOTO,WORLD,"Saudi ambassador to Palestine Naif bin Bandar Al-Sudairi (Front) arrives at the Palestinian foreign ministry headquarters in the West Bank city of Ramallah, on Sept. 26, 2023.(Photo: Xinhua)",Author details not found,Author details not found,12,313,<FreqDist with 15 samples and 181 outcomes>
China releases a white paper on its proposals and actions on building a global community of shared future,GT staff reporters,2023-09-26," The Chinese government released a white paper on Tuesday to introduce the theoretical base, practice and development of a global community of shared future, as by presenting China's vision of the course of human development, it counters the hegemonic thinking of certain countries that seek supremacy. The white paper, titled ""A Global Community of Shared Future: China's Proposals and Actions,"" introduced the background for China to raise the concept of a global community of shared future as the world is undergoing changes on a scale unseen in a century with various problems posing unprecedented challenges for human society. The zero-sum game is doomed to fail, the white paper said. But certain countries still cling to this mindset, blindly pursuing absolute security and monopolistic advantages, which will do nothing for their development in the long run but create a major threat to the world. It is increasingly obvious that the obsession with superior strength, and the zero-sum mentality are in conflict with the needs of our times, the white paper said, pointing out that the new era calls for new ideas. To build a global community of shared future is to pursue openness, inclusiveness, mutual benefit, equity and justice, the white paper said. The goal is not to replace one system or civilization with another. Instead, it is about countries with different social systems, ideologies, histories, shared rights, and shared responsibilities in global affairs. The vision of a global community of shared future stands on the right side of history and on the side of human progress. It introduces a new approach for international relations, provides new ideas for global governance, opens up new prospects for international exchanges and draws a new blueprint for a better world, according to the white paper. Such important vision transcends outdated mindsets such as zero-sum game, power politics, and Cold War confrontations. It has become the overall goal of China's major-country diplomacy in the new era, and a great banner that leads the trend of the times and the direction of human progress. The concept of a global community of shared future has deep roots in China's profound cultural heritage and its unique experience of modernization. It carries forward the diplomatic traditions of China and draws on the outstanding achievements of all other civilizations, the white paper said. It also manifests China's time-honored historical traditions, distinct characteristics of the times, and a wealth of humanistic values.  The white paper also pointed out the direction and plan to build a global community of shared future including pressing ahead with a new type of economic globalization in which countries need to pursue a policy of openness and explicitly oppose protectionism, the erection of fences and barriers, unilateral sanctions, and maximum-pressure tactics, so as to connect economies and jointly build an open world economy. Some countries are seeking to decouple from China, enclosing themselves in ""small yards, high fences,"" which will ultimately only backfire, the white paper said. Also, some people overstate the need to ""reduce dependence"" and ""de-risk,"" which is essentially creating new risks. The direction and the plan also include following a peaceful development plan, fostering a new type of international relations, practicing true multilateralism and promoting the common values of humanity. Over the past decade, China has contributed its strength to building a global community of shared future with firm conviction and solid actions. For instance, by July 2023, more than three-quarters of countries in the world and over 30 international organizations had signed agreements on Belt and Road cooperation with China. The BRI originated in China but the opportunities and achievements it creates belong to the whole world. It's an initiative for economic cooperation, not for geopolitical or military alliances, and it's open and inclusive process that neither targets nor excludes any party, the white paper said. Among those BRI projects, for example, the China-Laos Railway began operation on December 3, 2021, with 167 tunnels and 301 bridges built in 11 years along its total length of 1,035 kilometers. The railway construction created more than 110,000 local jobs, and helped build about 2,000 kilometers of roads and canals for villages along the railway, benefiting local people. Besides the BRI, the Global Development Initiative, the Global Security Initiative and Global Civilization Initiative have evolved into a crucial cornerstone for building a global community of shared future, offering China's solutions to major challenges pertaining to peace and development for humanity. Facing constant flare-ups of hotspot issues, China has been committed to fulfilling its role as a responsible major country, pushing for the resolution of international and regional flashpoints, such as the Korean Peninsula, Palestine, the Iranian nuclear issue, Syria and Afghanistan, the white paper said. On the Ukraine issue, China has actively promoted talks for peace, put forth four points, four things that the international community should do together and three observations, and released China's position on the political settlement of the Ukraine crisis and has dispatched the special representative of the Chinese government on Eurasian affairs to engage in extensive interactions and exchanges with stakeholders on the political settlement of the Ukraine crisis. Also, through the mediation of China, Saudi Arabia and Iran achieve historic reconciliation earlier this year, setting a fine example for countries in the region to resolve disputes and differences and achieve good neighborly relations through dialogue and consultation, and catalyzing a wave of reconciliation in the Middle East. China has also proposed a range of regional and bilateral initiatives on building communities of shared future and working with stakeholders to build consensus and expand cooperation, there by playing a constructive role in promoting regional peace and development. It also boosts international cooperation in fields including fighting the COVID-19 pandemic, addressing disorder in cyberspace governance and dealing with the global climate challenge. Over the past decade, the vision of a global community of shared future has gained broader support. More countries and people have come to the understanding that this vision serves the common interests of humanity, represents popular calls for peace, justice and progress, and can create the greatest synergy among all nations for building a better world, the white paper said.",CHINA,POLITICS,Photo: Li Xuanmin/GT,Author details not found,Author details not found,33,1000,<FreqDist with 17 samples and 603 outcomes>

F-35: Closer Look at Colossally Costly Jet That Just Can’t Seem to Stay Airborne,Sputnik,2023-09-21,"A US Marine Corps F-35B went down over South Carolina on Sunday after its pilot ejected mid-flight for reasons unknown. Why do F-35s seem so crash-prone? What’s wrong with them? And what role does the waste and fraud in the US military-industrial complex play in creating such a Frankenstein’s monster of an aircraft? Sputnik explores.Debris from the F-35B that went missing over South Carolina on September 17 was found in Williamsburg County, South Carolina, about two hours northeast of Joint Base Charleston on Monday following more than a day of frantic searching by the military. An as yet unspecified “mishap” was blamed for the accident. The pilot escaped unscathed.“The mishap is currently under investigation, and we are unable to provide additional details to preserve the integrity of the investigative process,” the Marine Corps said in a statement Monday. The Marines ordered a two-day global pause in all aerial operations, with the errant F-35B becoming the third major aviation-related accident suffered by the military branch in less than two months.Air units will be discussing “fundamentals of safe flight operations, ground safety, maintenance and flight procedures, and maintaining combat readiness,” the Marine Corps said.How Many F-35s Have Been Lost?Since it started being introduced into service with the Marines (2015), the US Air Force (2016), and the US Navy (2019) and began to be exported to foreign clients (starting with Israel in 2018), the F-35 has gained an unenviable reputation of being a costly, buggy, and crash-prone jet, with the F-35B that went down over South Carolina last week being at least the 11th Lightning II lost since 2018.On September 28, 2018, a US Marine Corps F-35B crashed during a flight near Marine Corps Air Station Beaufort in South Carolina, with a faulty fuel tube blamed for the incident. The pilot emerged unscathed.On April 9, 2019, a Japanese Self- Defense Force F-35A went down off Honshu, Japan. The pilot was killed after losing his bearings and suffering “special disorientation” mid-flight over the ocean.On May 19, 2020, a US Air Force F-35A from the 58th Fighter Squadron crashed while performing a landing at Eglin Air Force Base in western Florida. Pilot error (trying to land at excessive speed) and a mechanical defect related to a flight control glitch that left the plane’s tail unresponsive were blamed. The pilot survived.On September 29, 2020, a US Marine Corps F-35B was lost over Imperial County, California after colliding with a KC-130 tanker during midflight refueling. The tanker crew managed to bring their aircraft down for a hard landing. The F-35 pilot ejected successfully.On November 17, 2021, a British Royal Air Force F-35B plunged into the Mediterranean Sea after its pilot ejected during routine operations. That crash was ultimately blamed on a protective cover getting wedged into the plane’s engine intake.On January 4, 2022, a South Korean Air Force F-35A suffering from issues with its onboard avionics carried out an emergency belly landing. Investigators blamed a bird striking the warplane’s landing gear mid-flight. The pilot emerged unharmed.On January 24, 2022, a US Navy F-35C plunged into the South China Sea after making a hard landing on the USS Carl Vinson super carrier. The pilot and six sailors on the deck of the aircraft carrier were injured. A Navy investigation attributed the incident to pilot error.On October 19, 2022, another F-35, this one from the US Air Force, crashed at Hill Air Force Base in Utah during a training mission. The pilot ejected safely. It was later determined that turbulent air somehow confused the jet’s onboard avionics to the point where the aircraft became uncontrollable.On December 1, 2022, a Marine Corps F-35B collapsed on a military base in Japan after suffering a landing gear failure during training. No one was injured.Finally, on December 15, 2022, a US Navy F-35B crashed while attempting to perform a vertical landing at Naval Air Station Joint Reserve Base Fort Worth in Texas during testing of the jet’s systems. A “harmonic resonance” issue related to the jet’s Pratt & Whitney F135 engine was blamed, with the Pentagon halting further F-35 deliveries by Lockheed until an investigation was concluded.What’s Wrong With the F-35?Nearly 17 years after the F-35’s first flight, and eight years after its adoption into service, the F-35 continues to maintain a troublingly long list of technical bugs affecting both hardware and software. The aircraft, which has an astronomical total estimated purchase and sustainment price tag of over $1.7 trillion, and a per-plane cost of $70-$90 million, has faced years of harsh criticism from US officials, including former President Donald Trump at one point, who said the jet’s costs had spiraled “out of control.”At its heart, the F-35 is the product of an idea that metastasized in the Pentagon after the end of the Cold War, envisioning an all-in-one fighter platform which could be used by every branch of the military, equipped with vertical take-off and landing capability, and carry out a broad array of missions using a variety of onboard weapons. The do-it-all jet was supposed to replace nearly all of America’s fourth-gen fighter, strike, and ground attack aircraft, including the F-16 Falcon, the F/A-18 Hornet and Super Hornet, the AV-8B Harrier II, and others.The jet features just a single onboard engine – the aforementioned Pratt & Whitney F135, with engine-related troubles not only regularly referred to by watchdogs as a “leading driver” of the F-35’s problems remaining “mission capable,” but also making its operation over enemy territory or over the sea risky, since if something goes wrong, the plane doesn’t have a backup engine to limp home with.Throughout its production cycle, the F-35 Lightning II has suffered a dizzying and seemingly endless list of technical problems, from neck-snapping ejection seats to problems, ironically, while operating in stormy weather.In its 2023 report, the congressional Government Accountability Office revealed that the F-35 program “continues to experience schedule delays, cost growth, and late deliveries,” with procurement costs jumping by $13.4 billion since 2019, and modernization behind schedule and over budget.“As of January 2023, of the 821 open deficiencies, the program office characterized five of these as category 1 [i.e. critical issues which could jeopardize flight safety and security], and 816 as category 2, [i.e. those which could impede or constrain mission success].”In all, between December 2006 and 2023, the GAO has reported a whopping 277 category 1 and 2,467 category 2 deficiencies with the aircraft, among them serious issues like cabin over-pressurization, problems with the jets’ night vision systems, software bugs, radar issues, corrosion, ejection seats which could snap pilots’ necks, etc.Is a Culture of Largess to Blame?Sunday’s accident in South Carolina is the latest piece of F-35-related bad news for Lockheed Martin. In June, it was reported that the Pentagon had halted the delivery of any additional upgraded F-35s until major issues related to new Technology Refresh 3 (TR-3) hardware and weapons-related software were resolved. DoD F-35 program director Mike Schmidt told Congress in March that the risk assessment related to the TR-3 hardware upgrade wouldn’t be finished until April 2024.Despite the delays and array of technical problems, the weapons giant has continued to rack up generous contracts related to F-35 procurement and production. For example, in July, the US Navy ordered a $490 million package of equipment from Lockheed “to procure various material mod kits, special test/tooling equipment, as well as…product engineering” for already delivered, but defective planes. In August, Lockheed received another $606 million “fixed-price incentive (firm-target) undefinitized” contract “for long lead time materials, parts, components, and efforts to support of maintaining on-time production and delivery of 173 Lot 19 F-35 Joint Strike Fighter aircraft for Foreign Military Sales (FMS) customers and non-US Department of Defense (DOD) participants.”The terms of the contracts seem to be the culprit behind the F-35’s soaring costs (and Lockheed’s soaring profits, despite delivery of defective products), with so-called “cost-plus” and “undefinitized” contracts effectively making any overruns the buyer’s problem – i.e. that of US taxpayers, and of citizens of any country unfortunate enough to pen contracts for the planes from Lockheed.What About America’s Competitors?The worst part about the F-35’s troublesome history seems to be that the F-35 has already become ""obsolete"" in the sense that many of the US and NATO’s competitors have obtained the ability to defeat them, with Russia and China gaining capabilities to track and target the jets going back to the mid-to-late 2010s. In April, Iran announced that its engineers had created advanced radar technologies to not only detect F-35s, but identify the radar signature of individual F-35 planes, enabling the Islamic Republic to plan defensive operations accordingly.",WORLD,AMERICAS,Picture description not found,Author details not found,Author details not found,60,1305,<FreqDist with 18 samples and 775 outcomes>
Toxic explosion in Nebraska shows US unable to take issues affecting public security seriously: experts,Xu Yelu,2023-09-15,"Barely two months after an explosion in Louisiana, a train carrying toxic perchloric acid has exploded in a Nebraska rail yard on Thursday, prompting evacuation orders to be issued, as huge plumes are seen engulfing the city. Experts said the incident shows the US has been unable to take seriously and overcome major issues affecting public safety and the environment and ecology in the country.The incident happened on Union Pacific Railroad tracks in the city of North Platte. North Platte Volunteer Fire Department announced that they would order those living in the area to evacuate due to the toxic smoke from the railroad, according to media reports.In a post on social media platforms, it said that ""Emergency evacuation for the area between splinter and front North of railroad track due fire at the railroad involving heavy toxic smoke.""In a statement to DailyMail.com, Union Pacific Railroad said that an explosion occurred inside a container which resulted in several railcars catching fire. The railcar did not derail, the company said, and had been in the yard for several hours.Union Pacific said that one of the containers contained a hazardous chemical called perchloric acid, according to Daily Mail.Perchloric is a hazardous material used in food, drugs and biocidal products, as well as explosives, according to the report.Two months ago, a fire at a Louisiana chemical plant triggered explosions that shook homes several miles away and sent flames and smoke billowing into the air in mid-July, prompting emergency officials to urge a few hundred nearby residents to shelter indoors for several hours and to turn off their air conditioners, the Associated Press reported.Antiquated infrastructure and the outdated transportation were one factor. Another was a flawed system of governance in the US transport industry, experts noted. There is no doubt that the US has serious loopholes in the transportation management of hazardous substances, and the relevant error correction mechanism is in fact not effective, which means that this kind of thing will occur in the future, Li Haidong, a professor at the China Foreign Affairs University, told the Global Times on Friday.This shows that the US has been unable to take seriously and overcome serious and major issues affecting public safety and the environment and ecology in the country, Li said. ""It must be said that this is a great irony to the self-proclaimed internal governance of the most advanced country in the world.""Analysts said that the frequent occurrence of similar incidents shows that the error correction mechanism in the US has failed. Apart from this, racism and the proliferation of guns are also clear examples of the failure of error correction mechanisms, experts noted.",WORLD,AMERICAS,"A resident of East Palestine in the state of Ohio, US, angrily points during a town hall meeting held by the US

Greek scholar believes in ‘endless possibilities and vast land’ between China-Greece exchanges,Xu Liuliu,2023-09-14,"Chongqing, Sichuan, Shandong… Stelios Virvidakis expectantly plans his next China tour before a visit by the Global Times at his office in Athens, Greece. The University of Athens professor has grown far busier recently since he and four other Greek scholars launched the Center of Chinese and Greek Ancient Civilizations in February. Over the summer, the center has received two scholars from China who have given lectures on the history of China, and other visiting guests from places like Israel, who offered their views on Chinese medicine and its history, and a lecturer from France with insights in Chinese mathematics and how scholars in ancient China studied the living science.""Students found them to be very interesting and greatly appreciated the lectures,"" Virvidakis told the Global Times. ""Greece and China share so many similarities. So in my opinion, the horizon for our cooperation and exchanges is vast. There are endless possibilities which have not been explored.""Mutual learning Chinese President Xi Jinping replied to a letter from Virvidakis and four other Greek scholars earlier in 2023, extending congratulations over the founding of the Center of Chinese and Greek Ancient Civilizations.Hailing the long history of the Chinese civilization and profound influence of the ancient Greek civilization, Xi said in the letter that more than 2,000 years ago, the two civilizations shone brightly on the two ends of the Eurasian continent, jointly making a fundamental contribution to the evolution of human civilization.Greece's golden era produced many of its great philosophers and literary giants. The era coincided with a period in China in which ""a hundred schools of thought contended with each other"" and flourished together.As early as the 4th century BC, China was known to the Greeks by a beautiful name: Sērikḗ. In the 16th century, Euclid's Elements was introduced into China, paving the way for scientific exchanges between China and the West. The story of Prometheus narrated by Aeschylus was an inspiration to many Chinese revolutionaries. The Republic by Plato and Politics by Aristotle are also among the Greek classics known to have long made a name for themselves in China.In the eyes of Virvidakis, Chinese civilization has always been a culture that attracts people though the language is difficult. However, Chinese art, Chinese painting, Chinese poetry, especially love poems, even detective stories about China, are incredibly fascinating. Chinese director Zhang Yimou, and movies like Farewell My Concubine and Raise the Red Lantern starring Gong Li, are also very popular. Greek archaeologists who are interested in Chinese archeology want to know how China explores the past.In other art forms, the mythology and theater, ""we have tragedy, which is our own tradition. You have Chinese opera with music."" Actors and artists always want to study similarities and look at the differences, which is also the commitment of the center to promoting exchanges and mutual learning between the two civilizations and promoting the development of civilizations in various countries. China also has this appeal because people in the West think ""it's very different, it's exotic, something strange, but then they realize that it's beautiful for them."" So ""they find a lot of aspects that they have not thought about before in order to understand.""

Tiantan, a UNESCO World Heritage Site built in 1420, in Beijing Photo: VCGPhilosophy, a way of life There is a feeling among some people in the West that the Chinese system is different in some ways, said the professor. For instance,the European and American systems place great emphasis on individual rights, but China takes a more holistic approach in which ""harmony, social harmony is more important in sovereign.""""We are not exactly the same and there are also differences. But I don't believe in the so-called clash of civilizations theory that the clash is very deep and we can't live together with our differences,"" he told the Global Times. ""In fact we can live together and have peaceful exchanges. As I said, I don't think there is any danger of Greece threatening China or China occupying Greece.""In February, Virvidakis held a lecture at the center's launching ceremony, titled Philosophy is a Way of Life. Philosophy is not just theory, he said, noting that in ancient Greece and China it didn't mean just making theories about the universe, nature, god, or much of the unknown world. ""It told you how to 'organize' your life to feel happy and achieve harmony with others."" Western philosophy cannot be understood just by itself as there are also Chinese and Indian schools of philosophy among others. ""It is easier to see some similarities in ideas between Confucius and Socrates or Confucius and Aristotle,"" said Virvidakis, explaining why he is so fond of Chinese philosophy, especially Confucius thought. A simple question about what is a good life has a variety of answers in different philosophical theories.  But studying philosophy is practical and a way of life. Modern people don't just derive happiness from materialism. They need art and other emotionally stirring elements in life. In different parts and different cultures of the world,people can share similarities in emotion and sentiment.Virvidakis said that one of the most important reasons for his involving in such studies and exchanges was because ""I'm interested and I want to learn more. I'm a student too. When you are a teacher in your whole life, you're going to be a student.""",ARTS,CULTURE & LEISURE,The University of Athens Photo: VCG,"Reporter, Beijing","Global Times senior reporter, mainly covers the reporting of movies, TV, music and culture news.",43,880,<FreqDist with 16 samples and 473 outcomes>

 The first Saudi ambassador to Palestine Naif bin Bandar Al-Sudairi arrived in the West Bank on Tuesday, the official Palestinian news agency WAFA reported.Leading an official delegation, Al-Sudairi, the non-resident ambassador to Palestine and non-resident consul general in Jerusalem, presented his credentials to Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas at the presidency headquarters in Ramallah, it said.Al-Sudairi's arrival comes amid Israel's efforts to normalize relations with Saudi Arabia.During their meeting, Abbas welcomed Al-Sudairi and said his visit to Palestine and his appointment as Saudi ambassador to the State of Palestine would contribute to ""strengthening the strong fraternal relations that bind the two countries and the two brotherly peoples.""The Saudi ambassador said he hoped that his visit would be ""a successful beginning for strengthening relations in all fields,"" stressing his country's firm and supportive positions for the Palestinian people and their just cause.Earlier in the day, Al-Sudairi told reporters in a statement that ""the Arab Peace Initiative is the basic point in any upcoming agreement,"" after being asked about the fate of the initiative in the event of reaching a normalization deal between Saudi Arabia and Israel.The Arab Peace Initiative was launched in 2002 after it was drafted by Saudi Arabia and adopted by the Arab League.The initiative calls for an end to the conflict between Israel and Palestine and the normalization of relations between Israel and Arab states, in exchange for an Israeli withdrawal from the areas it gained since 1967 and proper settlement to the issue of Palestinian refugees.The Palestinians demanded the establishment of an independent state alongside Israel in all of the Palestinian territories occupied by Israel in 1967, including the entire West Bank and the Gaza Strip, with East Jerusalem as its capital.The Saudi ambassador also confirmed that his country intends to open a consulate in East Jerusalem soon.",PHOTO,WORLD,"Saudi ambassador to Palestine Naif bin Bandar Al-Sudairi (Front) arrives at the Palestinian foreign ministry headquarters in the West Bank city of Ramallah, on Sept. 26, 2023.(Photo: Xinhua)",Author details not found,Author details not found,12,313,<FreqDist with 15 samples and 181 outcomes>
China releases a white paper on its proposals and actions on building a global community of shared future,GT staff reporters,2023-09-26," The Chinese government released a white paper on Tuesday to introduce the theoretical base, practice and development of a global community of shared future, as by presenting China's vision of the course of human development, it counters the hegemonic thinking of certain countries that seek supremacy. The white paper, titled ""A Global Community of Shared Future: China's Proposals and Actions,"" introduced the background for China to raise the concept of a global community of shared future as the world is undergoing changes on a scale unseen in a century with various problems posing unprecedented challenges for human society. The zero-sum game is doomed to fail, the white paper said. But certain countries still cling to this mindset, blindly pursuing absolute security and monopolistic advantages, which will do nothing for their development in the long run but create a major threat to the world. It is increasingly obvious that the obsession with superior strength, and the zero-sum mentality are in conflict with the needs of our times, the white paper said, pointing out that the new era calls for new ideas. To build a global community of shared future is to pursue openness, inclusiveness, mutual benefit, equity and justice, the white paper said. The goal is not to replace one system or civilization with another. Instead, it is about countries with different social systems, ideologies, histories, shared rights, and shared responsibilities in global affairs. The vision of a global community of shared future stands on the right side of history and on the side of human progress. It introduces a new approach for international relations, provides new ideas for global governance, opens up new prospects for international exchanges and draws a new blueprint for a better world, according to the white paper. Such important vision transcends outdated mindsets such as zero-sum game, power politics, and Cold War confrontations. It has become the overall goal of China's major-country diplomacy in the new era, and a great banner that leads the trend of the times and the direction of human progress. The concept of a global community of shared future has deep roots in China's profound cultural heritage and its unique experience of modernization. It carries forward the diplomatic traditions of China and draws on the outstanding achievements of all other civilizations, the white paper said. It also manifests China's time-honored historical traditions, distinct characteristics of the times, and a wealth of humanistic values.  The white paper also pointed out the direction and plan to build a global community of shared future including pressing ahead with a new type of economic globalization in which countries need to pursue a policy of openness and explicitly oppose protectionism, the erection of fences and barriers, unilateral sanctions, and maximum-pressure tactics, so as to connect economies and jointly build an open world economy. Some countries are seeking to decouple from China, enclosing themselves in ""small yards, high fences,"" which will ultimately only backfire, the white paper said. Also, some people overstate the need to ""reduce dependence"" and ""de-risk,"" which is essentially creating new risks. The direction and the plan also include following a peaceful development plan, fostering a new type of international relations, practicing true multilateralism and promoting the common values of humanity. Over the past decade, China has contributed its strength to building a global community of shared future with firm conviction and solid actions. For instance, by July 2023, more than three-quarters of countries in the world and over 30 international organizations had signed agreements on Belt and Road cooperation with China. The BRI originated in China but the opportunities and achievements it creates belong to the whole world. It's an initiative for economic cooperation, not for geopolitical or military alliances, and it's open and inclusive process that neither targets nor excludes any party, the white paper said. Among those BRI projects, for example, the China-Laos Railway began operation on December 3, 2021, with 167 tunnels and 301 bridges built in 11 years along its total length of 1,035 kilometers. The railway construction created more than 110,000 local jobs, and helped build about 2,000 kilometers of roads and canals for villages along the railway, benefiting local people. Besides the BRI, the Global Development Initiative, the Global Security Initiative and Global Civilization Initiative have evolved into a crucial cornerstone for building a global community of shared future, offering China's solutions to major challenges pertaining to peace and development for humanity. Facing constant flare-ups of hotspot issues, China has been committed to fulfilling its role as a responsible major country, pushing for the resolution of international and regional flashpoints, such as the Korean Peninsula, Palestine, the Iranian nuclear issue, Syria and Afghanistan, the white paper said. On the Ukraine issue, China has actively promoted talks for peace, put forth four points, four things that the international community should do together and three observations, and released China's position on the political settlement of the Ukraine crisis and has dispatched the special representative of the Chinese government on Eurasian affairs to engage in extensive interactions and exchanges with stakeholders on the political settlement of the Ukraine crisis. Also, through the mediation of China, Saudi Arabia and Iran achieve historic reconciliation earlier this year, setting a fine example for countries in the region to resolve disputes and differences and achieve good neighborly relations through dialogue and consultation, and catalyzing a wave of reconciliation in the Middle East. China has also proposed a range of regional and bilateral initiatives on building communities of shared future and working with stakeholders to build consensus and expand cooperation, there by playing a constructive role in promoting regional peace and development. It also boosts international cooperation in fields including fighting the COVID-19 pandemic, addressing disorder in cyberspace governance and dealing with the global climate challenge. Over the past decade, the vision of a global community of shared future has gained broader support. More countries and people have come to the understanding that this vision serves the common interests of humanity, represents popular calls for peace, justice and progress, and can create the greatest synergy among all nations for building a better world, the white paper said.",CHINA,POLITICS,Photo: Li Xuanmin/GT,Author details not found,Author details not found,33,1000,<FreqDist with 17 samples and 603 outcomes>

F-35: Closer Look at Colossally Costly Jet That Just Can’t Seem to Stay Airborne,Sputnik,2023-09-21,"A US Marine Corps F-35B went down over South Carolina on Sunday after its pilot ejected mid-flight for reasons unknown. Why do F-35s seem so crash-prone? What’s wrong with them? And what role does the waste and fraud in the US military-industrial complex play in creating such a Frankenstein’s monster of an aircraft? Sputnik explores.Debris from the F-35B that went missing over South Carolina on September 17 was found in Williamsburg County, South Carolina, about two hours northeast of Joint Base Charleston on Monday following more than a day of frantic searching by the military. An as yet unspecified “mishap” was blamed for the accident. The pilot escaped unscathed.“The mishap is currently under investigation, and we are unable to provide additional details to preserve the integrity of the investigative process,” the Marine Corps said in a statement Monday. The Marines ordered a two-day global pause in all aerial operations, with the errant F-35B becoming the third major aviation-related accident suffered by the military branch in less than two months.Air units will be discussing “fundamentals of safe flight operations, ground safety, maintenance and flight procedures, and maintaining combat readiness,” the Marine Corps said.How Many F-35s Have Been Lost?Since it started being introduced into service with the Marines (2015), the US Air Force (2016), and the US Navy (2019) and began to be exported to foreign clients (starting with Israel in 2018), the F-35 has gained an unenviable reputation of being a costly, buggy, and crash-prone jet, with the F-35B that went down over South Carolina last week being at least the 11th Lightning II lost since 2018.On September 28, 2018, a US Marine Corps F-35B crashed during a flight near Marine Corps Air Station Beaufort in South Carolina, with a faulty fuel tube blamed for the incident. The pilot emerged unscathed.On April 9, 2019, a Japanese Self- Defense Force F-35A went down off Honshu, Japan. The pilot was killed after losing his bearings and suffering “special disorientation” mid-flight over the ocean.On May 19, 2020, a US Air Force F-35A from the 58th Fighter Squadron crashed while performing a landing at Eglin Air Force Base in western Florida. Pilot error (trying to land at excessive speed) and a mechanical defect related to a flight control glitch that left the plane’s tail unresponsive were blamed. The pilot survived.On September 29, 2020, a US Marine Corps F-35B was lost over Imperial County, California after colliding with a KC-130 tanker during midflight refueling. The tanker crew managed to bring their aircraft down for a hard landing. The F-35 pilot ejected successfully.On November 17, 2021, a British Royal Air Force F-35B plunged into the Mediterranean Sea after its pilot ejected during routine operations. That crash was ultimately blamed on a protective cover getting wedged into the plane’s engine intake.On January 4, 2022, a South Korean Air Force F-35A suffering from issues with its onboard avionics carried out an emergency belly landing. Investigators blamed a bird striking the warplane’s landing gear mid-flight. The pilot emerged unharmed.On January 24, 2022, a US Navy F-35C plunged into the South China Sea after making a hard landing on the USS Carl Vinson super carrier. The pilot and six sailors on the deck of the aircraft carrier were injured. A Navy investigation attributed the incident to pilot error.On October 19, 2022, another F-35, this one from the US Air Force, crashed at Hill Air Force Base in Utah during a training mission. The pilot ejected safely. It was later determined that turbulent air somehow confused the jet’s onboard avionics to the point where the aircraft became uncontrollable.On December 1, 2022, a Marine Corps F-35B collapsed on a military base in Japan after suffering a landing gear failure during training. No one was injured.Finally, on December 15, 2022, a US Navy F-35B crashed while attempting to perform a vertical landing at Naval Air Station Joint Reserve Base Fort Worth in Texas during testing of the jet’s systems. A “harmonic resonance” issue related to the jet’s Pratt & Whitney F135 engine was blamed, with the Pentagon halting further F-35 deliveries by Lockheed until an investigation was concluded.What’s Wrong With the F-35?Nearly 17 years after the F-35’s first flight, and eight years after its adoption into service, the F-35 continues to maintain a troublingly long list of technical bugs affecting both hardware and software. The aircraft, which has an astronomical total estimated purchase and sustainment price tag of over $1.7 trillion, and a per-plane cost of $70-$90 million, has faced years of harsh criticism from US officials, including former President Donald Trump at one point, who said the jet’s costs had spiraled “out of control.”At its heart, the F-35 is the product of an idea that metastasized in the Pentagon after the end of the Cold War, envisioning an all-in-one fighter platform which could be used by every branch of the military, equipped with vertical take-off and landing capability, and carry out a broad array of missions using a variety of onboard weapons. The do-it-all jet was supposed to replace nearly all of America’s fourth-gen fighter, strike, and ground attack aircraft, including the F-16 Falcon, the F/A-18 Hornet and Super Hornet, the AV-8B Harrier II, and others.The jet features just a single onboard engine – the aforementioned Pratt & Whitney F135, with engine-related troubles not only regularly referred to by watchdogs as a “leading driver” of the F-35’s problems remaining “mission capable,” but also making its operation over enemy territory or over the sea risky, since if something goes wrong, the plane doesn’t have a backup engine to limp home with.Throughout its production cycle, the F-35 Lightning II has suffered a dizzying and seemingly endless list of technical problems, from neck-snapping ejection seats to problems, ironically, while operating in stormy weather.In its 2023 report, the congressional Government Accountability Office revealed that the F-35 program “continues to experience schedule delays, cost growth, and late deliveries,” with procurement costs jumping by $13.4 billion since 2019, and modernization behind schedule and over budget.“As of January 2023, of the 821 open deficiencies, the program office characterized five of these as category 1 [i.e. critical issues which could jeopardize flight safety and security], and 816 as category 2, [i.e. those which could impede or constrain mission success].”In all, between December 2006 and 2023, the GAO has reported a whopping 277 category 1 and 2,467 category 2 deficiencies with the aircraft, among them serious issues like cabin over-pressurization, problems with the jets’ night vision systems, software bugs, radar issues, corrosion, ejection seats which could snap pilots’ necks, etc.Is a Culture of Largess to Blame?Sunday’s accident in South Carolina is the latest piece of F-35-related bad news for Lockheed Martin. In June, it was reported that the Pentagon had halted the delivery of any additional upgraded F-35s until major issues related to new Technology Refresh 3 (TR-3) hardware and weapons-related software were resolved. DoD F-35 program director Mike Schmidt told Congress in March that the risk assessment related to the TR-3 hardware upgrade wouldn’t be finished until April 2024.Despite the delays and array of technical problems, the weapons giant has continued to rack up generous contracts related to F-35 procurement and production. For example, in July, the US Navy ordered a $490 million package of equipment from Lockheed “to procure various material mod kits, special test/tooling equipment, as well as…product engineering” for already delivered, but defective planes. In August, Lockheed received another $606 million “fixed-price incentive (firm-target) undefinitized” contract “for long lead time materials, parts, components, and efforts to support of maintaining on-time production and delivery of 173 Lot 19 F-35 Joint Strike Fighter aircraft for Foreign Military Sales (FMS) customers and non-US Department of Defense (DOD) participants.”The terms of the contracts seem to be the culprit behind the F-35’s soaring costs (and Lockheed’s soaring profits, despite delivery of defective products), with so-called “cost-plus” and “undefinitized” contracts effectively making any overruns the buyer’s problem – i.e. that of US taxpayers, and of citizens of any country unfortunate enough to pen contracts for the planes from Lockheed.What About America’s Competitors?The worst part about the F-35’s troublesome history seems to be that the F-35 has already become ""obsolete"" in the sense that many of the US and NATO’s competitors have obtained the ability to defeat them, with Russia and China gaining capabilities to track and target the jets going back to the mid-to-late 2010s. In April, Iran announced that its engineers had created advanced radar technologies to not only detect F-35s, but identify the radar signature of individual F-35 planes, enabling the Islamic Republic to plan defensive operations accordingly.",WORLD,AMERICAS,Picture description not found,Author details not found,Author details not found,60,1305,<FreqDist with 18 samples and 775 outcomes>
Toxic explosion in Nebraska shows US unable to take issues affecting public security seriously: experts,Xu Yelu,2023-09-15,"Barely two months after an explosion in Louisiana, a train carrying toxic perchloric acid has exploded in a Nebraska rail yard on Thursday, prompting evacuation orders to be issued, as huge plumes are seen engulfing the city. Experts said the incident shows the US has been unable to take seriously and overcome major issues affecting public safety and the environment and ecology in the country.The incident happened on Union Pacific Railroad tracks in the city of North Platte. North Platte Volunteer Fire Department announced that they would order those living in the area to evacuate due to the toxic smoke from the railroad, according to media reports.In a post on social media platforms, it said that ""Emergency evacuation for the area between splinter and front North of railroad track due fire at the railroad involving heavy toxic smoke.""In a statement to DailyMail.com, Union Pacific Railroad said that an explosion occurred inside a container which resulted in several railcars catching fire. The railcar did not derail, the company said, and had been in the yard for several hours.Union Pacific said that one of the containers contained a hazardous chemical called perchloric acid, according to Daily Mail.Perchloric is a hazardous material used in food, drugs and biocidal products, as well as explosives, according to the report.Two months ago, a fire at a Louisiana chemical plant triggered explosions that shook homes several miles away and sent flames and smoke billowing into the air in mid-July, prompting emergency officials to urge a few hundred nearby residents to shelter indoors for several hours and to turn off their air conditioners, the Associated Press reported.Antiquated infrastructure and the outdated transportation were one factor. Another was a flawed system of governance in the US transport industry, experts noted. There is no doubt that the US has serious loopholes in the transportation management of hazardous substances, and the relevant error correction mechanism is in fact not effective, which means that this kind of thing will occur in the future, Li Haidong, a professor at the China Foreign Affairs University, told the Global Times on Friday.This shows that the US has been unable to take seriously and overcome serious and major issues affecting public safety and the environment and ecology in the country, Li said. ""It must be said that this is a great irony to the self-proclaimed internal governance of the most advanced country in the world.""Analysts said that the frequent occurrence of similar incidents shows that the error correction mechanism in the US has failed. Apart from this, racism and the proliferation of guns are also clear examples of the failure of error correction mechanisms, experts noted.",WORLD,AMERICAS,"A resident of East Palestine in the state of Ohio, US, angrily points during a town hall meeting held by the US

Greek scholar believes in ‘endless possibilities and vast land’ between China-Greece exchanges,Xu Liuliu,2023-09-14,"Chongqing, Sichuan, Shandong… Stelios Virvidakis expectantly plans his next China tour before a visit by the Global Times at his office in Athens, Greece. The University of Athens professor has grown far busier recently since he and four other Greek scholars launched the Center of Chinese and Greek Ancient Civilizations in February. Over the summer, the center has received two scholars from China who have given lectures on the history of China, and other visiting guests from places like Israel, who offered their views on Chinese medicine and its history, and a lecturer from France with insights in Chinese mathematics and how scholars in ancient China studied the living science.""Students found them to be very interesting and greatly appreciated the lectures,"" Virvidakis told the Global Times. ""Greece and China share so many similarities. So in my opinion, the horizon for our cooperation and exchanges is vast. There are endless possibilities which have not been explored.""Mutual learning Chinese President Xi Jinping replied to a letter from Virvidakis and four other Greek scholars earlier in 2023, extending congratulations over the founding of the Center of Chinese and Greek Ancient Civilizations.Hailing the long history of the Chinese civilization and profound influence of the ancient Greek civilization, Xi said in the letter that more than 2,000 years ago, the two civilizations shone brightly on the two ends of the Eurasian continent, jointly making a fundamental contribution to the evolution of human civilization.Greece's golden era produced many of its great philosophers and literary giants. The era coincided with a period in China in which ""a hundred schools of thought contended with each other"" and flourished together.As early as the 4th century BC, China was known to the Greeks by a beautiful name: Sērikḗ. In the 16th century, Euclid's Elements was introduced into China, paving the way for scientific exchanges between China and the West. The story of Prometheus narrated by Aeschylus was an inspiration to many Chinese revolutionaries. The Republic by Plato and Politics by Aristotle are also among the Greek classics known to have long made a name for themselves in China.In the eyes of Virvidakis, Chinese civilization has always been a culture that attracts people though the language is difficult. However, Chinese art, Chinese painting, Chinese poetry, especially love poems, even detective stories about China, are incredibly fascinating. Chinese director Zhang Yimou, and movies like Farewell My Concubine and Raise the Red Lantern starring Gong Li, are also very popular. Greek archaeologists who are interested in Chinese archeology want to know how China explores the past.In other art forms, the mythology and theater, ""we have tragedy, which is our own tradition. You have Chinese opera with music."" Actors and artists always want to study similarities and look at the differences, which is also the commitment of the center to promoting exchanges and mutual learning between the two civilizations and promoting the development of civilizations in various countries. China also has this appeal because people in the West think ""it's very different, it's exotic, something strange, but then they realize that it's beautiful for them."" So ""they find a lot of aspects that they have not thought about before in order to understand.""

Tiantan, a UNESCO World Heritage Site built in 1420, in Beijing Photo: VCGPhilosophy, a way of life There is a feeling among some people in the West that the Chinese system is different in some ways, said the professor. For instance,the European and American systems place great emphasis on individual rights, but China takes a more holistic approach in which ""harmony, social harmony is more important in sovereign.""""We are not exactly the same and there are also differences. But I don't believe in the so-called clash of civilizations theory that the clash is very deep and we can't live together with our differences,"" he told the Global Times. ""In fact we can live together and have peaceful exchanges. As I said, I don't think there is any danger of Greece threatening China or China occupying Greece.""In February, Virvidakis held a lecture at the center's launching ceremony, titled Philosophy is a Way of Life. Philosophy is not just theory, he said, noting that in ancient Greece and China it didn't mean just making theories about the universe, nature, god, or much of the unknown world. ""It told you how to 'organize' your life to feel happy and achieve harmony with others."" Western philosophy cannot be understood just by itself as there are also Chinese and Indian schools of philosophy among others. ""It is easier to see some similarities in ideas between Confucius and Socrates or Confucius and Aristotle,"" said Virvidakis, explaining why he is so fond of Chinese philosophy, especially Confucius thought. A simple question about what is a good life has a variety of answers in different philosophical theories.  But studying philosophy is practical and a way of life. Modern people don't just derive happiness from materialism. They need art and other emotionally stirring elements in life. In different parts and different cultures of the world,people can share similarities in emotion and sentiment.Virvidakis said that one of the most important reasons for his involving in such studies and exchanges was because ""I'm interested and I want to learn more. I'm a student too. When you are a teacher in your whole life, you're going to be a student.""",ARTS,CULTURE & LEISURE,The University of Athens Photo: VCG,"Reporter, Beijing","Global Times senior reporter, mainly covers the reporting of movies, TV, music and culture news.",43,880,<FreqDist with 16 samples and 473 outcomes>

 The first Saudi ambassador to Palestine Naif bin Bandar Al-Sudairi arrived in the West Bank on Tuesday, the official Palestinian news agency WAFA reported.Leading an official delegation, Al-Sudairi, the non-resident ambassador to Palestine and non-resident consul general in Jerusalem, presented his credentials to Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas at the presidency headquarters in Ramallah, it said.Al-Sudairi's arrival comes amid Israel's efforts to normalize relations with Saudi Arabia.During their meeting, Abbas welcomed Al-Sudairi and said his visit to Palestine and his appointment as Saudi ambassador to the State of Palestine would contribute to ""strengthening the strong fraternal relations that bind the two countries and the two brotherly peoples.""The Saudi ambassador said he hoped that his visit would be ""a successful beginning for strengthening relations in all fields,"" stressing his country's firm and supportive positions for the Palestinian people and their just cause.Earlier in the day, Al-Sudairi told reporters in a statement that ""the Arab Peace Initiative is the basic point in any upcoming agreement,"" after being asked about the fate of the initiative in the event of reaching a normalization deal between Saudi Arabia and Israel.The Arab Peace Initiative was launched in 2002 after it was drafted by Saudi Arabia and adopted by the Arab League.The initiative calls for an end to the conflict between Israel and Palestine and the normalization of relations between Israel and Arab states, in exchange for an Israeli withdrawal from the areas it gained since 1967 and proper settlement to the issue of Palestinian refugees.The Palestinians demanded the establishment of an independent state alongside Israel in all of the Palestinian territories occupied by Israel in 1967, including the entire West Bank and the Gaza Strip, with East Jerusalem as its capital.The Saudi ambassador also confirmed that his country intends to open a consulate in East Jerusalem soon.",PHOTO,WORLD,"Saudi ambassador to Palestine Naif bin Bandar Al-Sudairi (Front) arrives at the Palestinian foreign ministry headquarters in the West Bank city of Ramallah, on Sept. 26, 2023.(Photo: Xinhua)",Author details not found,Author details not found,12,313,<FreqDist with 15 samples and 181 outcomes>
China releases a white paper on its proposals and actions on building a global community of shared future,GT staff reporters,2023-09-26," The Chinese government released a white paper on Tuesday to introduce the theoretical base, practice and development of a global community of shared future, as by presenting China's vision of the course of human development, it counters the hegemonic thinking of certain countries that seek supremacy. The white paper, titled ""A Global Community of Shared Future: China's Proposals and Actions,"" introduced the background for China to raise the concept of a global community of shared future as the world is undergoing changes on a scale unseen in a century with various problems posing unprecedented challenges for human society. The zero-sum game is doomed to fail, the white paper said. But certain countries still cling to this mindset, blindly pursuing absolute security and monopolistic advantages, which will do nothing for their development in the long run but create a major threat to the world. It is increasingly obvious that the obsession with superior strength, and the zero-sum mentality are in conflict with the needs of our times, the white paper said, pointing out that the new era calls for new ideas. To build a global community of shared future is to pursue openness, inclusiveness, mutual benefit, equity and justice, the white paper said. The goal is not to replace one system or civilization with another. Instead, it is about countries with different social systems, ideologies, histories, shared rights, and shared responsibilities in global affairs. The vision of a global community of shared future stands on the right side of history and on the side of human progress. It introduces a new approach for international relations, provides new ideas for global governance, opens up new prospects for international exchanges and draws a new blueprint for a better world, according to the white paper. Such important vision transcends outdated mindsets such as zero-sum game, power politics, and Cold War confrontations. It has become the overall goal of China's major-country diplomacy in the new era, and a great banner that leads the trend of the times and the direction of human progress. The concept of a global community of shared future has deep roots in China's profound cultural heritage and its unique experience of modernization. It carries forward the diplomatic traditions of China and draws on the outstanding achievements of all other civilizations, the white paper said. It also manifests China's time-honored historical traditions, distinct characteristics of the times, and a wealth of humanistic values.  The white paper also pointed out the direction and plan to build a global community of shared future including pressing ahead with a new type of economic globalization in which countries need to pursue a policy of openness and explicitly oppose protectionism, the erection of fences and barriers, unilateral sanctions, and maximum-pressure tactics, so as to connect economies and jointly build an open world economy. Some countries are seeking to decouple from China, enclosing themselves in ""small yards, high fences,"" which will ultimately only backfire, the white paper said. Also, some people overstate the need to ""reduce dependence"" and ""de-risk,"" which is essentially creating new risks. The direction and the plan also include following a peaceful development plan, fostering a new type of international relations, practicing true multilateralism and promoting the common values of humanity. Over the past decade, China has contributed its strength to building a global community of shared future with firm conviction and solid actions. For instance, by July 2023, more than three-quarters of countries in the world and over 30 international organizations had signed agreements on Belt and Road cooperation with China. The BRI originated in China but the opportunities and achievements it creates belong to the whole world. It's an initiative for economic cooperation, not for geopolitical or military alliances, and it's open and inclusive process that neither targets nor excludes any party, the white paper said. Among those BRI projects, for example, the China-Laos Railway began operation on December 3, 2021, with 167 tunnels and 301 bridges built in 11 years along its total length of 1,035 kilometers. The railway construction created more than 110,000 local jobs, and helped build about 2,000 kilometers of roads and canals for villages along the railway, benefiting local people. Besides the BRI, the Global Development Initiative, the Global Security Initiative and Global Civilization Initiative have evolved into a crucial cornerstone for building a global community of shared future, offering China's solutions to major challenges pertaining to peace and development for humanity. Facing constant flare-ups of hotspot issues, China has been committed to fulfilling its role as a responsible major country, pushing for the resolution of international and regional flashpoints, such as the Korean Peninsula, Palestine, the Iranian nuclear issue, Syria and Afghanistan, the white paper said. On the Ukraine issue, China has actively promoted talks for peace, put forth four points, four things that the international community should do together and three observations, and released China's position on the political settlement of the Ukraine crisis and has dispatched the special representative of the Chinese government on Eurasian affairs to engage in extensive interactions and exchanges with stakeholders on the political settlement of the Ukraine crisis. Also, through the mediation of China, Saudi Arabia and Iran achieve historic reconciliation earlier this year, setting a fine example for countries in the region to resolve disputes and differences and achieve good neighborly relations through dialogue and consultation, and catalyzing a wave of reconciliation in the Middle East. China has also proposed a range of regional and bilateral initiatives on building communities of shared future and working with stakeholders to build consensus and expand cooperation, there by playing a constructive role in promoting regional peace and development. It also boosts international cooperation in fields including fighting the COVID-19 pandemic, addressing disorder in cyberspace governance and dealing with the global climate challenge. Over the past decade, the vision of a global community of shared future has gained broader support. More countries and people have come to the understanding that this vision serves the common interests of humanity, represents popular calls for peace, justice and progress, and can create the greatest synergy among all nations for building a better world, the white paper said.",CHINA,POLITICS,Photo: Li Xuanmin/GT,Author details not found,Author details not found,33,1000,<FreqDist with 17 samples and 603 outcomes>

F-35: Closer Look at Colossally Costly Jet That Just Can’t Seem to Stay Airborne,Sputnik,2023-09-21,"A US Marine Corps F-35B went down over South Carolina on Sunday after its pilot ejected mid-flight for reasons unknown. Why do F-35s seem so crash-prone? What’s wrong with them? And what role does the waste and fraud in the US military-industrial complex play in creating such a Frankenstein’s monster of an aircraft? Sputnik explores.Debris from the F-35B that went missing over South Carolina on September 17 was found in Williamsburg County, South Carolina, about two hours northeast of Joint Base Charleston on Monday following more than a day of frantic searching by the military. An as yet unspecified “mishap” was blamed for the accident. The pilot escaped unscathed.“The mishap is currently under investigation, and we are unable to provide additional details to preserve the integrity of the investigative process,” the Marine Corps said in a statement Monday. The Marines ordered a two-day global pause in all aerial operations, with the errant F-35B becoming the third major aviation-related accident suffered by the military branch in less than two months.Air units will be discussing “fundamentals of safe flight operations, ground safety, maintenance and flight procedures, and maintaining combat readiness,” the Marine Corps said.How Many F-35s Have Been Lost?Since it started being introduced into service with the Marines (2015), the US Air Force (2016), and the US Navy (2019) and began to be exported to foreign clients (starting with Israel in 2018), the F-35 has gained an unenviable reputation of being a costly, buggy, and crash-prone jet, with the F-35B that went down over South Carolina last week being at least the 11th Lightning II lost since 2018.On September 28, 2018, a US Marine Corps F-35B crashed during a flight near Marine Corps Air Station Beaufort in South Carolina, with a faulty fuel tube blamed for the incident. The pilot emerged unscathed.On April 9, 2019, a Japanese Self- Defense Force F-35A went down off Honshu, Japan. The pilot was killed after losing his bearings and suffering “special disorientation” mid-flight over the ocean.On May 19, 2020, a US Air Force F-35A from the 58th Fighter Squadron crashed while performing a landing at Eglin Air Force Base in western Florida. Pilot error (trying to land at excessive speed) and a mechanical defect related to a flight control glitch that left the plane’s tail unresponsive were blamed. The pilot survived.On September 29, 2020, a US Marine Corps F-35B was lost over Imperial County, California after colliding with a KC-130 tanker during midflight refueling. The tanker crew managed to bring their aircraft down for a hard landing. The F-35 pilot ejected successfully.On November 17, 2021, a British Royal Air Force F-35B plunged into the Mediterranean Sea after its pilot ejected during routine operations. That crash was ultimately blamed on a protective cover getting wedged into the plane’s engine intake.On January 4, 2022, a South Korean Air Force F-35A suffering from issues with its onboard avionics carried out an emergency belly landing. Investigators blamed a bird striking the warplane’s landing gear mid-flight. The pilot emerged unharmed.On January 24, 2022, a US Navy F-35C plunged into the South China Sea after making a hard landing on the USS Carl Vinson super carrier. The pilot and six sailors on the deck of the aircraft carrier were injured. A Navy investigation attributed the incident to pilot error.On October 19, 2022, another F-35, this one from the US Air Force, crashed at Hill Air Force Base in Utah during a training mission. The pilot ejected safely. It was later determined that turbulent air somehow confused the jet’s onboard avionics to the point where the aircraft became uncontrollable.On December 1, 2022, a Marine Corps F-35B collapsed on a military base in Japan after suffering a landing gear failure during training. No one was injured.Finally, on December 15, 2022, a US Navy F-35B crashed while attempting to perform a vertical landing at Naval Air Station Joint Reserve Base Fort Worth in Texas during testing of the jet’s systems. A “harmonic resonance” issue related to the jet’s Pratt & Whitney F135 engine was blamed, with the Pentagon halting further F-35 deliveries by Lockheed until an investigation was concluded.What’s Wrong With the F-35?Nearly 17 years after the F-35’s first flight, and eight years after its adoption into service, the F-35 continues to maintain a troublingly long list of technical bugs affecting both hardware and software. The aircraft, which has an astronomical total estimated purchase and sustainment price tag of over $1.7 trillion, and a per-plane cost of $70-$90 million, has faced years of harsh criticism from US officials, including former President Donald Trump at one point, who said the jet’s costs had spiraled “out of control.”At its heart, the F-35 is the product of an idea that metastasized in the Pentagon after the end of the Cold War, envisioning an all-in-one fighter platform which could be used by every branch of the military, equipped with vertical take-off and landing capability, and carry out a broad array of missions using a variety of onboard weapons. The do-it-all jet was supposed to replace nearly all of America’s fourth-gen fighter, strike, and ground attack aircraft, including the F-16 Falcon, the F/A-18 Hornet and Super Hornet, the AV-8B Harrier II, and others.The jet features just a single onboard engine – the aforementioned Pratt & Whitney F135, with engine-related troubles not only regularly referred to by watchdogs as a “leading driver” of the F-35’s problems remaining “mission capable,” but also making its operation over enemy territory or over the sea risky, since if something goes wrong, the plane doesn’t have a backup engine to limp home with.Throughout its production cycle, the F-35 Lightning II has suffered a dizzying and seemingly endless list of technical problems, from neck-snapping ejection seats to problems, ironically, while operating in stormy weather.In its 2023 report, the congressional Government Accountability Office revealed that the F-35 program “continues to experience schedule delays, cost growth, and late deliveries,” with procurement costs jumping by $13.4 billion since 2019, and modernization behind schedule and over budget.“As of January 2023, of the 821 open deficiencies, the program office characterized five of these as category 1 [i.e. critical issues which could jeopardize flight safety and security], and 816 as category 2, [i.e. those which could impede or constrain mission success].”In all, between December 2006 and 2023, the GAO has reported a whopping 277 category 1 and 2,467 category 2 deficiencies with the aircraft, among them serious issues like cabin over-pressurization, problems with the jets’ night vision systems, software bugs, radar issues, corrosion, ejection seats which could snap pilots’ necks, etc.Is a Culture of Largess to Blame?Sunday’s accident in South Carolina is the latest piece of F-35-related bad news for Lockheed Martin. In June, it was reported that the Pentagon had halted the delivery of any additional upgraded F-35s until major issues related to new Technology Refresh 3 (TR-3) hardware and weapons-related software were resolved. DoD F-35 program director Mike Schmidt told Congress in March that the risk assessment related to the TR-3 hardware upgrade wouldn’t be finished until April 2024.Despite the delays and array of technical problems, the weapons giant has continued to rack up generous contracts related to F-35 procurement and production. For example, in July, the US Navy ordered a $490 million package of equipment from Lockheed “to procure various material mod kits, special test/tooling equipment, as well as…product engineering” for already delivered, but defective planes. In August, Lockheed received another $606 million “fixed-price incentive (firm-target) undefinitized” contract “for long lead time materials, parts, components, and efforts to support of maintaining on-time production and delivery of 173 Lot 19 F-35 Joint Strike Fighter aircraft for Foreign Military Sales (FMS) customers and non-US Department of Defense (DOD) participants.”The terms of the contracts seem to be the culprit behind the F-35’s soaring costs (and Lockheed’s soaring profits, despite delivery of defective products), with so-called “cost-plus” and “undefinitized” contracts effectively making any overruns the buyer’s problem – i.e. that of US taxpayers, and of citizens of any country unfortunate enough to pen contracts for the planes from Lockheed.What About America’s Competitors?The worst part about the F-35’s troublesome history seems to be that the F-35 has already become ""obsolete"" in the sense that many of the US and NATO’s competitors have obtained the ability to defeat them, with Russia and China gaining capabilities to track and target the jets going back to the mid-to-late 2010s. In April, Iran announced that its engineers had created advanced radar technologies to not only detect F-35s, but identify the radar signature of individual F-35 planes, enabling the Islamic Republic to plan defensive operations accordingly.",WORLD,AMERICAS,Picture description not found,Author details not found,Author details not found,60,1305,<FreqDist with 18 samples and 775 outcomes>
Toxic explosion in Nebraska shows US unable to take issues affecting public security seriously: experts,Xu Yelu,2023-09-15,"Barely two months after an explosion in Louisiana, a train carrying toxic perchloric acid has exploded in a Nebraska rail yard on Thursday, prompting evacuation orders to be issued, as huge plumes are seen engulfing the city. Experts said the incident shows the US has been unable to take seriously and overcome major issues affecting public safety and the environment and ecology in the country.The incident happened on Union Pacific Railroad tracks in the city of North Platte. North Platte Volunteer Fire Department announced that they would order those living in the area to evacuate due to the toxic smoke from the railroad, according to media reports.In a post on social media platforms, it said that ""Emergency evacuation for the area between splinter and front North of railroad track due fire at the railroad involving heavy toxic smoke.""In a statement to DailyMail.com, Union Pacific Railroad said that an explosion occurred inside a container which resulted in several railcars catching fire. The railcar did not derail, the company said, and had been in the yard for several hours.Union Pacific said that one of the containers contained a hazardous chemical called perchloric acid, according to Daily Mail.Perchloric is a hazardous material used in food, drugs and biocidal products, as well as explosives, according to the report.Two months ago, a fire at a Louisiana chemical plant triggered explosions that shook homes several miles away and sent flames and smoke billowing into the air in mid-July, prompting emergency officials to urge a few hundred nearby residents to shelter indoors for several hours and to turn off their air conditioners, the Associated Press reported.Antiquated infrastructure and the outdated transportation were one factor. Another was a flawed system of governance in the US transport industry, experts noted. There is no doubt that the US has serious loopholes in the transportation management of hazardous substances, and the relevant error correction mechanism is in fact not effective, which means that this kind of thing will occur in the future, Li Haidong, a professor at the China Foreign Affairs University, told the Global Times on Friday.This shows that the US has been unable to take seriously and overcome serious and major issues affecting public safety and the environment and ecology in the country, Li said. ""It must be said that this is a great irony to the self-proclaimed internal governance of the most advanced country in the world.""Analysts said that the frequent occurrence of similar incidents shows that the error correction mechanism in the US has failed. Apart from this, racism and the proliferation of guns are also clear examples of the failure of error correction mechanisms, experts noted.",WORLD,AMERICAS,"A resident of East Palestine in the state of Ohio, US, angrily points during a town hall meeting held by the US

Greek scholar believes in ‘endless possibilities and vast land’ between China-Greece exchanges,Xu Liuliu,2023-09-14,"Chongqing, Sichuan, Shandong… Stelios Virvidakis expectantly plans his next China tour before a visit by the Global Times at his office in Athens, Greece. The University of Athens professor has grown far busier recently since he and four other Greek scholars launched the Center of Chinese and Greek Ancient Civilizations in February. Over the summer, the center has received two scholars from China who have given lectures on the history of China, and other visiting guests from places like Israel, who offered their views on Chinese medicine and its history, and a lecturer from France with insights in Chinese mathematics and how scholars in ancient China studied the living science.""Students found them to be very interesting and greatly appreciated the lectures,"" Virvidakis told the Global Times. ""Greece and China share so many similarities. So in my opinion, the horizon for our cooperation and exchanges is vast. There are endless possibilities which have not been explored.""Mutual learning Chinese President Xi Jinping replied to a letter from Virvidakis and four other Greek scholars earlier in 2023, extending congratulations over the founding of the Center of Chinese and Greek Ancient Civilizations.Hailing the long history of the Chinese civilization and profound influence of the ancient Greek civilization, Xi said in the letter that more than 2,000 years ago, the two civilizations shone brightly on the two ends of the Eurasian continent, jointly making a fundamental contribution to the evolution of human civilization.Greece's golden era produced many of its great philosophers and literary giants. The era coincided with a period in China in which ""a hundred schools of thought contended with each other"" and flourished together.As early as the 4th century BC, China was known to the Greeks by a beautiful name: Sērikḗ. In the 16th century, Euclid's Elements was introduced into China, paving the way for scientific exchanges between China and the West. The story of Prometheus narrated by Aeschylus was an inspiration to many Chinese revolutionaries. The Republic by Plato and Politics by Aristotle are also among the Greek classics known to have long made a name for themselves in China.In the eyes of Virvidakis, Chinese civilization has always been a culture that attracts people though the language is difficult. However, Chinese art, Chinese painting, Chinese poetry, especially love poems, even detective stories about China, are incredibly fascinating. Chinese director Zhang Yimou, and movies like Farewell My Concubine and Raise the Red Lantern starring Gong Li, are also very popular. Greek archaeologists who are interested in Chinese archeology want to know how China explores the past.In other art forms, the mythology and theater, ""we have tragedy, which is our own tradition. You have Chinese opera with music."" Actors and artists always want to study similarities and look at the differences, which is also the commitment of the center to promoting exchanges and mutual learning between the two civilizations and promoting the development of civilizations in various countries. China also has this appeal because people in the West think ""it's very different, it's exotic, something strange, but then they realize that it's beautiful for them."" So ""they find a lot of aspects that they have not thought about before in order to understand.""

Tiantan, a UNESCO World Heritage Site built in 1420, in Beijing Photo: VCGPhilosophy, a way of life There is a feeling among some people in the West that the Chinese system is different in some ways, said the professor. For instance,the European and American systems place great emphasis on individual rights, but China takes a more holistic approach in which ""harmony, social harmony is more important in sovereign.""""We are not exactly the same and there are also differences. But I don't believe in the so-called clash of civilizations theory that the clash is very deep and we can't live together with our differences,"" he told the Global Times. ""In fact we can live together and have peaceful exchanges. As I said, I don't think there is any danger of Greece threatening China or China occupying Greece.""In February, Virvidakis held a lecture at the center's launching ceremony, titled Philosophy is a Way of Life. Philosophy is not just theory, he said, noting that in ancient Greece and China it didn't mean just making theories about the universe, nature, god, or much of the unknown world. ""It told you how to 'organize' your life to feel happy and achieve harmony with others."" Western philosophy cannot be understood just by itself as there are also Chinese and Indian schools of philosophy among others. ""It is easier to see some similarities in ideas between Confucius and Socrates or Confucius and Aristotle,"" said Virvidakis, explaining why he is so fond of Chinese philosophy, especially Confucius thought. A simple question about what is a good life has a variety of answers in different philosophical theories.  But studying philosophy is practical and a way of life. Modern people don't just derive happiness from materialism. They need art and other emotionally stirring elements in life. In different parts and different cultures of the world,people can share similarities in emotion and sentiment.Virvidakis said that one of the most important reasons for his involving in such studies and exchanges was because ""I'm interested and I want to learn more. I'm a student too. When you are a teacher in your whole life, you're going to be a student.""",ARTS,CULTURE & LEISURE,The University of Athens Photo: VCG,"Reporter, Beijing","Global Times senior reporter, mainly covers the reporting of movies, TV, music and culture news.",43,880,<FreqDist with 16 samples and 473 outcomes>

 The first Saudi ambassador to Palestine Naif bin Bandar Al-Sudairi arrived in the West Bank on Tuesday, the official Palestinian news agency WAFA reported.Leading an official delegation, Al-Sudairi, the non-resident ambassador to Palestine and non-resident consul general in Jerusalem, presented his credentials to Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas at the presidency headquarters in Ramallah, it said.Al-Sudairi's arrival comes amid Israel's efforts to normalize relations with Saudi Arabia.During their meeting, Abbas welcomed Al-Sudairi and said his visit to Palestine and his appointment as Saudi ambassador to the State of Palestine would contribute to ""strengthening the strong fraternal relations that bind the two countries and the two brotherly peoples.""The Saudi ambassador said he hoped that his visit would be ""a successful beginning for strengthening relations in all fields,"" stressing his country's firm and supportive positions for the Palestinian people and their just cause.Earlier in the day, Al-Sudairi told reporters in a statement that ""the Arab Peace Initiative is the basic point in any upcoming agreement,"" after being asked about the fate of the initiative in the event of reaching a normalization deal between Saudi Arabia and Israel.The Arab Peace Initiative was launched in 2002 after it was drafted by Saudi Arabia and adopted by the Arab League.The initiative calls for an end to the conflict between Israel and Palestine and the normalization of relations between Israel and Arab states, in exchange for an Israeli withdrawal from the areas it gained since 1967 and proper settlement to the issue of Palestinian refugees.The Palestinians demanded the establishment of an independent state alongside Israel in all of the Palestinian territories occupied by Israel in 1967, including the entire West Bank and the Gaza Strip, with East Jerusalem as its capital.The Saudi ambassador also confirmed that his country intends to open a consulate in East Jerusalem soon.",PHOTO,WORLD,"Saudi ambassador to Palestine Naif bin Bandar Al-Sudairi (Front) arrives at the Palestinian foreign ministry headquarters in the West Bank city of Ramallah, on Sept. 26, 2023.(Photo: Xinhua)",Author details not found,Author details not found,12,313,<FreqDist with 15 samples and 181 outcomes>
China releases a white paper on its proposals and actions on building a global community of shared future,GT staff reporters,2023-09-26," The Chinese government released a white paper on Tuesday to introduce the theoretical base, practice and development of a global community of shared future, as by presenting China's vision of the course of human development, it counters the hegemonic thinking of certain countries that seek supremacy. The white paper, titled ""A Global Community of Shared Future: China's Proposals and Actions,"" introduced the background for China to raise the concept of a global community of shared future as the world is undergoing changes on a scale unseen in a century with various problems posing unprecedented challenges for human society. The zero-sum game is doomed to fail, the white paper said. But certain countries still cling to this mindset, blindly pursuing absolute security and monopolistic advantages, which will do nothing for their development in the long run but create a major threat to the world. It is increasingly obvious that the obsession with superior strength, and the zero-sum mentality are in conflict with the needs of our times, the white paper said, pointing out that the new era calls for new ideas. To build a global community of shared future is to pursue openness, inclusiveness, mutual benefit, equity and justice, the white paper said. The goal is not to replace one system or civilization with another. Instead, it is about countries with different social systems, ideologies, histories, shared rights, and shared responsibilities in global affairs. The vision of a global community of shared future stands on the right side of history and on the side of human progress. It introduces a new approach for international relations, provides new ideas for global governance, opens up new prospects for international exchanges and draws a new blueprint for a better world, according to the white paper. Such important vision transcends outdated mindsets such as zero-sum game, power politics, and Cold War confrontations. It has become the overall goal of China's major-country diplomacy in the new era, and a great banner that leads the trend of the times and the direction of human progress. The concept of a global community of shared future has deep roots in China's profound cultural heritage and its unique experience of modernization. It carries forward the diplomatic traditions of China and draws on the outstanding achievements of all other civilizations, the white paper said. It also manifests China's time-honored historical traditions, distinct characteristics of the times, and a wealth of humanistic values.  The white paper also pointed out the direction and plan to build a global community of shared future including pressing ahead with a new type of economic globalization in which countries need to pursue a policy of openness and explicitly oppose protectionism, the erection of fences and barriers, unilateral sanctions, and maximum-pressure tactics, so as to connect economies and jointly build an open world economy. Some countries are seeking to decouple from China, enclosing themselves in ""small yards, high fences,"" which will ultimately only backfire, the white paper said. Also, some people overstate the need to ""reduce dependence"" and ""de-risk,"" which is essentially creating new risks. The direction and the plan also include following a peaceful development plan, fostering a new type of international relations, practicing true multilateralism and promoting the common values of humanity. Over the past decade, China has contributed its strength to building a global community of shared future with firm conviction and solid actions. For instance, by July 2023, more than three-quarters of countries in the world and over 30 international organizations had signed agreements on Belt and Road cooperation with China. The BRI originated in China but the opportunities and achievements it creates belong to the whole world. It's an initiative for economic cooperation, not for geopolitical or military alliances, and it's open and inclusive process that neither targets nor excludes any party, the white paper said. Among those BRI projects, for example, the China-Laos Railway began operation on December 3, 2021, with 167 tunnels and 301 bridges built in 11 years along its total length of 1,035 kilometers. The railway construction created more than 110,000 local jobs, and helped build about 2,000 kilometers of roads and canals for villages along the railway, benefiting local people. Besides the BRI, the Global Development Initiative, the Global Security Initiative and Global Civilization Initiative have evolved into a crucial cornerstone for building a global community of shared future, offering China's solutions to major challenges pertaining to peace and development for humanity. Facing constant flare-ups of hotspot issues, China has been committed to fulfilling its role as a responsible major country, pushing for the resolution of international and regional flashpoints, such as the Korean Peninsula, Palestine, the Iranian nuclear issue, Syria and Afghanistan, the white paper said. On the Ukraine issue, China has actively promoted talks for peace, put forth four points, four things that the international community should do together and three observations, and released China's position on the political settlement of the Ukraine crisis and has dispatched the special representative of the Chinese government on Eurasian affairs to engage in extensive interactions and exchanges with stakeholders on the political settlement of the Ukraine crisis. Also, through the mediation of China, Saudi Arabia and Iran achieve historic reconciliation earlier this year, setting a fine example for countries in the region to resolve disputes and differences and achieve good neighborly relations through dialogue and consultation, and catalyzing a wave of reconciliation in the Middle East. China has also proposed a range of regional and bilateral initiatives on building communities of shared future and working with stakeholders to build consensus and expand cooperation, there by playing a constructive role in promoting regional peace and development. It also boosts international cooperation in fields including fighting the COVID-19 pandemic, addressing disorder in cyberspace governance and dealing with the global climate challenge. Over the past decade, the vision of a global community of shared future has gained broader support.

F-35: Closer Look at Colossally Costly Jet That Just Can’t Seem to Stay Airborne,Sputnik,2023-09-21,"A US Marine Corps F-35B went down over South Carolina on Sunday after its pilot ejected mid-flight for reasons unknown. Why do F-35s seem so crash-prone? What’s wrong with them? And what role does the waste and fraud in the US military-industrial complex play in creating such a Frankenstein’s monster of an aircraft? Sputnik explores.Debris from the F-35B that went missing over South Carolina on September 17 was found in Williamsburg County, South Carolina, about two hours northeast of Joint Base Charleston on Monday following more than a day of frantic searching by the military. An as yet unspecified “mishap” was blamed for the accident. The pilot escaped unscathed.“The mishap is currently under investigation, and we are unable to provide additional details to preserve the integrity of the investigative process,” the Marine Corps said in a statement Monday. The Marines ordered a two-day global pause in all aerial operations, with the errant F-35B becoming the third major aviation-related accident suffered by the military branch in less than two months.Air units will be discussing “fundamentals of safe flight operations, ground safety, maintenance and flight procedures, and maintaining combat readiness,” the Marine Corps said.How Many F-35s Have Been Lost?Since it started being introduced into service with the Marines (2015), the US Air Force (2016), and the US Navy (2019) and began to be exported to foreign clients (starting with Israel in 2018), the F-35 has gained an unenviable reputation of being a costly, buggy, and crash-prone jet, with the F-35B that went down over South Carolina last week being at least the 11th Lightning II lost since 2018.On September 28, 2018, a US Marine Corps F-35B crashed during a flight near Marine Corps Air Station Beaufort in South Carolina, with a faulty fuel tube blamed for the incident. The pilot emerged unscathed.On April 9, 2019, a Japanese Self- Defense Force F-35A went down off Honshu, Japan. The pilot was killed after losing his bearings and suffering “special disorientation” mid-flight over the ocean.On May 19, 2020, a US Air Force F-35A from the 58th Fighter Squadron crashed while performing a landing at Eglin Air Force Base in western Florida. Pilot error (trying to land at excessive speed) and a mechanical defect related to a flight control glitch that left the plane’s tail unresponsive were blamed. The pilot survived.On September 29, 2020, a US Marine Corps F-35B was lost over Imperial County, California after colliding with a KC-130 tanker during midflight refueling. The tanker crew managed to bring their aircraft down for a hard landing. The F-35 pilot ejected successfully.On November 17, 2021, a British Royal Air Force F-35B plunged into the Mediterranean Sea after its pilot ejected during routine operations. That crash was ultimately blamed on a protective cover getting wedged into the plane’s engine intake.On January 4, 2022, a South Korean Air Force F-35A suffering from issues with its onboard avionics carried out an emergency belly landing. Investigators blamed a bird striking the warplane’s landing gear mid-flight. The pilot emerged unharmed.On January 24, 2022, a US Navy F-35C plunged into the South China Sea after making a hard landing on the USS Carl Vinson super carrier. The pilot and six sailors on the deck of the aircraft carrier were injured. A Navy investigation attributed the incident to pilot error.On October 19, 2022, another F-35, this one from the US Air Force, crashed at Hill Air Force Base in Utah during a training mission. The pilot ejected safely. It was later determined that turbulent air somehow confused the jet’s onboard avionics to the point where the aircraft became uncontrollable.On December 1, 2022, a Marine Corps F-35B collapsed on a military base in Japan after suffering a landing gear failure during training. No one was injured.Finally, on December 15, 2022, a US Navy F-35B crashed while attempting to perform a vertical landing at Naval Air Station Joint Reserve Base Fort Worth in Texas during testing of the jet’s systems. A “harmonic resonance” issue related to the jet’s Pratt & Whitney F135 engine was blamed, with the Pentagon halting further F-35 deliveries by Lockheed until an investigation was concluded.What’s Wrong With the F-35?Nearly 17 years after the F-35’s first flight, and eight years after its adoption into service, the F-35 continues to maintain a troublingly long list of technical bugs affecting both hardware and software. The aircraft, which has an astronomical total estimated purchase and sustainment price tag of over $1.7 trillion, and a per-plane cost of $70-$90 million, has faced years of harsh criticism from US officials, including former President Donald Trump at one point, who said the jet’s costs had spiraled “out of control.”At its heart, the F-35 is the product of an idea that metastasized in the Pentagon after the end of the Cold War, envisioning an all-in-one fighter platform which could be used by every branch of the military, equipped with vertical take-off and landing capability, and carry out a broad array of missions using a variety of onboard weapons. The do-it-all jet was supposed to replace nearly all of America’s fourth-gen fighter, strike, and ground attack aircraft, including the F-16 Falcon, the F/A-18 Hornet and Super Hornet, the AV-8B Harrier II, and others.The jet features just a single onboard engine – the aforementioned Pratt & Whitney F135, with engine-related troubles not only regularly referred to by watchdogs as a “leading driver” of the F-35’s problems remaining “mission capable,” but also making its operation over enemy territory or over the sea risky, since if something goes wrong, the plane doesn’t have a backup engine to limp home with.Throughout its production cycle, the F-35 Lightning II has suffered a dizzying and seemingly endless list of technical problems, from neck-snapping ejection seats to problems, ironically, while operating in stormy weather.In its 2023 report, the congressional Government Accountability Office revealed that the F-35 program “continues to experience schedule delays, cost growth, and late deliveries,” with procurement costs jumping by $13.4 billion since 2019, and modernization behind schedule and over budget.“As of January 2023, of the 821 open deficiencies, the program office characterized five of these as category 1 [i.e. critical issues which could jeopardize flight safety and security], and 816 as category 2, [i.e. those which could impede or constrain mission success].”In all, between December 2006 and 2023, the GAO has reported a whopping 277 category 1 and 2,467 category 2 deficiencies with the aircraft, among them serious issues like cabin over-pressurization, problems with the jets’ night vision systems, software bugs, radar issues, corrosion, ejection seats which could snap pilots’ necks, etc.Is a Culture of Largess to Blame?Sunday’s accident in South Carolina is the latest piece of F-35-related bad news for Lockheed Martin. In June, it was reported that the Pentagon had halted the delivery of any additional upgraded F-35s until major issues related to new Technology Refresh 3 (TR-3) hardware and weapons-related software were resolved. DoD F-35 program director Mike Schmidt told Congress in March that the risk assessment related to the TR-3 hardware upgrade wouldn’t be finished until April 2024.Despite the delays and array of technical problems, the weapons giant has continued to rack up generous contracts related to F-35 procurement and production. For example, in July, the US Navy ordered a $490 million package of equipment from Lockheed “to procure various material mod kits, special test/tooling equipment, as well as…product engineering” for already delivered, but defective planes. In August, Lockheed received another $606 million “fixed-price incentive (firm-target) undefinitized” contract “for long lead time materials, parts, components, and efforts to support of maintaining on-time production and delivery of 173 Lot 19 F-35 Joint Strike Fighter aircraft for Foreign Military Sales (FMS) customers and non-US Department of Defense (DOD) participants.”The terms of the contracts seem to be the culprit behind the F-35’s soaring costs (and Lockheed’s soaring profits, despite delivery of defective products), with so-called “cost-plus” and “undefinitized” contracts effectively making any overruns the buyer’s problem – i.e. that of US taxpayers, and of citizens of any country unfortunate enough to pen contracts for the planes from Lockheed.What About America’s Competitors?The worst part about the F-35’s troublesome history seems to be that the F-35 has already become ""obsolete"" in the sense that many of the US and NATO’s competitors have obtained the ability to defeat them, with Russia and China gaining capabilities to track and target the jets going back to the mid-to-late 2010s. In April, Iran announced that its engineers had created advanced radar technologies to not only detect F-35s, but identify the radar signature of individual F-35 planes, enabling the Islamic Republic to plan defensive operations accordingly.",WORLD,AMERICAS,Picture description not found,Author details not found,Author details not found,60,1305,<FreqDist with 18 samples and 775 outcomes>
Toxic explosion in Nebraska shows US unable to take issues affecting public security seriously: experts,Xu Yelu,2023-09-15,"Barely two months after an explosion in Louisiana, a train carrying toxic perchloric acid has exploded in a Nebraska rail yard on Thursday, prompting evacuation orders to be issued, as huge plumes are seen engulfing the city. Experts said the incident shows the US has been unable to take seriously and overcome major issues affecting public safety and the environment and ecology in the country.The incident happened on Union Pacific Railroad tracks in the city of North Platte. North Platte Volunteer Fire Department announced that they would order those living in the area to evacuate due to the toxic smoke from the railroad, according to media reports.In a post on social media platforms, it said that ""Emergency evacuation for the area between splinter and front North of railroad track due fire at the railroad involving heavy toxic smoke.""In a statement to DailyMail.com, Union Pacific Railroad said that an explosion occurred inside a container which resulted in several railcars catching fire. The railcar did not derail, the company said, and had been in the yard for several hours.Union Pacific said that one of the containers contained a hazardous chemical called perchloric acid, according to Daily Mail.Perchloric is a hazardous material used in food, drugs and biocidal products, as well as explosives, according to the report.Two months ago, a fire at a Louisiana chemical plant triggered explosions that shook homes several miles away and sent flames and smoke billowing into the air in mid-July, prompting emergency officials to urge a few hundred nearby residents to shelter indoors for several hours and to turn off their air conditioners, the Associated Press reported.Antiquated infrastructure and the outdated transportation were one factor. Another was a flawed system of governance in the US transport industry, experts noted. There is no doubt that the US has serious loopholes in the transportation management of hazardous substances, and the relevant error correction mechanism is in fact not effective, which means that this kind of thing will occur in the future, Li Haidong, a professor at the China Foreign Affairs University, told the Global Times on Friday.This shows that the US has been unable to take seriously and overcome serious and major issues affecting public safety and the environment and ecology in the country, Li said. ""It must be said that this is a great irony to the self-proclaimed internal governance of the most advanced country in the world.""Analysts said that the frequent occurrence of similar incidents shows that the error correction mechanism in the US has failed. Apart from this, racism and the proliferation of guns are also clear examples of the failure of error correction mechanisms, experts noted.",WORLD,AMERICAS,"A resident of East Palestine in the state of Ohio, US, angrily points during a town hall meeting held by the US

Greek scholar believes in ‘endless possibilities and vast land’ between China-Greece exchanges,Xu Liuliu,2023-09-14,"Chongqing, Sichuan, Shandong… Stelios Virvidakis expectantly plans his next China tour before a visit by the Global Times at his office in Athens, Greece. The University of Athens professor has grown far busier recently since he and four other Greek scholars launched the Center of Chinese and Greek Ancient Civilizations in February. Over the summer, the center has received two scholars from China who have given lectures on the history of China, and other visiting guests from places like Israel, who offered their views on Chinese medicine and its history, and a lecturer from France with insights in Chinese mathematics and how scholars in ancient China studied the living science.""Students found them to be very interesting and greatly appreciated the lectures,"" Virvidakis told the Global Times. ""Greece and China share so many similarities. So in my opinion, the horizon for our cooperation and exchanges is vast. There are endless possibilities which have not been explored.""Mutual learning Chinese President Xi Jinping replied to a letter from Virvidakis and four other Greek scholars earlier in 2023, extending congratulations over the founding of the Center of Chinese and Greek Ancient Civilizations.Hailing the long history of the Chinese civilization and profound influence of the ancient Greek civilization, Xi said in the letter that more than 2,000 years ago, the two civilizations shone brightly on the two ends of the Eurasian continent, jointly making a fundamental contribution to the evolution of human civilization.Greece's golden era produced many of its great philosophers and literary giants. The era coincided with a period in China in which ""a hundred schools of thought contended with each other"" and flourished together.As early as the 4th century BC, China was known to the Greeks by a beautiful name: Sērikḗ. In the 16th century, Euclid's Elements was introduced into China, paving the way for scientific exchanges between China and the West. The story of Prometheus narrated by Aeschylus was an inspiration to many Chinese revolutionaries. The Republic by Plato and Politics by Aristotle are also among the Greek classics known to have long made a name for themselves in China.In the eyes of Virvidakis, Chinese civilization has always been a culture that attracts people though the language is difficult. However, Chinese art, Chinese painting, Chinese poetry, especially love poems, even detective stories about China, are incredibly fascinating. Chinese director Zhang Yimou, and movies like Farewell My Concubine and Raise the Red Lantern starring Gong Li, are also very popular. Greek archaeologists who are interested in Chinese archeology want to know how China explores the past.In other art forms, the mythology and theater, ""we have tragedy, which is our own tradition. You have Chinese opera with music."" Actors and artists always want to study similarities and look at the differences, which is also the commitment of the center to promoting exchanges and mutual learning between the two civilizations and promoting the development of civilizations in various countries. China also has this appeal because people in the West think ""it's very different, it's exotic, something strange, but then they realize that it's beautiful for them."" So ""they find a lot of aspects that they have not thought about before in order to understand.""

Tiantan, a UNESCO World Heritage Site built in 1420, in Beijing Photo: VCGPhilosophy, a way of life There is a feeling among some people in the West that the Chinese system is different in some ways, said the professor. For instance,the European and American systems place great emphasis on individual rights, but China takes a more holistic approach in which ""harmony, social harmony is more important in sovereign.""""We are not exactly the same and there are also differences. But I don't believe in the so-called clash of civilizations theory that the clash is very deep and we can't live together with our differences,"" he told the Global Times. ""In fact we can live together and have peaceful exchanges. As I said, I don't think there is any danger of Greece threatening China or China occupying Greece.""In February, Virvidakis held a lecture at the center's launching ceremony, titled Philosophy is a Way of Life. Philosophy is not just theory, he said, noting that in ancient Greece and China it didn't mean just making theories about the universe, nature, god, or much of the unknown world. ""It told you how to 'organize' your life to feel happy and achieve harmony with others."" Western philosophy cannot be understood just by itself as there are also Chinese and Indian schools of philosophy among others. ""It is easier to see some similarities in ideas between Confucius and Socrates or Confucius and Aristotle,"" said Virvidakis, explaining why he is so fond of Chinese philosophy, especially Confucius thought. A simple question about what is a good life has a variety of answers in different philosophical theories.  But studying philosophy is practical and a way of life. Modern people don't just derive happiness from materialism. They need art and other emotionally stirring elements in life. In different parts and different cultures of the world,people can share similarities in emotion and sentiment.Virvidakis said that one of the most important reasons for his involving in such studies and exchanges was because ""I'm interested and I want to learn more. I'm a student too. When you are a teacher in your whole life, you're going to be a student.""",ARTS,CULTURE & LEISURE,The University of Athens Photo: VCG,"Reporter, Beijing","Global Times senior reporter, mainly covers the reporting of movies, TV, music and culture news.",43,880,<FreqDist with 16 samples and 473 outcomes>

 The first Saudi ambassador to Palestine Naif bin Bandar Al-Sudairi arrived in the West Bank on Tuesday, the official Palestinian news agency WAFA reported.Leading an official delegation, Al-Sudairi, the non-resident ambassador to Palestine and non-resident consul general in Jerusalem, presented his credentials to Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas at the presidency headquarters in Ramallah, it said.Al-Sudairi's arrival comes amid Israel's efforts to normalize relations with Saudi Arabia.During their meeting, Abbas welcomed Al-Sudairi and said his visit to Palestine and his appointment as Saudi ambassador to the State of Palestine would contribute to ""strengthening the strong fraternal relations that bind the two countries and the two brotherly peoples.""The Saudi ambassador said he hoped that his visit would be ""a successful beginning for strengthening relations in all fields,"" stressing his country's firm and supportive positions for the Palestinian people and their just cause.Earlier in the day, Al-Sudairi told reporters in a statement that ""the Arab Peace Initiative is the basic point in any upcoming agreement,"" after being asked about the fate of the initiative in the event of reaching a normalization deal between Saudi Arabia and Israel.The Arab Peace Initiative was launched in 2002 after it was drafted by Saudi Arabia and adopted by the Arab League.The initiative calls for an end to the conflict between Israel and Palestine and the normalization of relations between Israel and Arab states, in exchange for an Israeli withdrawal from the areas it gained since 1967 and proper settlement to the issue of Palestinian refugees.The Palestinians demanded the establishment of an independent state alongside Israel in all of the Palestinian territories occupied by Israel in 1967, including the entire West Bank and the Gaza Strip, with East Jerusalem as its capital.The Saudi ambassador also confirmed that his country intends to open a consulate in East Jerusalem soon.",PHOTO,WORLD,"Saudi ambassador to Palestine Naif bin Bandar Al-Sudairi (Front) arrives at the Palestinian foreign ministry headquarters in the West Bank city of Ramallah, on Sept. 26, 2023.(Photo: Xinhua)",Author details not found,Author details not found,12,313,<FreqDist with 15 samples and 181 outcomes>
China releases a white paper on its proposals and actions on building a global community of shared future,GT staff reporters,2023-09-26," The Chinese government released a white paper on Tuesday to introduce the theoretical base, practice and development of a global community of shared future, as by presenting China's vision of the course of human development, it counters the hegemonic thinking of certain countries that seek supremacy. The white paper, titled ""A Global Community of Shared Future: China's Proposals and Actions,"" introduced the background for China to raise the concept of a global community of shared future as the world is undergoing changes on a scale unseen in a century with various problems posing unprecedented challenges for human society. The zero-sum game is doomed to fail, the white paper said. But certain countries still cling to this mindset, blindly pursuing absolute security and monopolistic advantages, which will do nothing for their development in the long run but create a major threat to the world. It is increasingly obvious that the obsession with superior strength, and the zero-sum mentality are in conflict with the needs of our times, the white paper said, pointing out that the new era calls for new ideas. To build a global community of shared future is to pursue openness, inclusiveness, mutual benefit, equity and justice, the white paper said. The goal is not to replace one system or civilization with another. Instead, it is about countries with different social systems, ideologies, histories, shared rights, and shared responsibilities in global affairs. The vision of a global community of shared future stands on the right side of history and on the side of human progress. It introduces a new approach for international relations, provides new ideas for global governance, opens up new prospects for international exchanges and draws a new blueprint for a better world, according to the white paper. Such important vision transcends outdated mindsets such as zero-sum game, power politics, and Cold War confrontations. It has become the overall goal of China's major-country diplomacy in the new era, and a great banner that leads the trend of the times and the direction of human progress. The concept of a global community of shared future has deep roots in China's profound cultural heritage and its unique experience of modernization. It carries forward the diplomatic traditions of China and draws on the outstanding achievements of all other civilizations, the white paper said. It also manifests China's time-honored historical traditions, distinct characteristics of the times, and a wealth of humanistic values.  The white paper also pointed out the direction and plan to build a global community of shared future including pressing ahead with a new type of economic globalization in which countries need to pursue a policy of openness and explicitly oppose protectionism, the erection of fences and barriers, unilateral sanctions, and maximum-pressure tactics, so as to connect economies and jointly build an open world economy. Some countries are seeking to decouple from China, enclosing themselves in ""small yards, high fences,"" which will ultimately only backfire, the white paper said. Also, some people overstate the need to ""reduce dependence"" and ""de-risk,"" which is essentially creating new risks. The direction and the plan also include following a peaceful development plan, fostering a new type of international relations, practicing true multilateralism and promoting the common values of humanity. Over the past decade, China has contributed its strength to building a global community of shared future with firm conviction and solid actions. For instance, by July 2023, more than three-quarters of countries in the world and over 30 international organizations had signed agreements on Belt and Road cooperation with China. The BRI originated in China but the opportunities and achievements it creates belong to the whole world. It's an initiative for economic cooperation, not for geopolitical or military alliances, and it's open and inclusive process that neither targets nor excludes any party, the white paper said. Among those BRI projects, for example, the China-Laos Railway began operation on December 3, 2021, with 167 tunnels and 301 bridges built in 11 years along its total length of 1,035 kilometers. The railway construction created more than 110,000 local jobs, and helped build about 2,000 kilometers of roads and canals for villages along the railway, benefiting local people. Besides the BRI, the Global Development Initiative, the Global Security Initiative and Global Civilization Initiative have evolved into a crucial cornerstone for building a global community of shared future, offering China's solutions to major challenges pertaining to peace and development for humanity. Facing constant flare-ups of hotspot issues, China has been committed to fulfilling its role as a responsible major country, pushing for the resolution of international and regional flashpoints, such as the Korean Peninsula, Palestine, the Iranian nuclear issue, Syria and Afghanistan, the white paper said. On the Ukraine issue, China has actively promoted talks for peace, put forth four points, four things that the international community should do together and three observations, and released China's position on the political settlement of the Ukraine crisis and has dispatched the special representative of the Chinese government on Eurasian affairs to engage in extensive interactions and exchanges with stakeholders on the political settlement of the Ukraine crisis. Also, through the mediation of China, Saudi Arabia and Iran achieve historic reconciliation earlier this year, setting a fine example for countries in the region to resolve disputes and differences and achieve good neighborly relations through dialogue and consultation, and catalyzing a wave of reconciliation in the Middle East. China has also proposed a range of regional and bilateral initiatives on building communities of shared future and working with stakeholders to build consensus and expand cooperation, there by playing a constructive role in promoting regional peace and development. It also boosts international cooperation in fields including fighting the COVID-19 pandemic, addressing disorder in cyberspace governance and dealing with the global climate challenge. Over the past decade, the vision of a global community of shared future has gained broader support. More countries and people have come to the understanding that this vision serves the common interests of humanity, represents popular calls for peace, justice and progress, and can create the greatest synergy among all nations for building a better world, the white paper said.",CHINA,POLITICS,Photo: Li Xuanmin/GT,Author details not found,Author details not found,33,1000,<FreqDist with 17 samples and 603 outcomes>

F-35: Closer Look at Colossally Costly Jet That Just Can’t Seem to Stay Airborne,Sputnik,2023-09-21,"A US Marine Corps F-35B went down over South Carolina on Sunday after its pilot ejected mid-flight for reasons unknown. Why do F-35s seem so crash-prone? What’s wrong with them? And what role does the waste and fraud in the US military-industrial complex play in creating such a Frankenstein’s monster of an aircraft? Sputnik explores.Debris from the F-35B that went missing over South Carolina on September 17 was found in Williamsburg County, South Carolina, about two hours northeast of Joint Base Charleston on Monday following more than a day of frantic searching by the military. An as yet unspecified “mishap” was blamed for the accident. The pilot escaped unscathed.“The mishap is currently under investigation, and we are unable to provide additional details to preserve the integrity of the investigative process,” the Marine Corps said in a statement Monday. The Marines ordered a two-day global pause in all aerial operations, with the errant F-35B becoming the third major aviation-related accident suffered by the military branch in less than two months.Air units will be discussing “fundamentals of safe flight operations, ground safety, maintenance and flight procedures, and maintaining combat readiness,” the Marine Corps said.How Many F-35s Have Been Lost?Since it started being introduced into service with the Marines (2015), the US Air Force (2016), and the US Navy (2019) and began to be exported to foreign clients (starting with Israel in 2018), the F-35 has gained an unenviable reputation of being a costly, buggy, and crash-prone jet, with the F-35B that went down over South Carolina last week being at least the 11th Lightning II lost since 2018.On September 28, 2018, a US Marine Corps F-35B crashed during a flight near Marine Corps Air Station Beaufort in South Carolina, with a faulty fuel tube blamed for the incident. The pilot emerged unscathed.On April 9, 2019, a Japanese Self- Defense Force F-35A went down off Honshu, Japan. The pilot was killed after losing his bearings and suffering “special disorientation” mid-flight over the ocean.On May 19, 2020, a US Air Force F-35A from the 58th Fighter Squadron crashed while performing a landing at Eglin Air Force Base in western Florida. Pilot error (trying to land at excessive speed) and a mechanical defect related to a flight control glitch that left the plane’s tail unresponsive were blamed. The pilot survived.On September 29, 2020, a US Marine Corps F-35B was lost over Imperial County, California after colliding with a KC-130 tanker during midflight refueling. The tanker crew managed to bring their aircraft down for a hard landing. The F-35 pilot ejected successfully.On November 17, 2021, a British Royal Air Force F-35B plunged into the Mediterranean Sea after its pilot ejected during routine operations. That crash was ultimately blamed on a protective cover getting wedged into the plane’s engine intake.On January 4, 2022, a South Korean Air Force F-35A suffering from issues with its onboard avionics carried out an emergency belly landing. Investigators blamed a bird striking the warplane’s landing gear mid-flight. The pilot emerged unharmed.On January 24, 2022, a US Navy F-35C plunged into the South China Sea after making a hard landing on the USS Carl Vinson super carrier. The pilot and six sailors on the deck of the aircraft carrier were injured. A Navy investigation attributed the incident to pilot error.On October 19, 2022, another F-35, this one from the US Air Force, crashed at Hill Air Force Base in Utah during a training mission. The pilot ejected safely. It was later determined that turbulent air somehow confused the jet’s onboard avionics to the point where the aircraft became uncontrollable.On December 1, 2022, a Marine Corps F-35B collapsed on a military base in Japan after suffering a landing gear failure during training. No one was injured.Finally, on December 15, 2022, a US Navy F-35B crashed while attempting to perform a vertical landing at Naval Air Station Joint Reserve Base Fort Worth in Texas during testing of the jet’s systems. A “harmonic resonance” issue related to the jet’s Pratt & Whitney F135 engine was blamed, with the Pentagon halting further F-35 deliveries by Lockheed until an investigation was concluded.What’s Wrong With the F-35?Nearly 17 years after the F-35’s first flight, and eight years after its adoption into service, the F-35 continues to maintain a troublingly long list of technical bugs affecting both hardware and software. The aircraft, which has an astronomical total estimated purchase and sustainment price tag of over $1.7 trillion, and a per-plane cost of $70-$90 million, has faced years of harsh criticism from US officials, including former President Donald Trump at one point, who said the jet’s costs had spiraled “out of control.”At its heart, the F-35 is the product of an idea that metastasized in the Pentagon after the end of the Cold War, envisioning an all-in-one fighter platform which could be used by every branch of the military, equipped with vertical take-off and landing capability, and carry out a broad array of missions using a variety of onboard weapons. The do-it-all jet was supposed to replace nearly all of America’s fourth-gen fighter, strike, and ground attack aircraft, including the F-16 Falcon, the F/A-18 Hornet and Super Hornet, the AV-8B Harrier II, and others.The jet features just a single onboard engine – the aforementioned Pratt & Whitney F135, with engine-related troubles not only regularly referred to by watchdogs as a “leading driver” of the F-35’s problems remaining “mission capable,” but also making its operation over enemy territory or over the sea risky, since if something goes wrong, the plane doesn’t have a backup engine to limp home with.Throughout its production cycle, the F-35 Lightning II has suffered a dizzying and seemingly endless list of technical problems, from neck-snapping ejection seats to problems, ironically, while operating in stormy weather.In its 2023 report, the congressional Government Accountability Office revealed that the F-35 program “continues to experience schedule delays, cost growth, and late deliveries,” with procurement costs jumping by $13.4 billion since 2019, and modernization behind schedule and over budget.“As of January 2023, of the 821 open deficiencies, the program office characterized five of these as category 1 [i.e. critical issues which could jeopardize flight safety and security], and 816 as category 2, [i.e. those which could impede or constrain mission success].”In all, between December 2006 and 2023, the GAO has reported a whopping 277 category 1 and 2,467 category 2 deficiencies with the aircraft, among them serious issues like cabin over-pressurization, problems with the jets’ night vision systems, software bugs, radar issues, corrosion, ejection seats which could snap pilots’ necks, etc.Is a Culture of Largess to Blame?Sunday’s accident in South Carolina is the latest piece of F-35-related bad news for Lockheed Martin. In June, it was reported that the Pentagon had halted the delivery of any additional upgraded F-35s until major issues related to new Technology Refresh 3 (TR-3) hardware and weapons-related software were resolved. DoD F-35 program director Mike Schmidt told Congress in March that the risk assessment related to the TR-3 hardware upgrade wouldn’t be finished until April 2024.Despite the delays and array of technical problems, the weapons giant has continued to rack up generous contracts related to F-35 procurement and production. For example, in July, the US Navy ordered a $490 million package of equipment from Lockheed “to procure various material mod kits, special test/tooling equipment, as well as…product engineering” for already delivered, but defective planes. In August, Lockheed received another $606 million “fixed-price incentive (firm-target) undefinitized” contract “for long lead time materials, parts, components, and efforts to support of maintaining on-time production and delivery of 173 Lot 19 F-35 Joint Strike Fighter aircraft for Foreign Military Sales (FMS) customers and non-US Department of Defense (DOD) participants.”The terms of the contracts seem to be the culprit behind the F-35’s soaring costs (and Lockheed’s soaring profits, despite delivery of defective products), with so-called “cost-plus” and “undefinitized” contracts effectively making any overruns the buyer’s problem – i.e. that of US taxpayers, and of citizens of any country unfortunate enough to pen contracts for the planes from Lockheed.What About America’s Competitors?The worst part about the F-35’s troublesome history seems to be that the F-35 has already become ""obsolete"" in the sense that many of the US and NATO’s competitors have obtained the ability to defeat them, with Russia and China gaining capabilities to track and target the jets going back to the mid-to-late 2010s. In April, Iran announced that its engineers had created advanced radar technologies to not only detect F-35s, but identify the radar signature of individual F-35 planes, enabling the Islamic Republic to plan defensive operations accordingly.",WORLD,AMERICAS,Picture description not found,Author details not found,Author details not found,60,1305,<FreqDist with 18 samples and 775 outcomes>
Toxic explosion in Nebraska shows US unable to take issues affecting public security seriously: experts,Xu Yelu,2023-09-15,"Barely two months after an explosion in Louisiana, a train carrying toxic perchloric acid has exploded in a Nebraska rail yard on Thursday, prompting evacuation orders to be issued, as huge plumes are seen engulfing the city. Experts said the incident shows the US has been unable to take seriously and overcome major issues affecting public safety and the environment and ecology in the country.The incident happened on Union Pacific Railroad tracks in the city of North Platte. North Platte Volunteer Fire Department announced that they would order those living in the area to evacuate due to the toxic smoke from the railroad, according to media reports.In a post on social media platforms, it said that ""Emergency evacuation for the area between splinter and front North of railroad track due fire at the railroad involving heavy toxic smoke.""In a statement to DailyMail.com, Union Pacific Railroad said that an explosion occurred inside a container which resulted in several railcars catching fire. The railcar did not derail, the company said, and had been in the yard for several hours.Union Pacific said that one of the containers contained a hazardous chemical called perchloric acid, according to Daily Mail.Perchloric is a hazardous material used in food, drugs and biocidal products, as well as explosives, according to the report.Two months ago, a fire at a Louisiana chemical plant triggered explosions that shook homes several miles away and sent flames and smoke billowing into the air in mid-July, prompting emergency officials to urge a few hundred nearby residents to shelter indoors for several hours and to turn off their air conditioners, the Associated Press reported.Antiquated infrastructure and the outdated transportation were one factor. Another was a flawed system of governance in the US transport industry, experts noted. There is no doubt that the US has serious loopholes in the transportation management of hazardous substances, and the relevant error correction mechanism is in fact not effective, which means that this kind of thing will occur in the future, Li Haidong, a professor at the China Foreign Affairs University, told the Global Times on Friday.This shows that the US has been unable to take seriously and overcome serious and major issues affecting public safety and the environment and ecology in the country, Li said. ""It must be said that this is a great irony to the self-proclaimed internal governance of the most advanced country in the world.""Analysts said that the frequent occurrence of similar incidents shows that the error correction mechanism in the US has failed. Apart from this, racism and the proliferation of guns are also clear examples of the failure of error correction mechanisms, experts noted.",WORLD,AMERICAS,"A resident of East Palestine in the state of Ohio, US, angrily points during a town hall meeting held by the US

Greek scholar believes in ‘endless possibilities and vast land’ between China-Greece exchanges,Xu Liuliu,2023-09-14,"Chongqing, Sichuan, Shandong… Stelios Virvidakis expectantly plans his next China tour before a visit by the Global Times at his office in Athens, Greece. The University of Athens professor has grown far busier recently since he and four other Greek scholars launched the Center of Chinese and Greek Ancient Civilizations in February. Over the summer, the center has received two scholars from China who have given lectures on the history of China, and other visiting guests from places like Israel, who offered their views on Chinese medicine and its history, and a lecturer from France with insights in Chinese mathematics and how scholars in ancient China studied the living science.""Students found them to be very interesting and greatly appreciated the lectures,"" Virvidakis told the Global Times. ""Greece and China share so many similarities. So in my opinion, the horizon for our cooperation and exchanges is vast. There are endless possibilities which have not been explored.""Mutual learning Chinese President Xi Jinping replied to a letter from Virvidakis and four other Greek scholars earlier in 2023, extending congratulations over the founding of the Center of Chinese and Greek Ancient Civilizations.Hailing the long history of the Chinese civilization and profound influence of the ancient Greek civilization, Xi said in the letter that more than 2,000 years ago, the two civilizations shone brightly on the two ends of the Eurasian continent, jointly making a fundamental contribution to the evolution of human civilization.Greece's golden era produced many of its great philosophers and literary giants. The era coincided with a period in China in which ""a hundred schools of thought contended with each other"" and flourished together.As early as the 4th century BC, China was known to the Greeks by a beautiful name: Sērikḗ. In the 16th century, Euclid's Elements was introduced into China, paving the way for scientific exchanges between China and the West. The story of Prometheus narrated by Aeschylus was an inspiration to many Chinese revolutionaries. The Republic by Plato and Politics by Aristotle are also among the Greek classics known to have long made a name for themselves in China.In the eyes of Virvidakis, Chinese civilization has always been a culture that attracts people though the language is difficult. However, Chinese art, Chinese painting, Chinese poetry, especially love poems, even detective stories about China, are incredibly fascinating. Chinese director Zhang Yimou, and movies like Farewell My Concubine and Raise the Red Lantern starring Gong Li, are also very popular. Greek archaeologists who are interested in Chinese archeology want to know how China explores the past.In other art forms, the mythology and theater, ""we have tragedy, which is our own tradition. You have Chinese opera with music."" Actors and artists always want to study similarities and look at the differences, which is also the commitment of the center to promoting exchanges and mutual learning between the two civilizations and promoting the development of civilizations in various countries. China also has this appeal because people in the West think ""it's very different, it's exotic, something strange, but then they realize that it's beautiful for them."" So ""they find a lot of aspects that they have not thought about before in order to understand.""

Tiantan, a UNESCO World Heritage Site built in 1420, in Beijing Photo: VCGPhilosophy, a way of life There is a feeling among some people in the West that the Chinese system is different in some ways, said the professor. For instance,the European and American systems place great emphasis on individual rights, but China takes a more holistic approach in which ""harmony, social harmony is more important in sovereign.""""We are not exactly the same and there are also differences. But I don't believe in the so-called clash of civilizations theory that the clash is very deep and we can't live together with our differences,"" he told the Global Times. ""In fact we can live together and have peaceful exchanges. As I said, I don't think there is any danger of Greece threatening China or China occupying Greece.""In February, Virvidakis held a lecture at the center's launching ceremony, titled Philosophy is a Way of Life. Philosophy is not just theory, he said, noting that in ancient Greece and China it didn't mean just making theories about the universe, nature, god, or much of the unknown world. ""It told you how to 'organize' your life to feel happy and achieve harmony with others."" Western philosophy cannot be understood just by itself as there are also Chinese and Indian schools of philosophy among others. ""It is easier to see some similarities in ideas between Confucius and Socrates or Confucius and Aristotle,"" said Virvidakis, explaining why he is so fond of Chinese philosophy, especially Confucius thought. A simple question about what is a good life has a variety of answers in different philosophical theories.  But studying philosophy is practical and a way of life. Modern people don't just derive happiness from materialism. They need art and other emotionally stirring elements in life. In different parts and different cultures of the world,people can share similarities in emotion and sentiment.Virvidakis said that one of the most important reasons for his involving in such studies and exchanges was because ""I'm interested and I want to learn more. I'm a student too. When you are a teacher in your whole life, you're going to be a student.""",ARTS,CULTURE & LEISURE,The University of Athens Photo: VCG,"Reporter, Beijing","Global Times senior reporter, mainly covers the reporting of movies, TV, music and culture news.",43,880,<FreqDist with 16 samples and 473 outcomes>

 The first Saudi ambassador to Palestine Naif bin Bandar Al-Sudairi arrived in the West Bank on Tuesday, the official Palestinian news agency WAFA reported.Leading an official delegation, Al-Sudairi, the non-resident ambassador to Palestine and non-resident consul general in Jerusalem, presented his credentials to Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas at the presidency headquarters in Ramallah, it said.Al-Sudairi's arrival comes amid Israel's efforts to normalize relations with Saudi Arabia.During their meeting, Abbas welcomed Al-Sudairi and said his visit to Palestine and his appointment as Saudi ambassador to the State of Palestine would contribute to ""strengthening the strong fraternal relations that bind the two countries and the two brotherly peoples.""The Saudi ambassador said he hoped that his visit would be ""a successful beginning for strengthening relations in all fields,"" stressing his country's firm and supportive positions for the Palestinian people and their just cause.Earlier in the day, Al-Sudairi told reporters in a statement that ""the Arab Peace Initiative is the basic point in any upcoming agreement,"" after being asked about the fate of the initiative in the event of reaching a normalization deal between Saudi Arabia and Israel.The Arab Peace Initiative was launched in 2002 after it was drafted by Saudi Arabia and adopted by the Arab League.The initiative calls for an end to the conflict between Israel and Palestine and the normalization of relations between Israel and Arab states, in exchange for an Israeli withdrawal from the areas it gained since 1967 and proper settlement to the issue of Palestinian refugees.The Palestinians demanded the establishment of an independent state alongside Israel in all of the Palestinian territories occupied by Israel in 1967, including the entire West Bank and the Gaza Strip, with East Jerusalem as its capital.The Saudi ambassador also confirmed that his country intends to open a consulate in East Jerusalem soon.",PHOTO,WORLD,"Saudi ambassador to Palestine Naif bin Bandar Al-Sudairi (Front) arrives at the Palestinian foreign ministry headquarters in the West Bank city of Ramallah, on Sept. 26, 2023.(Photo: Xinhua)",Author details not found,Author details not found,12,313,<FreqDist with 15 samples and 181 outcomes>
China releases a white paper on its proposals and actions on building a global community of shared future,GT staff reporters,2023-09-26," The Chinese government released a white paper on Tuesday to introduce the theoretical base, practice and development of a global community of shared future, as by presenting China's vision of the course of human development, it counters the hegemonic thinking of certain countries that seek supremacy. The white paper, titled ""A Global Community of Shared Future: China's Proposals and Actions,"" introduced the background for China to raise the concept of a global community of shared future as the world is undergoing changes on a scale unseen in a century with various problems posing unprecedented challenges for human society. The zero-sum game is doomed to fail, the white paper said. But certain countries still cling to this mindset, blindly pursuing absolute security and monopolistic advantages, which will do nothing for their development in the long run but create a major threat to the world. It is increasingly obvious that the obsession with superior strength, and the zero-sum mentality are in conflict with the needs of our times, the white paper said, pointing out that the new era calls for new ideas. To build a global community of shared future is to pursue openness, inclusiveness, mutual benefit, equity and justice, the white paper said. The goal is not to replace one system or civilization with another. Instead, it is about countries with different social systems, ideologies, histories, shared rights, and shared responsibilities in global affairs. The vision of a global community of shared future stands on the right side of history and on the side of human progress. It introduces a new approach for international relations, provides new ideas for global governance, opens up new prospects for international exchanges and draws a new blueprint for a better world, according to the white paper. Such important vision transcends outdated mindsets such as zero-sum game, power politics, and Cold War confrontations. It has become the overall goal of China's major-country diplomacy in the new era, and a great banner that leads the trend of the times and the direction of human progress. The concept of a global community of shared future has deep roots in China's profound cultural heritage and its unique experience of modernization. It carries forward the diplomatic traditions of China and draws on the outstanding achievements of all other civilizations, the white paper said. It also manifests China's time-honored historical traditions, distinct characteristics of the times, and a wealth of humanistic values.  The white paper also pointed out the direction and plan to build a global community of shared future including pressing ahead with a new type of economic globalization in which countries need to pursue a policy of openness and explicitly oppose protectionism, the erection of fences and barriers, unilateral sanctions, and maximum-pressure tactics, so as to connect economies and jointly build an open world economy. Some countries are seeking to decouple from China, enclosing themselves in ""small yards, high fences,"" which will ultimately only backfire, the white paper said. Also, some people overstate the need to ""reduce dependence"" and ""de-risk,"" which is essentially creating new risks. The direction and the plan also include following a peaceful development plan, fostering a new type of international relations, practicing true multilateralism and promoting the common values of humanity. Over the past decade, China has contributed its strength to building a global community of shared future with firm conviction and solid actions. For instance, by July 2023, more than three-quarters of countries in the world and over 30 international organizations had signed agreements on Belt and Road cooperation with China. The BRI originated in China but the opportunities and achievements it creates belong to the whole world. It's an initiative for economic cooperation, not for geopolitical or military alliances, and it's open and inclusive process that neither targets nor excludes any party, the white paper said. Among those BRI projects, for example, the China-Laos Railway began operation on December 3, 2021, with 167 tunnels and 301 bridges built in 11 years along its total length of 1,035 kilometers. The railway construction created more than 110,000 local jobs, and helped build about 2,000 kilometers of roads and canals for villages along the railway, benefiting local people. Besides the BRI, the Global Development Initiative, the Global Security Initiative and Global Civilization Initiative have evolved into a crucial cornerstone for building a global community of shared future, offering China's solutions to major challenges pertaining to peace and development for humanity. Facing constant flare-ups of hotspot issues, China has been committed to fulfilling its role as a responsible major country, pushing for the resolution of international and regional flashpoints, such as the Korean Peninsula, Palestine, the Iranian nuclear issue, Syria and Afghanistan, the white paper said. On the Ukraine issue, China has actively promoted talks for peace, put forth four points, four things that the international community should do together and three observations, and released China's position on the political settlement of the Ukraine crisis and has dispatched the special representative of the Chinese government on Eurasian affairs to engage in extensive interactions and exchanges with stakeholders on the political settlement of the Ukraine crisis. Also, through the mediation of China, Saudi Arabia and Iran achieve historic reconciliation earlier this year, setting a fine example for countries in the region to resolve disputes and differences and achieve good neighborly relations through dialogue and consultation, and catalyzing a wave of reconciliation in the Middle East. China has also proposed a range of regional and bilateral initiatives on building communities of shared future and working with stakeholders to build consensus and expand cooperation, there by playing a constructive role in promoting regional peace and development. It also boosts international cooperation in fields including fighting the COVID-19 pandemic, addressing disorder in cyberspace governance and dealing with the global climate challenge. Over the past decade, the vision of a global community of shared future has gained broader support. More countries and people have come to the understanding that this vision serves the common interests of humanity, represents popular calls for peace, justice and progress, and can create the greatest synergy among all nations for building a better world, the white paper said.",CHINA,POLITICS,Photo: Li Xuanmin/GT,Author details not found,Author details not found,33,1000,<FreqDist with 17 samples and 603 outcomes>

F-35: Closer Look at Colossally Costly Jet That Just Can’t Seem to Stay Airborne,Sputnik,2023-09-21,"A US Marine Corps F-35B went down over South Carolina on Sunday after its pilot ejected mid-flight for reasons unknown. Why do F-35s seem so crash-prone? What’s wrong with them? And what role does the waste and fraud in the US military-industrial complex play in creating such a Frankenstein’s monster of an aircraft? Sputnik explores.Debris from the F-35B that went missing over South Carolina on September 17 was found in Williamsburg County, South Carolina, about two hours northeast of Joint Base Charleston on Monday following more than a day of frantic searching by the military. An as yet unspecified “mishap” was blamed for the accident. The pilot escaped unscathed.“The mishap is currently under investigation, and we are unable to provide additional details to preserve the integrity of the investigative process,” the Marine Corps said in a statement Monday. The Marines ordered a two-day global pause in all aerial operations, with the errant F-35B becoming the third major aviation-related accident suffered by the military branch in less than two months.Air units will be discussing “fundamentals of safe flight operations, ground safety, maintenance and flight procedures, and maintaining combat readiness,” the Marine Corps said.How Many F-35s Have Been Lost?Since it started being introduced into service with the Marines (2015), the US Air Force (2016), and the US Navy (2019) and began to be exported to foreign clients (starting with Israel in 2018), the F-35 has gained an unenviable reputation of being a costly, buggy, and crash-prone jet, with the F-35B that went down over South Carolina last week being at least the 11th Lightning II lost since 2018.On September 28, 2018, a US Marine Corps F-35B crashed during a flight near Marine Corps Air Station Beaufort in South Carolina, with a faulty fuel tube blamed for the incident. The pilot emerged unscathed.On April 9, 2019, a Japanese Self- Defense Force F-35A went down off Honshu, Japan. The pilot was killed after losing his bearings and suffering “special disorientation” mid-flight over the ocean.On May 19, 2020, a US Air Force F-35A from the 58th Fighter Squadron crashed while performing a landing at Eglin Air Force Base in western Florida. Pilot error (trying to land at excessive speed) and a mechanical defect related to a flight control glitch that left the plane’s tail unresponsive were blamed. The pilot survived.On September 29, 2020, a US Marine Corps F-35B was lost over Imperial County, California after colliding with a KC-130 tanker during midflight refueling. The tanker crew managed to bring their aircraft down for a hard landing. The F-35 pilot ejected successfully.On November 17, 2021, a British Royal Air Force F-35B plunged into the Mediterranean Sea after its pilot ejected during routine operations. That crash was ultimately blamed on a protective cover getting wedged into the plane’s engine intake.On January 4, 2022, a South Korean Air Force F-35A suffering from issues with its onboard avionics carried out an emergency belly landing. Investigators blamed a bird striking the warplane’s landing gear mid-flight. The pilot emerged unharmed.On January 24, 2022, a US Navy F-35C plunged into the South China Sea after making a hard landing on the USS Carl Vinson super carrier. The pilot and six sailors on the deck of the aircraft carrier were injured. A Navy investigation attributed the incident to pilot error.On October 19, 2022, another F-35, this one from the US Air Force, crashed at Hill Air Force Base in Utah during a training mission. The pilot ejected safely. It was later determined that turbulent air somehow confused the jet’s onboard avionics to the point where the aircraft became uncontrollable.On December 1, 2022, a Marine Corps F-35B collapsed on a military base in Japan after suffering a landing gear failure during training. No one was injured.Finally, on December 15, 2022, a US Navy F-35B crashed while attempting to perform a vertical landing at Naval Air Station Joint Reserve Base Fort Worth in Texas during testing of the jet’s systems. A “harmonic resonance” issue related to the jet’s Pratt & Whitney F135 engine was blamed, with the Pentagon halting further F-35 deliveries by Lockheed until an investigation was concluded.What’s Wrong With the F-35?Nearly 17 years after the F-35’s first flight, and eight years after its adoption into service, the F-35 continues to maintain a troublingly long list of technical bugs affecting both hardware and software. The aircraft, which has an astronomical total estimated purchase and sustainment price tag of over $1.7 trillion, and a per-plane cost of $70-$90 million, has faced years of harsh criticism from US officials, including former President Donald Trump at one point, who said the jet’s costs had spiraled “out of control.”At its heart, the F-35 is the product of an idea that metastasized in the Pentagon after the end of the Cold War, envisioning an all-in-one fighter platform which could be used by every branch of the military, equipped with vertical take-off and landing capability, and carry out a broad array of missions using a variety of onboard weapons. The do-it-all jet was supposed to replace nearly all of America’s fourth-gen fighter, strike, and ground attack aircraft, including the F-16 Falcon, the F/A-18 Hornet and Super Hornet, the AV-8B Harrier II, and others.The jet features just a single onboard engine – the aforementioned Pratt & Whitney F135, with engine-related troubles not only regularly referred to by watchdogs as a “leading driver” of the F-35’s problems remaining “mission capable,” but also making its operation over enemy territory or over the sea risky, since if something goes wrong, the plane doesn’t have a backup engine to limp home with.Throughout its production cycle, the F-35 Lightning II has suffered a dizzying and seemingly endless list of technical problems, from neck-snapping ejection seats to problems, ironically, while operating in stormy weather.In its 2023 report, the congressional Government Accountability Office revealed that the F-35 program “continues to experience schedule delays, cost growth, and late deliveries,” with procurement costs jumping by $13.4 billion since 2019, and modernization behind schedule and over budget.“As of January 2023, of the 821 open deficiencies, the program office characterized five of these as category 1 [i.e. critical issues which could jeopardize flight safety and security], and 816 as category 2, [i.e. those which could impede or constrain mission success].”In all, between December 2006 and 2023, the GAO has reported a whopping 277 category 1 and 2,467 category 2 deficiencies with the aircraft, among them serious issues like cabin over-pressurization, problems with the jets’ night vision systems, software bugs, radar issues, corrosion, ejection seats which could snap pilots’ necks, etc.Is a Culture of Largess to Blame?Sunday’s accident in South Carolina is the latest piece of F-35-related bad news for Lockheed Martin. In June, it was reported that the Pentagon had halted the delivery of any additional upgraded F-35s until major issues related to new Technology Refresh 3 (TR-3) hardware and weapons-related software were resolved. DoD F-35 program director Mike Schmidt told Congress in March that the risk assessment related to the TR-3 hardware upgrade wouldn’t be finished until April 2024.Despite the delays and array of technical problems, the weapons giant has continued to rack up generous contracts related to F-35 procurement and production. For example, in July, the US Navy ordered a $490 million package of equipment from Lockheed “to procure various material mod kits, special test/tooling equipment, as well as…product engineering” for already delivered, but defective planes. In August, Lockheed received another $606 million “fixed-price incentive (firm-target) undefinitized” contract “for long lead time materials, parts, components, and efforts to support of maintaining on-time production and delivery of 173 Lot 19 F-35 Joint Strike Fighter aircraft for Foreign Military Sales (FMS) customers and non-US Department of Defense (DOD) participants.”The terms of the contracts seem to be the culprit behind the F-35’s soaring costs (and Lockheed’s soaring profits, despite delivery of defective products), with so-called “cost-plus” and “undefinitized” contracts effectively making any overruns the buyer’s problem – i.e. that of US taxpayers, and of citizens of any country unfortunate enough to pen contracts for the planes from Lockheed.What About America’s Competitors?The worst part about the F-35’s troublesome history seems to be that the F-35 has already become ""obsolete"" in the sense that many of the US and NATO’s competitors have obtained the ability to defeat them, with Russia and China gaining capabilities to track and target the jets going back to the mid-to-late 2010s. In April, Iran announced that its engineers had created advanced radar technologies to not only detect F-35s, but identify the radar signature of individual F-35 planes, enabling the Islamic Republic to plan defensive operations accordingly.",WORLD,AMERICAS,Picture description not found,Author details not found,Author details not found,60,1305,<FreqDist with 18 samples and 775 outcomes>
Toxic explosion in Nebraska shows US unable to take issues affecting public security seriously: experts,Xu Yelu,2023-09-15,"Barely two months after an explosion in Louisiana, a train carrying toxic perchloric acid has exploded in a Nebraska rail yard on Thursday, prompting evacuation orders to be issued, as huge plumes are seen engulfing the city. Experts said the incident shows the US has been unable to take seriously and overcome major issues affecting public safety and the environment and ecology in the country.The incident happened on Union Pacific Railroad tracks in the city of North Platte. North Platte Volunteer Fire Department announced that they would order those living in the area to evacuate due to the toxic smoke from the railroad, according to media reports.In a post on social media platforms, it said that ""Emergency evacuation for the area between splinter and front North of railroad track due fire at the railroad involving heavy toxic smoke.""In a statement to DailyMail.com, Union Pacific Railroad said that an explosion occurred inside a container which resulted in several railcars catching fire. The railcar did not derail, the company said, and had been in the yard for several hours.Union Pacific said that one of the containers contained a hazardous chemical called perchloric acid, according to Daily Mail.Perchloric is a hazardous material used in food, drugs and biocidal products, as well as explosives, according to the report.Two months ago, a fire at a Louisiana chemical plant triggered explosions that shook homes several miles away and sent flames and smoke billowing into the air in mid-July, prompting emergency officials to urge a few hundred nearby residents to shelter indoors for several hours and to turn off their air conditioners, the Associated Press reported.Antiquated infrastructure and the outdated transportation were one factor. Another was a flawed system of governance in the US transport industry, experts noted. There is no doubt that the US has serious loopholes in the transportation management of hazardous substances, and the relevant error correction mechanism is in fact not effective, which means that this kind of thing will occur in the future, Li Haidong, a professor at the China Foreign Affairs University, told the Global Times on Friday.This shows that the US has been unable to take seriously and overcome serious and major issues affecting public safety and the environment and ecology in the country, Li said. ""It must be said that this is a great irony to the self-proclaimed internal governance of the most advanced country in the world.""Analysts said that the frequent occurrence of similar incidents shows that the error correction mechanism in the US has failed. Apart from this, racism and the proliferation of guns are also clear examples of the failure of error correction mechanisms, experts noted.",WORLD,AMERICAS,"A resident of East Palestine in the state of Ohio, US, angrily points during a town hall meeting held by the US

Greek scholar believes in ‘endless possibilities and vast land’ between China-Greece exchanges,Xu Liuliu,2023-09-14,"Chongqing, Sichuan, Shandong… Stelios Virvidakis expectantly plans his next China tour before a visit by the Global Times at his office in Athens, Greece. The University of Athens professor has grown far busier recently since he and four other Greek scholars launched the Center of Chinese and Greek Ancient Civilizations in February. Over the summer, the center has received two scholars from China who have given lectures on the history of China, and other visiting guests from places like Israel, who offered their views on Chinese medicine and its history, and a lecturer from France with insights in Chinese mathematics and how scholars in ancient China studied the living science.""Students found them to be very interesting and greatly appreciated the lectures,"" Virvidakis told the Global Times. ""Greece and China share so many similarities. So in my opinion, the horizon for our cooperation and exchanges is vast. There are endless possibilities which have not been explored.""Mutual learning Chinese President Xi Jinping replied to a letter from Virvidakis and four other Greek scholars earlier in 2023, extending congratulations over the founding of the Center of Chinese and Greek Ancient Civilizations.Hailing the long history of the Chinese civilization and profound influence of the ancient Greek civilization, Xi said in the letter that more than 2,000 years ago, the two civilizations shone brightly on the two ends of the Eurasian continent, jointly making a fundamental contribution to the evolution of human civilization.Greece's golden era produced many of its great philosophers and literary giants. The era coincided with a period in China in which ""a hundred schools of thought contended with each other"" and flourished together.As early as the 4th century BC, China was known to the Greeks by a beautiful name: Sērikḗ. In the 16th century, Euclid's Elements was introduced into China, paving the way for scientific exchanges between China and the West. The story of Prometheus narrated by Aeschylus was an inspiration to many Chinese revolutionaries. The Republic by Plato and Politics by Aristotle are also among the Greek classics known to have long made a name for themselves in China.In the eyes of Virvidakis, Chinese civilization has always been a culture that attracts people though the language is difficult. However, Chinese art, Chinese painting, Chinese poetry, especially love poems, even detective stories about China, are incredibly fascinating. Chinese director Zhang Yimou, and movies like Farewell My Concubine and Raise the Red Lantern starring Gong Li, are also very popular. Greek archaeologists who are interested in Chinese archeology want to know how China explores the past.In other art forms, the mythology and theater, ""we have tragedy, which is our own tradition. You have Chinese opera with music."" Actors and artists always want to study similarities and look at the differences, which is also the commitment of the center to promoting exchanges and mutual learning between the two civilizations and promoting the development of civilizations in various countries. China also has this appeal because people in the West think ""it's very different, it's exotic, something strange, but then they realize that it's beautiful for them."" So ""they find a lot of aspects that they have not thought about before in order to understand.""

Tiantan, a UNESCO World Heritage Site built in 1420, in Beijing Photo: VCGPhilosophy, a way of life There is a feeling among some people in the West that the Chinese system is different in some ways, said the professor. For instance,the European and American systems place great emphasis on individual rights, but China takes a more holistic approach in which ""harmony, social harmony is more important in sovereign.""""We are not exactly the same and there are also differences. But I don't believe in the so-called clash of civilizations theory that the clash is very deep and we can't live together with our differences,"" he told the Global Times. ""In fact we can live together and have peaceful exchanges. As I said, I don't think there is any danger of Greece threatening China or China occupying Greece.""In February, Virvidakis held a lecture at the center's launching ceremony, titled Philosophy is a Way of Life. Philosophy is not just theory, he said, noting that in ancient Greece and China it didn't mean just making theories about the universe, nature, god, or much of the unknown world. ""It told you how to 'organize' your life to feel happy and achieve harmony with others."" Western philosophy cannot be understood just by itself as there are also Chinese and Indian schools of philosophy among others. ""It is easier to see some similarities in ideas between Confucius and Socrates or Confucius and Aristotle,"" said Virvidakis, explaining why he is so fond of Chinese philosophy, especially Confucius thought. A simple question about what is a good life has a variety of answers in different philosophical theories.  But studying philosophy is practical and a way of life. Modern people don't just derive happiness from materialism. They need art and other emotionally stirring elements in life. In different parts and different cultures of the world,people can share similarities in emotion and sentiment.Virvidakis said that one of the most important reasons for his involving in such studies and exchanges was because ""I'm interested and I want to learn more. I'm a student too. When you are a teacher in your whole life, you're going to be a student.""",ARTS,CULTURE & LEISURE,The University of Athens Photo: VCG,"Reporter, Beijing","Global Times senior reporter, mainly covers the reporting of movies, TV, music and culture news.",43,880,<FreqDist with 16 samples and 473 outcomes>

 The first Saudi ambassador to Palestine Naif bin Bandar Al-Sudairi arrived in the West Bank on Tuesday, the official Palestinian news agency WAFA reported.Leading an official delegation, Al-Sudairi, the non-resident ambassador to Palestine and non-resident consul general in Jerusalem, presented his credentials to Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas at the presidency headquarters in Ramallah, it said.Al-Sudairi's arrival comes amid Israel's efforts to normalize relations with Saudi Arabia.During their meeting, Abbas welcomed Al-Sudairi and said his visit to Palestine and his appointment as Saudi ambassador to the State of Palestine would contribute to ""strengthening the strong fraternal relations that bind the two countries and the two brotherly peoples.""The Saudi ambassador said he hoped that his visit would be ""a successful beginning for strengthening relations in all fields,"" stressing his country's firm and supportive positions for the Palestinian people and their just cause.Earlier in the day, Al-Sudairi told reporters in a statement that ""the Arab Peace Initiative is the basic point in any upcoming agreement,"" after being asked about the fate of the initiative in the event of reaching a normalization deal between Saudi Arabia and Israel.The Arab Peace Initiative was launched in 2002 after it was drafted by Saudi Arabia and adopted by the Arab League.The initiative calls for an end to the conflict between Israel and Palestine and the normalization of relations between Israel and Arab states, in exchange for an Israeli withdrawal from the areas it gained since 1967 and proper settlement to the issue of Palestinian refugees.The Palestinians demanded the establishment of an independent state alongside Israel in all of the Palestinian territories occupied by Israel in 1967, including the entire West Bank and the Gaza Strip, with East Jerusalem as its capital.The Saudi ambassador also confirmed that his country intends to open a consulate in East Jerusalem soon.",PHOTO,WORLD,"Saudi ambassador to Palestine Naif bin Bandar Al-Sudairi (Front) arrives at the Palestinian foreign ministry headquarters in the West Bank city of Ramallah, on Sept. 26, 2023.(Photo: Xinhua)",Author details not found,Author details not found,12,313,<FreqDist with 15 samples and 181 outcomes>
China releases a white paper on its proposals and actions on building a global community of shared future,GT staff reporters,2023-09-26," The Chinese government released a white paper on Tuesday to introduce the theoretical base, practice and development of a global community of shared future, as by presenting China's vision of the course of human development, it counters the hegemonic thinking of certain countries that seek supremacy. The white paper, titled ""A Global Community of Shared Future: China's Proposals and Actions,"" introduced the background for China to raise the concept of a global community of shared future as the world is undergoing changes on a scale unseen in a century with various problems posing unprecedented challenges for human society. The zero-sum game is doomed to fail, the white paper said. But certain countries still cling to this mindset, blindly pursuing absolute security and monopolistic advantages, which will do nothing for their development in the long run but create a major threat to the world. It is increasingly obvious that the obsession with superior strength, and the zero-sum mentality are in conflict with the needs of our times, the white paper said, pointing out that the new era calls for new ideas. To build a global community of shared future is to pursue openness, inclusiveness, mutual benefit, equity and justice, the white paper said. The goal is not to replace one system or civilization with another. Instead, it is about countries with different social systems, ideologies, histories, shared rights, and shared responsibilities in global affairs. The vision of a global community of shared future stands on the right side of history and on the side of human progress. It introduces a new approach for international relations, provides new ideas for global governance, opens up new prospects for international exchanges and draws a new blueprint for a better world, according to the white paper. Such important vision transcends outdated mindsets such as zero-sum game, power politics, and Cold War confrontations. It has become the overall goal of China's major-country diplomacy in the new era, and a great banner that leads the trend of the times and the direction of human progress. The concept of a global community of shared future has deep roots in China's profound cultural heritage and its unique experience of modernization. It carries forward the diplomatic traditions of China and draws on the outstanding achievements of all other civilizations, the white paper said. It also manifests China's time-honored historical traditions, distinct characteristics of the times, and a wealth of humanistic values.  The white paper also pointed out the direction and plan to build a global community of shared future including pressing ahead with a new type of economic globalization in which countries need to pursue a policy of openness and explicitly oppose protectionism, the erection of fences and barriers, unilateral sanctions, and maximum-pressure tactics, so as to connect economies and jointly build an open world economy. Some countries are seeking to decouple from China, enclosing themselves in ""small yards, high fences,"" which will ultimately only backfire, the white paper said. Also, some people overstate the need to ""reduce dependence"" and ""de-risk,"" which is essentially creating new risks. The direction and the plan also include following a peaceful development plan, fostering a new type of international relations, practicing true multilateralism and promoting the common values of humanity. Over the past decade, China has contributed its strength to building a global community of shared future with firm conviction and solid actions. For instance, by July 2023, more than three-quarters of countries in the world and over 30 international organizations had signed agreements on Belt and Road cooperation with China. The BRI originated in China but the opportunities and achievements it creates belong to the whole world. It's an initiative for economic cooperation, not for geopolitical or military alliances, and it's open and inclusive process that neither targets nor excludes any party, the white paper said. Among those BRI projects, for example, the China-Laos Railway began operation on December 3, 2021, with 167 tunnels and 301 bridges built in 11 years along its total length of 1,035 kilometers. The railway construction created more than 110,000 local jobs, and helped build about 2,000 kilometers of roads and canals for villages along the railway, benefiting local people. Besides the BRI, the Global Development Initiative, the Global Security Initiative and Global Civilization Initiative have evolved into a crucial cornerstone for building a global community of shared future, offering China's solutions to major challenges pertaining to peace and development for humanity. Facing constant flare-ups of hotspot issues, China has been committed to fulfilling its role as a responsible major country, pushing for the resolution of international and regional flashpoints, such as the Korean Peninsula, Palestine, the Iranian nuclear issue, Syria and Afghanistan, the white paper said. On the Ukraine issue, China has actively promoted talks for peace, put forth four points, four things that the international community should do together and three observations, and released China's position on the political settlement of the Ukraine crisis and has dispatched the special representative of the Chinese government on Eurasian affairs to engage in extensive interactions and exchanges with stakeholders on the political settlement of the Ukraine crisis. Also, through the mediation of China, Saudi Arabia and Iran achieve historic reconciliation earlier this year, setting a fine example for countries in the region to resolve disputes and differences and achieve good neighborly relations through dialogue and consultation, and catalyzing a wave of reconciliation in the Middle East. China has also proposed a range of regional and bilateral initiatives on building communities of shared future and working with stakeholders to build consensus and expand cooperation, there by playing a constructive role in promoting regional peace and development. It also boosts international cooperation in fields including fighting the COVID-19 pandemic, addressing disorder in cyberspace governance and dealing with the global climate challenge. Over the past decade, the vision of a global community of shared future has gained broader support. More countries and people have come to the understanding that this vision serves the common interests of humanity, represents popular calls for peace, justice and progress, and can create the greatest synergy among all nations for building a better world, the white paper said.",CHINA,POLITICS,Photo: Li Xuanmin/GT,Author details not found,Author details not found,33,1000,<FreqDist with 17 samples and 603 outcomes>

F-35: Closer Look at Colossally Costly Jet That Just Can’t Seem to Stay Airborne,Sputnik,2023-09-21,"A US Marine Corps F-35B went down over South Carolina on Sunday after its pilot ejected mid-flight for reasons unknown. Why do F-35s seem so crash-prone? What’s wrong with them? And what role does the waste and fraud in the US military-industrial complex play in creating such a Frankenstein’s monster of an aircraft? Sputnik explores.Debris from the F-35B that went missing over South Carolina on September 17 was found in Williamsburg County, South Carolina, about two hours northeast of Joint Base Charleston on Monday following more than a day of frantic searching by the military. An as yet unspecified “mishap” was blamed for the accident. The pilot escaped unscathed.“The mishap is currently under investigation, and we are unable to provide additional details to preserve the integrity of the investigative process,” the Marine Corps said in a statement Monday. The Marines ordered a two-day global pause in all aerial operations, with the errant F-35B becoming the third major aviation-related accident suffered by the military branch in less than two months.Air units will be discussing “fundamentals of safe flight operations, ground safety, maintenance and flight procedures, and maintaining combat readiness,” the Marine Corps said.How Many F-35s Have Been Lost?Since it started being introduced into service with the Marines (2015), the US Air Force (2016), and the US Navy (2019) and began to be exported to foreign clients (starting with Israel in 2018), the F-35 has gained an unenviable reputation of being a costly, buggy, and crash-prone jet, with the F-35B that went down over South Carolina last week being at least the 11th Lightning II lost since 2018.On September 28, 2018, a US Marine Corps F-35B crashed during a flight near Marine Corps Air Station Beaufort in South Carolina, with a faulty fuel tube blamed for the incident. The pilot emerged unscathed.On April 9, 2019, a Japanese Self- Defense Force F-35A went down off Honshu, Japan. The pilot was killed after losing his bearings and suffering “special disorientation” mid-flight over the ocean.On May 19, 2020, a US Air Force F-35A from the 58th Fighter Squadron crashed while performing a landing at Eglin Air Force Base in western Florida. Pilot error (trying to land at excessive speed) and a mechanical defect related to a flight control glitch that left the plane’s tail unresponsive were blamed. The pilot survived.On September 29, 2020, a US Marine Corps F-35B was lost over Imperial County, California after colliding with a KC-130 tanker during midflight refueling. The tanker crew managed to bring their aircraft down for a hard landing. The F-35 pilot ejected successfully.On November 17, 2021, a British Royal Air Force F-35B plunged into the Mediterranean Sea after its pilot ejected during routine operations. That crash was ultimately blamed on a protective cover getting wedged into the plane’s engine intake.On January 4, 2022, a South Korean Air Force F-35A suffering from issues with its onboard avionics carried out an emergency belly landing. Investigators blamed a bird striking the warplane’s landing gear mid-flight. The pilot emerged unharmed.On January 24, 2022, a US Navy F-35C plunged into the South China Sea after making a hard landing on the USS Carl Vinson super carrier. The pilot and six sailors on the deck of the aircraft carrier were injured. A Navy investigation attributed the incident to pilot error.On October 19, 2022, another F-35, this one from the US Air Force, crashed at Hill Air Force Base in Utah during a training mission. The pilot ejected safely. It was later determined that turbulent air somehow confused the jet’s onboard avionics to the point where the aircraft became uncontrollable.On December 1, 2022, a Marine Corps F-35B collapsed on a military base in Japan after suffering a landing gear failure during training. No one was injured.Finally, on December 15, 2022, a US Navy F-35B crashed while attempting to perform a vertical landing at Naval Air Station Joint Reserve Base Fort Worth in Texas during testing of the jet’s systems. A “harmonic resonance” issue related to the jet’s Pratt & Whitney F135 engine was blamed, with the Pentagon halting further F-35 deliveries by Lockheed until an investigation was concluded.What’s Wrong With the F-35?Nearly 17 years after the F-35’s first flight, and eight years after its adoption into service, the F-35 continues to maintain a troublingly long list of technical bugs affecting both hardware and software. The aircraft, which has an astronomical total estimated purchase and sustainment price tag of over $1.7 trillion, and a per-plane cost of $70-$90 million, has faced years of harsh criticism from US officials, including former President Donald Trump at one point, who said the jet’s costs had spiraled “out of control.”At its heart, the F-35 is the product of an idea that metastasized in the Pentagon after the end of the Cold War, envisioning an all-in-one fighter platform which could be used by every branch of the military, equipped with vertical take-off and landing capability, and carry out a broad array of missions using a variety of onboard weapons. The do-it-all jet was supposed to replace nearly all of America’s fourth-gen fighter, strike, and ground attack aircraft, including the F-16 Falcon, the F/A-18 Hornet and Super Hornet, the AV-8B Harrier II, and others.The jet features just a single onboard engine – the aforementioned Pratt & Whitney F135, with engine-related troubles not only regularly referred to by watchdogs as a “leading driver” of the F-35’s problems remaining “mission capable,” but also making its operation over enemy territory or over the sea risky, since if something goes wrong, the plane doesn’t have a backup engine to limp home with.Throughout its production cycle, the F-35 Lightning II has suffered a dizzying and seemingly endless list of technical problems, from neck-snapping ejection seats to problems, ironically, while operating in stormy weather.In its 2023 report, the congressional Government Accountability Office revealed that the F-35 program “continues to experience schedule delays, cost growth, and late deliveries,” with procurement costs jumping by $13.4 billion since 2019, and modernization behind schedule and over budget.“As of January 2023, of the 821 open deficiencies, the program office characterized five of these as category 1 [i.e. critical issues which could jeopardize flight safety and security], and 816 as category 2, [i.e. those which could impede or constrain mission success].”In all, between December 2006 and 2023, the GAO has reported a whopping 277 category 1 and 2,467 category 2 deficiencies with the aircraft, among them serious issues like cabin over-pressurization, problems with the jets’ night vision systems, software bugs, radar issues, corrosion, ejection seats which could snap pilots’ necks, etc.Is a Culture of Largess to Blame?Sunday’s accident in South Carolina is the latest piece of F-35-related bad news for Lockheed Martin. In June, it was reported that the Pentagon had halted the delivery of any additional upgraded F-35s until major issues related to new Technology Refresh 3 (TR-3) hardware and weapons-related software were resolved. DoD F-35 program director Mike Schmidt told Congress in March that the risk assessment related to the TR-3 hardware upgrade wouldn’t be finished until April 2024.Despite the delays and array of technical problems, the weapons giant has continued to rack up generous contracts related to F-35 procurement and production. For example, in July, the US Navy ordered a $490 million package of equipment from Lockheed “to procure various material mod kits, special test/tooling equipment, as well as…product engineering” for already delivered, but defective planes. In August, Lockheed received another $606 million “fixed-price incentive (firm-target) undefinitized” contract “for long lead time materials, parts, components, and efforts to support of maintaining on-time production and delivery of 173 Lot 19 F-35 Joint Strike Fighter aircraft for Foreign Military Sales (FMS) customers and non-US Department of Defense (DOD) participants.”The terms of the contracts seem to be the culprit behind the F-35’s soaring costs (and Lockheed’s soaring profits, despite delivery of defective products), with so-called “cost-plus” and “undefinitized” contracts effectively making any overruns the buyer’s problem – i.e. that of US taxpayers, and of citizens of any country unfortunate enough to pen contracts for the planes from Lockheed.What About America’s Competitors?The worst part about the F-35’s troublesome history seems to be that the F-35 has already become ""obsolete"" in the sense that many of the US and NATO’s competitors have obtained the ability to defeat them, with Russia and China gaining capabilities to track and target the jets going back to the mid-to-late 2010s. In April, Iran announced that its engineers had created advanced radar technologies to not only detect F-35s, but identify the radar signature of individual F-35 planes, enabling the Islamic Republic to plan defensive operations accordingly.",WORLD,AMERICAS,Picture description not found,Author details not found,Author details not found,60,1305,<FreqDist with 18 samples and 775 outcomes>
Toxic explosion in Nebraska shows US unable to take issues affecting public security seriously: experts,Xu Yelu,2023-09-15,"Barely two months after an explosion in Louisiana, a train carrying toxic perchloric acid has exploded in a Nebraska rail yard on Thursday, prompting evacuation orders to be issued, as huge plumes are seen engulfing the city. Experts said the incident shows the US has been unable to take seriously and overcome major issues affecting public safety and the environment and ecology in the country.The incident happened on Union Pacific Railroad tracks in the city of North Platte. North Platte Volunteer Fire Department announced that they would order those living in the area to evacuate due to the toxic smoke from the railroad, according to media reports.In a post on social media platforms, it said that ""Emergency evacuation for the area between splinter and front North of railroad track due fire at the railroad involving heavy toxic smoke.""In a statement to DailyMail.com, Union Pacific Railroad said that an explosion occurred inside a container which resulted in several railcars catching fire. The railcar did not derail, the company said, and had been in the yard for several hours.Union Pacific said that one of the containers contained a hazardous chemical called perchloric acid, according to Daily Mail.Perchloric is a hazardous material used in food, drugs and biocidal products, as well as explosives, according to the report.Two months ago, a fire at a Louisiana chemical plant triggered explosions that shook homes several miles away and sent flames and smoke billowing into the air in mid-July, prompting emergency officials to urge a few hundred nearby residents to shelter indoors for several hours and to turn off their air conditioners, the Associated Press reported.Antiquated infrastructure and the outdated transportation were one factor. Another was a flawed system of governance in the US transport industry, experts noted. There is no doubt that the US has serious loopholes in the transportation management of hazardous substances, and the relevant error correction mechanism is in fact not effective, which means that this kind of thing will occur in the future, Li Haidong, a professor at the China Foreign Affairs University, told the Global Times on Friday.This shows that the US has been unable to take seriously and overcome serious and major issues affecting public safety and the environment and ecology in the country, Li said. ""It must be said that this is a great irony to the self-proclaimed internal governance of the most advanced country in the world.""Analysts said that the frequent occurrence of similar incidents shows that the error correction mechanism in the US has failed. Apart from this, racism and the proliferation of guns are also clear examples of the failure of error correction mechanisms, experts noted.",WORLD,AMERICAS,"A resident of East Palestine in the state of Ohio, US, angrily points during a town hall meeting held by the US

Greek scholar believes in ‘endless possibilities and vast land’ between China-Greece exchanges,Xu Liuliu,2023-09-14,"Chongqing, Sichuan, Shandong… Stelios Virvidakis expectantly plans his next China tour before a visit by the Global Times at his office in Athens, Greece. The University of Athens professor has grown far busier recently since he and four other Greek scholars launched the Center of Chinese and Greek Ancient Civilizations in February. Over the summer, the center has received two scholars from China who have given lectures on the history of China, and other visiting guests from places like Israel, who offered their views on Chinese medicine and its history, and a lecturer from France with insights in Chinese mathematics and how scholars in ancient China studied the living science.""Students found them to be very interesting and greatly appreciated the lectures,"" Virvidakis told the Global Times. ""Greece and China share so many similarities. So in my opinion, the horizon for our cooperation and exchanges is vast. There are endless possibilities which have not been explored.""Mutual learning Chinese President Xi Jinping replied to a letter from Virvidakis and four other Greek scholars earlier in 2023, extending congratulations over the founding of the Center of Chinese and Greek Ancient Civilizations.Hailing the long history of the Chinese civilization and profound influence of the ancient Greek civilization, Xi said in the letter that more than 2,000 years ago, the two civilizations shone brightly on the two ends of the Eurasian continent, jointly making a fundamental contribution to the evolution of human civilization.Greece's golden era produced many of its great philosophers and literary giants. The era coincided with a period in China in which ""a hundred schools of thought contended with each other"" and flourished together.As early as the 4th century BC, China was known to the Greeks by a beautiful name: Sērikḗ. In the 16th century, Euclid's Elements was introduced into China, paving the way for scientific exchanges between China and the West. The story of Prometheus narrated by Aeschylus was an inspiration to many Chinese revolutionaries. The Republic by Plato and Politics by Aristotle are also among the Greek classics known to have long made a name for themselves in China.In the eyes of Virvidakis, Chinese civilization has always been a culture that attracts people though the language is difficult. However, Chinese art, Chinese painting, Chinese poetry, especially love poems, even detective stories about China, are incredibly fascinating. Chinese director Zhang Yimou, and movies like Farewell My Concubine and Raise the Red Lantern starring Gong Li, are also very popular. Greek archaeologists who are interested in Chinese archeology want to know how China explores the past.In other art forms, the mythology and theater, ""we have tragedy, which is our own tradition. You have Chinese opera with music."" Actors and artists always want to study similarities and look at the differences, which is also the commitment of the center to promoting exchanges and mutual learning between the two civilizations and promoting the development of civilizations in various countries. China also has this appeal because people in the West think ""it's very different, it's exotic, something strange, but then they realize that it's beautiful for them."" So ""they find a lot of aspects that they have not thought about before in order to understand.""

Tiantan, a UNESCO World Heritage Site built in 1420, in Beijing Photo: VCGPhilosophy, a way of life There is a feeling among some people in the West that the Chinese system is different in some ways, said the professor. For instance,the European and American systems place great emphasis on individual rights, but China takes a more holistic approach in which ""harmony, social harmony is more important in sovereign.""""We are not exactly the same and there are also differences. But I don't believe in the so-called clash of civilizations theory that the clash is very deep and we can't live together with our differences,"" he told the Global Times. ""In fact we can live together and have peaceful exchanges. As I said, I don't think there is any danger of Greece threatening China or China occupying Greece.""In February, Virvidakis held a lecture at the center's launching ceremony, titled Philosophy is a Way of Life. Philosophy is not just theory, he said, noting that in ancient Greece and China it didn't mean just making theories about the universe, nature, god, or much of the unknown world. ""It told you how to 'organize' your life to feel happy and achieve harmony with others."" Western philosophy cannot be understood just by itself as there are also Chinese and Indian schools of philosophy among others. ""It is easier to see some similarities in ideas between Confucius and Socrates or Confucius and Aristotle,"" said Virvidakis, explaining why he is so fond of Chinese philosophy, especially Confucius thought. A simple question about what is a good life has a variety of answers in different philosophical theories.  But studying philosophy is practical and a way of life. Modern people don't just derive happiness from materialism. They need art and other emotionally stirring elements in life. In different parts and different cultures of the world,people can share similarities in emotion and sentiment.Virvidakis said that one of the most important reasons for his involving in such studies and exchanges was because ""I'm interested and I want to learn more. I'm a student too. When you are a teacher in your whole life, you're going to be a student.""",ARTS,CULTURE & LEISURE,The University of Athens Photo: VCG,"Reporter, Beijing","Global Times senior reporter, mainly covers the reporting of movies, TV, music and culture news.",43,880,<FreqDist with 16 samples and 473 outcomes>

 The first Saudi ambassador to Palestine Naif bin Bandar Al-Sudairi arrived in the West Bank on Tuesday, the official Palestinian news agency WAFA reported.Leading an official delegation, Al-Sudairi, the non-resident ambassador to Palestine and non-resident consul general in Jerusalem, presented his credentials to Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas at the presidency headquarters in Ramallah, it said.Al-Sudairi's arrival comes amid Israel's efforts to normalize relations with Saudi Arabia.During their meeting, Abbas welcomed Al-Sudairi and said his visit to Palestine and his appointment as Saudi ambassador to the State of Palestine would contribute to ""strengthening the strong fraternal relations that bind the two countries and the two brotherly peoples.""The Saudi ambassador said he hoped that his visit would be ""a successful beginning for strengthening relations in all fields,"" stressing his country's firm and supportive positions for the Palestinian people and their just cause.Earlier in the day, Al-Sudairi told reporters in a statement that ""the Arab Peace Initiative is the basic point in any upcoming agreement,"" after being asked about the fate of the initiative in the event of reaching a normalization deal between Saudi Arabia and Israel.The Arab Peace Initiative was launched in 2002 after it was drafted by Saudi Arabia and adopted by the Arab League.The initiative calls for an end to the conflict between Israel and Palestine and the normalization of relations between Israel and Arab states, in exchange for an Israeli withdrawal from the areas it gained since 1967 and proper settlement to the issue of Palestinian refugees.The Palestinians demanded the establishment of an independent state alongside Israel in all of the Palestinian territories occupied by Israel in 1967, including the entire West Bank and the Gaza Strip, with East Jerusalem as its capital.The Saudi ambassador also confirmed that his country intends to open a consulate in East Jerusalem soon.",PHOTO,WORLD,"Saudi ambassador to Palestine Naif bin Bandar Al-Sudairi (Front) arrives at the Palestinian foreign ministry headquarters in the West Bank city of Ramallah, on Sept. 26, 2023.(Photo: Xinhua)",Author details not found,Author details not found,12,313,<FreqDist with 15 samples and 181 outcomes>
China releases a white paper on its proposals and actions on building a global community of shared future,GT staff reporters,2023-09-26," The Chinese government released a white paper on Tuesday to introduce the theoretical base, practice and development of a global community of shared future, as by presenting China's vision of the course of human development, it counters the hegemonic thinking of certain countries that seek supremacy. The white paper, titled ""A Global Community of Shared Future: China's Proposals and Actions,"" introduced the background for China to raise the concept of a global community of shared future as the world is undergoing changes on a scale unseen in a century with various problems posing unprecedented challenges for human society. The zero-sum game is doomed to fail, the white paper said. But certain countries still cling to this mindset, blindly pursuing absolute security and monopolistic advantages, which will do nothing for their development in the long run but create a major threat to the world. It is increasingly obvious that the obsession with superior strength, and the zero-sum mentality are in conflict with the needs of our times, the white paper said, pointing out that the new era calls for new ideas. To build a global community of shared future is to pursue openness, inclusiveness, mutual benefit, equity and justice, the white paper said. The goal is not to replace one system or civilization with another. Instead, it is about countries with different social systems, ideologies, histories, shared rights, and shared responsibilities in global affairs. The vision of a global community of shared future stands on the right side of history and on the side of human progress. It introduces a new approach for international relations, provides new ideas for global governance, opens up new prospects for international exchanges and draws a new blueprint for a better world, according to the white paper. Such important vision transcends outdated mindsets such as zero-sum game, power politics, and Cold War confrontations. It has become the overall goal of China's major-country diplomacy in the new era, and a great banner that leads the trend of the times and the direction of human progress. The concept of a global community of shared future has deep roots in China's profound cultural heritage and its unique experience of modernization. It carries forward the diplomatic traditions of China and draws on the outstanding achievements of all other civilizations, the white paper said. It also manifests China's time-honored historical traditions, distinct characteristics of the times, and a wealth of humanistic values.  The white paper also pointed out the direction and plan to build a global community of shared future including pressing ahead with a new type of economic globalization in which countries need to pursue a policy of openness and explicitly oppose protectionism, the erection of fences and barriers, unilateral sanctions, and maximum-pressure tactics, so as to connect economies and jointly build an open world economy. Some countries are seeking to decouple from China, enclosing themselves in ""small yards, high fences,"" which will ultimately only backfire, the white paper said. Also, some people overstate the need to ""reduce dependence"" and ""de-risk,"" which is essentially creating new risks. The direction and the plan also include following a peaceful development plan, fostering a new type of international relations, practicing true multilateralism and promoting the common values of humanity. Over the past decade, China has contributed its strength to building a global community of shared future with firm conviction and solid actions. For instance, by July 2023, more than three-quarters of countries in the world and over 30 international organizations had signed agreements on Belt and Road cooperation with China. The BRI originated in China but the opportunities and achievements it creates belong to the whole world. It's an initiative for economic cooperation, not for geopolitical or military alliances, and it's open and inclusive process that neither targets nor excludes any party, the white paper said. Among those BRI projects, for example, the China-Laos Railway began operation on December 3, 2021, with 167 tunnels and 301 bridges built in 11 years along its total length of 1,035 kilometers. The railway construction created more than 110,000 local jobs, and helped build about 2,000 kilometers of roads and canals for villages along the railway, benefiting local people. Besides the BRI, the Global Development Initiative, the Global Security Initiative and Global Civilization Initiative have evolved into a crucial cornerstone for building a global community of shared future, offering China's solutions to major challenges pertaining to peace and development for humanity. Facing constant flare-ups of hotspot issues, China has been committed to fulfilling its role as a responsible major country, pushing for the resolution of international and regional flashpoints, such as the Korean Peninsula, Palestine, the Iranian nuclear issue, Syria and Afghanistan, the white paper said. On the Ukraine issue, China has actively promoted talks for peace, put forth four points, four things that the international community should do together and three observations, and released China's position on the political settlement of the Ukraine crisis and has dispatched the special representative of the Chinese government on Eurasian affairs to engage in extensive interactions and exchanges with stakeholders on the political settlement of the Ukraine crisis. Also, through the mediation of China, Saudi Arabia and Iran achieve historic reconciliation earlier this year, setting a fine example for countries in the region to resolve disputes and differences and achieve good neighborly relations through dialogue and consultation, and catalyzing a wave of reconciliation in the Middle East. China has also proposed a range of regional and bilateral initiatives on building communities of shared future and working with stakeholders to build consensus and expand cooperation, there by playing a constructive role in promoting regional peace and development. It also boosts international cooperation in fields including fighting the COVID-19 pandemic, addressing disorder in cyberspace governance and dealing with the global climate challenge. Over the past decade, the vision of a global community of shared future has gained broader support. More countries and people have come to the understanding that this vision serves the common interests of humanity, represents popular calls for peace, justice and progress, and can create the greatest synergy among all nations for building a better world, the white paper said.",CHINA,POLITICS,Photo: Li Xuanmin/GT,Author details not found,Author details not found,33,1000,<FreqDist with 17 samples and 603 outcomes>

F-35: Closer Look at Colossally Costly Jet That Just Can’t Seem to Stay Airborne,Sputnik,2023-09-21,"A US Marine Corps F-35B went down over South Carolina on Sunday after its pilot ejected mid-flight for reasons unknown. Why do F-35s seem so crash-prone? What’s wrong with them? And what role does the waste and fraud in the US military-industrial complex play in creating such a Frankenstein’s monster of an aircraft? Sputnik explores.Debris from the F-35B that went missing over South Carolina on September 17 was found in Williamsburg County, South Carolina, about two hours northeast of Joint Base Charleston on Monday following more than a day of frantic searching by the military. An as yet unspecified “mishap” was blamed for the accident. The pilot escaped unscathed.“The mishap is currently under investigation, and we are unable to provide additional details to preserve the integrity of the investigative process,” the Marine Corps said in a statement Monday. The Marines ordered a two-day global pause in all aerial operations, with the errant F-35B becoming the third major aviation-related accident suffered by the military branch in less than two months.Air units will be discussing “fundamentals of safe flight operations, ground safety, maintenance and flight procedures, and maintaining combat readiness,” the Marine Corps said.How Many F-35s Have Been Lost?Since it started being introduced into service with the Marines (2015), the US Air Force (2016), and the US Navy (2019) and began to be exported to foreign clients (starting with Israel in 2018), the F-35 has gained an unenviable reputation of being a costly, buggy, and crash-prone jet, with the F-35B that went down over South Carolina last week being at least the 11th Lightning II lost since 2018.On September 28, 2018, a US Marine Corps F-35B crashed during a flight near Marine Corps Air Station Beaufort in South Carolina, with a faulty fuel tube blamed for the incident. The pilot emerged unscathed.On April 9, 2019, a Japanese Self- Defense Force F-35A went down off Honshu, Japan. The pilot was killed after losing his bearings and suffering “special disorientation” mid-flight over the ocean.On May 19, 2020, a US Air Force F-35A from the 58th Fighter Squadron crashed while performing a landing at Eglin Air Force Base in western Florida. Pilot error (trying to land at excessive speed) and a mechanical defect related to a flight control glitch that left the plane’s tail unresponsive were blamed. The pilot survived.On September 29, 2020, a US Marine Corps F-35B was lost over Imperial County, California after colliding with a KC-130 tanker during midflight refueling. The tanker crew managed to bring their aircraft down for a hard landing. The F-35 pilot ejected successfully.On November 17, 2021, a British Royal Air Force F-35B plunged into the Mediterranean Sea after its pilot ejected during routine operations. That crash was ultimately blamed on a protective cover getting wedged into the plane’s engine intake.On January 4, 2022, a South Korean Air Force F-35A suffering from issues with its onboard avionics carried out an emergency belly landing. Investigators blamed a bird striking the warplane’s landing gear mid-flight. The pilot emerged unharmed.On January 24, 2022, a US Navy F-35C plunged into the South China Sea after making a hard landing on the USS Carl Vinson super carrier. The pilot and six sailors on the deck of the aircraft carrier were injured. A Navy investigation attributed the incident to pilot error.On October 19, 2022, another F-35, this one from the US Air Force, crashed at Hill Air Force Base in Utah during a training mission. The pilot ejected safely. It was later determined that turbulent air somehow confused the jet’s onboard avionics to the point where the aircraft became uncontrollable.On December 1, 2022, a Marine Corps F-35B collapsed on a military base in Japan after suffering a landing gear failure during training. No one was injured.Finally, on December 15, 2022, a US Navy F-35B crashed while attempting to perform a vertical landing at Naval Air Station Joint Reserve Base Fort Worth in Texas during testing of the jet’s systems. A “harmonic resonance” issue related to the jet’s Pratt & Whitney F135 engine was blamed, with the Pentagon halting further F-35 deliveries by Lockheed until an investigation was concluded.What’s Wrong With the F-35?Nearly 17 years after the F-35’s first flight, and eight years after its adoption into service, the F-35 continues to maintain a troublingly long list of technical bugs affecting both hardware and software. The aircraft, which has an astronomical total estimated purchase and sustainment price tag of over $1.7 trillion, and a per-plane cost of $70-$90 million, has faced years of harsh criticism from US officials, including former President Donald Trump at one point, who said the jet’s costs had spiraled “out of control.”At its heart, the F-35 is the product of an idea that metastasized in the Pentagon after the end of the Cold War, envisioning an all-in-one fighter platform which could be used by every branch of the military, equipped with vertical take-off and landing capability, and carry out a broad array of missions using a variety of onboard weapons. The do-it-all jet was supposed to replace nearly all of America’s fourth-gen fighter, strike, and ground attack aircraft, including the F-16 Falcon, the F/A-18 Hornet and Super Hornet, the AV-8B Harrier II, and others.The jet features just a single onboard engine – the aforementioned Pratt & Whitney F135, with engine-related troubles not only regularly referred to by watchdogs as a “leading driver” of the F-35’s problems remaining “mission capable,” but also making its operation over enemy territory or over the sea risky, since if something goes wrong, the plane doesn’t have a backup engine to limp home with.Throughout its production cycle, the F-35 Lightning II has suffered a dizzying and seemingly endless list of technical problems, from neck-snapping ejection seats to problems, ironically, while operating in stormy weather.In its 2023 report, the congressional Government Accountability Office revealed that the F-35 program “continues to experience schedule delays, cost growth, and late deliveries,” with procurement costs jumping by $13.4 billion since 2019, and modernization behind schedule and over budget.“As of January 2023, of the 821 open deficiencies, the program office characterized five of these as category 1 [i.e. critical issues which could jeopardize flight safety and security], and 816 as category 2, [i.e. those which could impede or constrain mission success].”In all, between December 2006 and 2023, the GAO has reported a whopping 277 category 1 and 2,467 category 2 deficiencies with the aircraft, among them serious issues like cabin over-pressurization, problems with the jets’ night vision systems, software bugs, radar issues, corrosion, ejection seats which could snap pilots’ necks, etc.Is a Culture of Largess to Blame?Sunday’s accident in South Carolina is the latest piece of F-35-related bad news for Lockheed Martin. In June, it was reported that the Pentagon had halted the delivery of any additional upgraded F-35s until major issues related to new Technology Refresh 3 (TR-3) hardware and weapons-related software were resolved. DoD F-35 program director Mike Schmidt told Congress in March that the risk assessment related to the TR-3 hardware upgrade wouldn’t be finished until April 2024.Despite the delays and array of technical problems, the weapons giant has continued to rack up generous contracts related to F-35 procurement and production. For example, in July, the US Navy ordered a $490 million package of equipment from Lockheed “to procure various material mod kits, special test/tooling equipment, as well as…product engineering” for already delivered, but defective planes. In August, Lockheed received another $606 million “fixed-price incentive (firm-target) undefinitized” contract “for long lead time materials, parts, components, and efforts to support of maintaining on-time production and delivery of 173 Lot 19 F-35 Joint Strike Fighter aircraft for Foreign Military Sales (FMS) customers and non-US Department of Defense (DOD) participants.”The terms of the contracts seem to be the culprit behind the F-35’s soaring costs (and Lockheed’s soaring profits, despite delivery of defective products), with so-called “cost-plus” and “undefinitized” contracts effectively making any overruns the buyer’s problem – i.e. that of US taxpayers, and of citizens of any country unfortunate enough to pen contracts for the planes from Lockheed.What About America’s Competitors?The worst part about the F-35’s troublesome history seems to be that the F-35 has already become ""obsolete"" in the sense that many of the US and NATO’s competitors have obtained the ability to defeat them, with Russia and China gaining capabilities to track and target the jets going back to the mid-to-late 2010s. In April, Iran announced that its engineers had created advanced radar technologies to not only detect F-35s, but identify the radar signature of individual F-35 planes, enabling the Islamic Republic to plan defensive operations accordingly.",WORLD,AMERICAS,Picture description not found,Author details not found,Author details not found,60,1305,<FreqDist with 18 samples and 775 outcomes>
Toxic explosion in Nebraska shows US unable to take issues affecting public security seriously: experts,Xu Yelu,2023-09-15,"Barely two months after an explosion in Louisiana, a train carrying toxic perchloric acid has exploded in a Nebraska rail yard on Thursday, prompting evacuation orders to be issued, as huge plumes are seen engulfing the city. Experts said the incident shows the US has been unable to take seriously and overcome major issues affecting public safety and the environment and ecology in the country.The incident happened on Union Pacific Railroad tracks in the city of North Platte. North Platte Volunteer Fire Department announced that they would order those living in the area to evacuate due to the toxic smoke from the railroad, according to media reports.In a post on social media platforms, it said that ""Emergency evacuation for the area between splinter and front North of railroad track due fire at the railroad involving heavy toxic smoke.""In a statement to DailyMail.com, Union Pacific Railroad said that an explosion occurred inside a container which resulted in several railcars catching fire. The railcar did not derail, the company said, and had been in the yard for several hours.Union Pacific said that one of the containers contained a hazardous chemical called perchloric acid, according to Daily Mail.Perchloric is a hazardous material used in food, drugs and biocidal products, as well as explosives, according to the report.Two months ago, a fire at a Louisiana chemical plant triggered explosions that shook homes several miles away and sent flames and smoke billowing into the air in mid-July, prompting emergency officials to urge a few hundred nearby residents to shelter indoors for several hours and to turn off their air conditioners, the Associated Press reported.Antiquated infrastructure and the outdated transportation were one factor. Another was a flawed system of governance in the US transport industry, experts noted. There is no doubt that the US has serious loopholes in the transportation management of hazardous substances, and the relevant error correction mechanism is in fact not effective, which means that this kind of thing will occur in the future, Li Haidong, a professor at the China Foreign Affairs University, told the Global Times on Friday.This shows that the US has been unable to take seriously and overcome serious and major issues affecting public safety and the environment and ecology in the country, Li said. ""It must be said that this is a great irony to the self-proclaimed internal governance of the most advanced country in the world.""Analysts said that the frequent occurrence of similar incidents shows that the error correction mechanism in the US has failed. Apart from this, racism and the proliferation of guns are also clear examples of the failure of error correction mechanisms, experts noted.",WORLD,AMERICAS,"A resident of East Palestine in the state of Ohio, US, angrily points during a town hall meeting held by the US

Greek scholar believes in ‘endless possibilities and vast land’ between China-Greece exchanges,Xu Liuliu,2023-09-14,"Chongqing, Sichuan, Shandong… Stelios Virvidakis expectantly plans his next China tour before a visit by the Global Times at his office in Athens, Greece. The University of Athens professor has grown far busier recently since he and four other Greek scholars launched the Center of Chinese and Greek Ancient Civilizations in February. Over the summer, the center has received two scholars from China who have given lectures on the history of China, and other visiting guests from places like Israel, who offered their views on Chinese medicine and its history, and a lecturer from France with insights in Chinese mathematics and how scholars in ancient China studied the living science.""Students found them to be very interesting and greatly appreciated the lectures,"" Virvidakis told the Global Times. ""Greece and China share so many similarities. So in my opinion, the horizon for our cooperation and exchanges is vast. There are endless possibilities which have not been explored.""Mutual learning Chinese President Xi Jinping replied to a letter from Virvidakis and four other Greek scholars earlier in 2023, extending congratulations over the founding of the Center of Chinese and Greek Ancient Civilizations.Hailing the long history of the Chinese civilization and profound influence of the ancient Greek civilization, Xi said in the letter that more than 2,000 years ago, the two civilizations shone brightly on the two ends of the Eurasian continent, jointly making a fundamental contribution to the evolution of human civilization.Greece's golden era produced many of its great philosophers and literary giants. The era coincided with a period in China in which ""a hundred schools of thought contended with each other"" and flourished together.As early as the 4th century BC, China was known to the Greeks by a beautiful name: Sērikḗ. In the 16th century, Euclid's Elements was introduced into China, paving the way for scientific exchanges between China and the West. The story of Prometheus narrated by Aeschylus was an inspiration to many Chinese revolutionaries. The Republic by Plato and Politics by Aristotle are also among the Greek classics known to have long made a name for themselves in China.In the eyes of Virvidakis, Chinese civilization has always been a culture that attracts people though the language is difficult. However, Chinese art, Chinese painting, Chinese poetry, especially love poems, even detective stories about China, are incredibly fascinating. Chinese director Zhang Yimou, and movies like Farewell My Concubine and Raise the Red Lantern starring Gong Li, are also very popular. Greek archaeologists who are interested in Chinese archeology want to know how China explores the past.In other art forms, the mythology and theater, ""we have tragedy, which is our own tradition. You have Chinese opera with music."" Actors and artists always want to study similarities and look at the differences, which is also the commitment of the center to promoting exchanges and mutual learning between the two civilizations and promoting the development of civilizations in various countries. China also has this appeal because people in the West think ""it's very different, it's exotic, something strange, but then they realize that it's beautiful for them."" So ""they find a lot of aspects that they have not thought about before in order to understand.""

Tiantan, a UNESCO World Heritage Site built in 1420, in Beijing Photo: VCGPhilosophy, a way of life There is a feeling among some people in the West that the Chinese system is different in some ways, said the professor. For instance,the European and American systems place great emphasis on individual rights, but China takes a more holistic approach in which ""harmony, social harmony is more important in sovereign.""""We are not exactly the same and there are also differences. But I don't believe in the so-called clash of civilizations theory that the clash is very deep and we can't live together with our differences,"" he told the Global Times. ""In fact we can live together and have peaceful exchanges. As I said, I don't think there is any danger of Greece threatening China or China occupying Greece.""In February, Virvidakis held a lecture at the center's launching ceremony, titled Philosophy is a Way of Life. Philosophy is not just theory, he said, noting that in ancient Greece and China it didn't mean just making theories about the universe, nature, god, or much of the unknown world. ""It told you how to 'organize' your life to feel happy and achieve harmony with others."" Western philosophy cannot be understood just by itself as there are also Chinese and Indian schools of philosophy among others. ""It is easier to see some similarities in ideas between Confucius and Socrates or Confucius and Aristotle,"" said Virvidakis, explaining why he is so fond of Chinese philosophy, especially Confucius thought. A simple question about what is a good life has a variety of answers in different philosophical theories.  But studying philosophy is practical and a way of life. Modern people don't just derive happiness from materialism. They need art and other emotionally stirring elements in life. In different parts and different cultures of the world,people can share similarities in emotion and sentiment.Virvidakis said that one of the most important reasons for his involving in such studies and exchanges was because ""I'm interested and I want to learn more. I'm a student too. When you are a teacher in your whole life, you're going to be a student.""",ARTS,CULTURE & LEISURE,The University of Athens Photo: VCG,"Reporter, Beijing","Global Times senior reporter, mainly covers the reporting of movies, TV, music and culture news.",43,880,<FreqDist with 16 samples and 473 outcomes>

 The first Saudi ambassador to Palestine Naif bin Bandar Al-Sudairi arrived in the West Bank on Tuesday, the official Palestinian news agency WAFA reported.Leading an official delegation, Al-Sudairi, the non-resident ambassador to Palestine and non-resident consul general in Jerusalem, presented his credentials to Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas at the presidency headquarters in Ramallah, it said.Al-Sudairi's arrival comes amid Israel's efforts to normalize relations with Saudi Arabia.During their meeting, Abbas welcomed Al-Sudairi and said his visit to Palestine and his appointment as Saudi ambassador to the State of Palestine would contribute to ""strengthening the strong fraternal relations that bind the two countries and the two brotherly peoples.""The Saudi ambassador said he hoped that his visit would be ""a successful beginning for strengthening relations in all fields,"" stressing his country's firm and supportive positions for the Palestinian people and their just cause.Earlier in the day, Al-Sudairi told reporters in a statement that ""the Arab Peace Initiative is the basic point in any upcoming agreement,"" after being asked about the fate of the initiative in the event of reaching a normalization deal between Saudi Arabia and Israel.The Arab Peace Initiative was launched in 2002 after it was drafted by Saudi Arabia and adopted by the Arab League.The initiative calls for an end to the conflict between Israel and Palestine and the normalization of relations between Israel and Arab states, in exchange for an Israeli withdrawal from the areas it gained since 1967 and proper settlement to the issue of Palestinian refugees.The Palestinians demanded the establishment of an independent state alongside Israel in all of the Palestinian territories occupied by Israel in 1967, including the entire West Bank and the Gaza Strip, with East Jerusalem as its capital.The Saudi ambassador also confirmed that his country intends to open a consulate in East Jerusalem soon.",PHOTO,WORLD,"Saudi ambassador to Palestine Naif bin Bandar Al-Sudairi (Front) arrives at the Palestinian foreign ministry headquarters in the West Bank city of Ramallah, on Sept. 26, 2023.(Photo: Xinhua)",Author details not found,Author details not found,12,313,<FreqDist with 15 samples and 181 outcomes>
China releases a white paper on its proposals and actions on building a global community of shared future,GT staff reporters,2023-09-26," The Chinese government released a white paper on Tuesday to introduce the theoretical base, practice and development of a global community of shared future, as by presenting China's vision of the course of human development, it counters the hegemonic thinking of certain countries that seek supremacy. The white paper, titled ""A Global Community of Shared Future: China's Proposals and Actions,"" introduced the background for China to raise the concept of a global community of shared future as the world is undergoing changes on a scale unseen in a century with various problems posing unprecedented challenges for human society. The zero-sum game is doomed to fail, the white paper said. But certain countries still cling to this mindset, blindly pursuing absolute security and monopolistic advantages, which will do nothing for their development in the long run but create a major threat to the world. It is increasingly obvious that the obsession with superior strength, and the zero-sum mentality are in conflict with the needs of our times, the white paper said, pointing out that the new era calls for new ideas. To build a global community of shared future is to pursue openness, inclusiveness, mutual benefit, equity and justice, the white paper said. The goal is not to replace one system or civilization with another. Instead, it is about countries with different social systems, ideologies, histories, shared rights, and shared responsibilities in global affairs. The vision of a global community of shared future stands on the right side of history and on the side of human progress. It introduces a new approach for international relations, provides new ideas for global governance, opens up new prospects for international exchanges and draws a new blueprint for a better world, according to the white paper. Such important vision transcends outdated mindsets such as zero-sum game, power politics, and Cold War confrontations. It has become the overall goal of China's major-country diplomacy in the new era, and a great banner that leads the trend of the times and the direction of human progress. The concept of a global community of shared future has deep roots in China's profound cultural heritage and its unique experience of modernization. It carries forward the diplomatic traditions of China and draws on the outstanding achievements of all other civilizations, the white paper said. It also manifests China's time-honored historical traditions, distinct characteristics of the times, and a wealth of humanistic values.  The white paper also pointed out the direction and plan to build a global community of shared future including pressing ahead with a new type of economic globalization in which countries need to pursue a policy of openness and explicitly oppose protectionism, the erection of fences and barriers, unilateral sanctions, and maximum-pressure tactics, so as to connect economies and jointly build an open world economy. Some countries are seeking to decouple from China, enclosing themselves in ""small yards, high fences,"" which will ultimately only backfire, the white paper said. Also, some people overstate the need to ""reduce dependence"" and ""de-risk,"" which is essentially creating new risks. The direction and the plan also include following a peaceful development plan, fostering a new type of international relations, practicing true multilateralism and promoting the common values of humanity. Over the past decade, China has contributed its strength to building a global community of shared future with firm conviction and solid actions. For instance, by July 2023, more than three-quarters of countries in the world and over 30 international organizations had signed agreements on Belt and Road cooperation with China. The BRI originated in China but the opportunities and achievements it creates belong to the whole world. It's an initiative for economic cooperation, not for geopolitical or military alliances, and it's open and inclusive process that neither targets nor excludes any party, the white paper said. Among those BRI projects, for example, the China-Laos Railway began operation on December 3, 2021, with 167 tunnels and 301 bridges built in 11 years along its total length of 1,035 kilometers. The railway construction created more than 110,000 local jobs, and helped build about 2,000 kilometers of roads and canals for villages along the railway, benefiting local people. Besides the BRI, the Global Development Initiative, the Global Security Initiative and Global Civilization Initiative have evolved into a crucial cornerstone for building a global community of shared future, offering China's solutions to major challenges pertaining to peace and development for humanity. Facing constant flare-ups of hotspot issues, China has been committed to fulfilling its role as a responsible major country, pushing for the resolution of international and regional flashpoints, such as the Korean Peninsula, Palestine, the Iranian nuclear issue, Syria and Afghanistan, the white paper said. On the Ukraine issue, China has actively promoted talks for peace, put forth four points, four things that the international community should do together and three observations, and released China's position on the political settlement of the Ukraine crisis and has dispatched the special representative of the Chinese government on Eurasian affairs to engage in extensive interactions and exchanges with stakeholders on the political settlement of the Ukraine crisis. Also, through the mediation of China, Saudi Arabia and Iran achieve historic reconciliation earlier this year, setting a fine example for countries in the region to resolve disputes and differences and achieve good neighborly relations through dialogue and consultation, and catalyzing a wave of reconciliation in the Middle East. China has also proposed a range of regional and bilateral initiatives on building communities of shared future and working with stakeholders to build consensus and expand cooperation, there by playing a constructive role in promoting regional peace and development. It also boosts international cooperation in fields including fighting the COVID-19 pandemic, addressing disorder in cyberspace governance and dealing with the global climate challenge. Over the past decade, the vision of a global community of shared future has gained broader support. More countries and people have come to the understanding that this vision serves the common interests of humanity, represents popular calls for peace, justice and progress, and can create the greatest synergy among all nations for building a better world, the white paper said.",CHINA,POLITICS,Photo: Li Xuanmin/GT,Author details not found,Author details not found,33,1000,<FreqDist with 17 samples and 603 outcomes>

F-35: Closer Look at Colossally Costly Jet That Just Can’t Seem to Stay Airborne,Sputnik,2023-09-21,"A US Marine Corps F-35B went down over South Carolina on Sunday after its pilot ejected mid-flight for reasons unknown. Why do F-35s seem so crash-prone? What’s wrong with them? And what role does the waste and fraud in the US military-industrial complex play in creating such a Frankenstein’s monster of an aircraft? Sputnik explores.Debris from the F-35B that went missing over South Carolina on September 17 was found in Williamsburg County, South Carolina, about two hours northeast of Joint Base Charleston on Monday following more than a day of frantic searching by the military. An as yet unspecified “mishap” was blamed for the accident. The pilot escaped unscathed.“The mishap is currently under investigation, and we are unable to provide additional details to preserve the integrity of the investigative process,” the Marine Corps said in a statement Monday. The Marines ordered a two-day global pause in all aerial operations, with the errant F-35B becoming the third major aviation-related accident suffered by the military branch in less than two months.Air units will be discussing “fundamentals of safe flight operations, ground safety, maintenance and flight procedures, and maintaining combat readiness,” the Marine Corps said.How Many F-35s Have Been Lost?Since it started being introduced into service with the Marines (2015), the US Air Force (2016), and the US Navy (2019) and began to be exported to foreign clients (starting with Israel in 2018), the F-35 has gained an unenviable reputation of being a costly, buggy, and crash-prone jet, with the F-35B that went down over South Carolina last week being at least the 11th Lightning II lost since 2018.On September 28, 2018, a US Marine Corps F-35B crashed during a flight near Marine Corps Air Station Beaufort in South Carolina, with a faulty fuel tube blamed for the incident. The pilot emerged unscathed.On April 9, 2019, a Japanese Self- Defense Force F-35A went down off Honshu, Japan. The pilot was killed after losing his bearings and suffering “special disorientation” mid-flight over the ocean.On May 19, 2020, a US Air Force F-35A from the 58th Fighter Squadron crashed while performing a landing at Eglin Air Force Base in western Florida. Pilot error (trying to land at excessive speed) and a mechanical defect related to a flight control glitch that left the plane’s tail unresponsive were blamed. The pilot survived.On September 29, 2020, a US Marine Corps F-35B was lost over Imperial County, California after colliding with a KC-130 tanker during midflight refueling. The tanker crew managed to bring their aircraft down for a hard landing. The F-35 pilot ejected successfully.On November 17, 2021, a British Royal Air Force F-35B plunged into the Mediterranean Sea after its pilot ejected during routine operations. That crash was ultimately blamed on a protective cover getting wedged into the plane’s engine intake.On January 4, 2022, a South Korean Air Force F-35A suffering from issues with its onboard avionics carried out an emergency belly landing. Investigators blamed a bird striking the warplane’s landing gear mid-flight. The pilot emerged unharmed.On January 24, 2022, a US Navy F-35C plunged into the South China Sea after making a hard landing on the USS Carl Vinson super carrier. The pilot and six sailors on the deck of the aircraft carrier were injured. A Navy investigation attributed the incident to pilot error.On October 19, 2022, another F-35, this one from the US Air Force, crashed at Hill Air Force Base in Utah during a training mission. The pilot ejected safely. It was later determined that turbulent air somehow confused the jet’s onboard avionics to the point where the aircraft became uncontrollable.On December 1, 2022, a Marine Corps F-35B collapsed on a military base in Japan after suffering a landing gear failure during training. No one was injured.Finally, on December 15, 2022, a US Navy F-35B crashed while attempting to perform a vertical landing at Naval Air Station Joint Reserve Base Fort Worth in Texas during testing of the jet’s systems. A “harmonic resonance” issue related to the jet’s Pratt & Whitney F135 engine was blamed, with the Pentagon halting further F-35 deliveries by Lockheed until an investigation was concluded.What’s Wrong With the F-35?Nearly 17 years after the F-35’s first flight, and eight years after its adoption into service, the F-35 continues to maintain a troublingly long list of technical bugs affecting both hardware and software. The aircraft, which has an astronomical total estimated purchase and sustainment price tag of over $1.7 trillion, and a per-plane cost of $70-$90 million, has faced years of harsh criticism from US officials, including former President Donald Trump at one point, who said the jet’s costs had spiraled “out of control.”At its heart, the F-35 is the product of an idea that metastasized in the Pentagon after the end of the Cold War, envisioning an all-in-one fighter platform which could be used by every branch of the military, equipped with vertical take-off and landing capability, and carry out a broad array of missions using a variety of onboard weapons. The do-it-all jet was supposed to replace nearly all of America’s fourth-gen fighter, strike, and ground attack aircraft, including the F-16 Falcon, the F/A-18 Hornet and Super Hornet, the AV-8B Harrier II, and others.The jet features just a single onboard engine – the aforementioned Pratt & Whitney F135, with engine-related troubles not only regularly referred to by watchdogs as a “leading driver” of the F-35’s problems remaining “mission capable,” but also making its operation over enemy territory or over the sea risky, since if something goes wrong, the plane doesn’t have a backup engine to limp home with.Throughout its production cycle, the F-35 Lightning II has suffered a dizzying and seemingly endless list of technical problems, from neck-snapping ejection seats to problems, ironically, while operating in stormy weather.In its 2023 report, the congressional Government Accountability Office revealed that the F-35 program “continues to experience schedule delays, cost growth, and late deliveries,” with procurement costs jumping by $13.4 billion since 2019, and modernization behind schedule and over budget.“As of January 2023, of the 821 open deficiencies, the program office characterized five of these as category 1 [i.e. critical issues which could jeopardize flight safety and security], and 816 as category 2, [i.e. those which could impede or constrain mission success].”In all, between December 2006 and 2023, the GAO has reported a whopping 277 category 1 and 2,467 category 2 deficiencies with the aircraft, among them serious issues like cabin over-pressurization, problems with the jets’ night vision systems, software bugs, radar issues, corrosion, ejection seats which could snap pilots’ necks, etc.Is a Culture of Largess to Blame?Sunday’s accident in South Carolina is the latest piece of F-35-related bad news for Lockheed Martin. In June, it was reported that the Pentagon had halted the delivery of any additional upgraded F-35s until major issues related to new Technology Refresh 3 (TR-3) hardware and weapons-related software were resolved. DoD F-35 program director Mike Schmidt told Congress in March that the risk assessment related to the TR-3 hardware upgrade wouldn’t be finished until April 2024.Despite the delays and array of technical problems, the weapons giant has continued to rack up generous contracts related to F-35 procurement and production. For example, in July, the US Navy ordered a $490 million package of equipment from Lockheed “to procure various material mod kits, special test/tooling equipment, as well as…product engineering” for already delivered, but defective planes. In August, Lockheed received another $606 million “fixed-price incentive (firm-target) undefinitized” contract “for long lead time materials, parts, components, and efforts to support of maintaining on-time production and delivery of 173 Lot 19 F-35 Joint Strike Fighter aircraft for Foreign Military Sales (FMS) customers and non-US Department of Defense (DOD) participants.”The terms of the contracts seem to be the culprit behind the F-35’s soaring costs (and Lockheed’s soaring profits, despite delivery of defective products), with so-called “cost-plus” and “undefinitized” contracts effectively making any overruns the buyer’s problem – i.e. that of US taxpayers, and of citizens of any country unfortunate enough to pen contracts for the planes from Lockheed.What About America’s Competitors?The worst part about the F-35’s troublesome history seems to be that the F-35 has already become ""obsolete"" in the sense that many of the US and NATO’s competitors have obtained the ability to defeat them, with Russia and China gaining capabilities to track and target the jets going back to the mid-to-late 2010s. In April, Iran announced that its engineers had created advanced radar technologies to not only detect F-35s, but identify the radar signature of individual F-35 planes, enabling the Islamic Republic to plan defensive operations accordingly.",WORLD,AMERICAS,Picture description not found,Author details not found,Author details not found,60,1305,<FreqDist with 18 samples and 775 outcomes>
Toxic explosion in Nebraska shows US unable to take issues affecting public security seriously: experts,Xu Yelu,2023-09-15,"Barely two months after an explosion in Louisiana, a train carrying toxic perchloric acid has exploded in a Nebraska rail yard on Thursday, prompting evacuation orders to be issued, as huge plumes are seen engulfing the city. Experts said the incident shows the US has been unable to take seriously and overcome major issues affecting public safety and the environment and ecology in the country.The incident happened on Union Pacific Railroad tracks in the city of North Platte. North Platte Volunteer Fire Department announced that they would order those living in the area to evacuate due to the toxic smoke from the railroad, according to media reports.In a post on social media platforms, it said that ""Emergency evacuation for the area between splinter and front North of railroad track due fire at the railroad involving heavy toxic smoke.""In a statement to DailyMail.com, Union Pacific Railroad said that an explosion occurred inside a container which resulted in several railcars catching fire. The railcar did not derail, the company said, and had been in the yard for several hours.Union Pacific said that one of the containers contained a hazardous chemical called perchloric acid, according to Daily Mail.Perchloric is a hazardous material used in food, drugs and biocidal products, as well as explosives, according to the report.Two months ago, a fire at a Louisiana chemical plant triggered explosions that shook homes several miles away and sent flames and smoke billowing into the air in mid-July, prompting emergency officials to urge a few hundred nearby residents to shelter indoors for several hours and to turn off their air conditioners, the Associated Press reported.Antiquated infrastructure and the outdated transportation were one factor. Another was a flawed system of governance in the US transport industry, experts noted. There is no doubt that the US has serious loopholes in the transportation management of hazardous substances, and the relevant error correction mechanism is in fact not effective, which means that this kind of thing will occur in the future, Li Haidong, a professor at the China Foreign Affairs University, told the Global Times on Friday.This shows that the US has been unable to take seriously and overcome serious and major issues affecting public safety and the environment and ecology in the country, Li said. ""It must be said that this is a great irony to the self-proclaimed internal governance of the most advanced country in the world.""Analysts said that the frequent occurrence of similar incidents shows that the error correction mechanism in the US has failed. Apart from this, racism and the proliferation of guns are also clear examples of the failure of error correction mechanisms, experts noted.",WORLD,AMERICAS,"A resident of East Palestine in the state of Ohio, US, angrily points during a town hall meeting held by the US

Greek scholar believes in ‘endless possibilities and vast land’ between China-Greece exchanges,Xu Liuliu,2023-09-14,"Chongqing, Sichuan, Shandong… Stelios Virvidakis expectantly plans his next China tour before a visit by the Global Times at his office in Athens, Greece. The University of Athens professor has grown far busier recently since he and four other Greek scholars launched the Center of Chinese and Greek Ancient Civilizations in February. Over the summer, the center has received two scholars from China who have given lectures on the history of China, and other visiting guests from places like Israel, who offered their views on Chinese medicine and its history, and a lecturer from France with insights in Chinese mathematics and how scholars in ancient China studied the living science.""Students found them to be very interesting and greatly appreciated the lectures,"" Virvidakis told the Global Times. ""Greece and China share so many similarities. So in my opinion, the horizon for our cooperation and exchanges is vast. There are endless possibilities which have not been explored.""Mutual learning Chinese President Xi Jinping replied to a letter from Virvidakis and four other Greek scholars earlier in 2023, extending congratulations over the founding of the Center of Chinese and Greek Ancient Civilizations.Hailing the long history of the Chinese civilization and profound influence of the ancient Greek civilization, Xi said in the letter that more than 2,000 years ago, the two civilizations shone brightly on the two ends of the Eurasian continent, jointly making a fundamental contribution to the evolution of human civilization.Greece's golden era produced many of its great philosophers and literary giants. The era coincided with a period in China in which ""a hundred schools of thought contended with each other"" and flourished together.As early as the 4th century BC, China was known to the Greeks by a beautiful name: Sērikḗ. In the 16th century, Euclid's Elements was introduced into China, paving the way for scientific exchanges between China and the West. The story of Prometheus narrated by Aeschylus was an inspiration to many Chinese revolutionaries. The Republic by Plato and Politics by Aristotle are also among the Greek classics known to have long made a name for themselves in China.In the eyes of Virvidakis, Chinese civilization has always been a culture that attracts people though the language is difficult. However, Chinese art, Chinese painting, Chinese poetry, especially love poems, even detective stories about China, are incredibly fascinating. Chinese director Zhang Yimou, and movies like Farewell My Concubine and Raise the Red Lantern starring Gong Li, are also very popular. Greek archaeologists who are interested in Chinese archeology want to know how China explores the past.In other art forms, the mythology and theater, ""we have tragedy, which is our own tradition. You have Chinese opera with music."" Actors and artists always want to study similarities and look at the differences, which is also the commitment of the center to promoting exchanges and mutual learning between the two civilizations and promoting the development of civilizations in various countries. China also has this appeal because people in the West think ""it's very different, it's exotic, something strange, but then they realize that it's beautiful for them."" So ""they find a lot of aspects that they have not thought about before in order to understand.""

Tiantan, a UNESCO World Heritage Site built in 1420, in Beijing Photo: VCGPhilosophy, a way of life There is a feeling among some people in the West that the Chinese system is different in some ways, said the professor. For instance,the European and American systems place great emphasis on individual rights, but China takes a more holistic approach in which ""harmony, social harmony is more important in sovereign.""""We are not exactly the same and there are also differences. But I don't believe in the so-called clash of civilizations theory that the clash is very deep and we can't live together with our differences,"" he told the Global Times. ""In fact we can live together and have peaceful exchanges. As I said, I don't think there is any danger of Greece threatening China or China occupying Greece.""In February, Virvidakis held a lecture at the center's launching ceremony, titled Philosophy is a Way of Life. Philosophy is not just theory, he said, noting that in ancient Greece and China it didn't mean just making theories about the universe, nature, god, or much of the unknown world. ""It told you how to 'organize' your life to feel happy and achieve harmony with others."" Western philosophy cannot be understood just by itself as there are also Chinese and Indian schools of philosophy among others. ""It is easier to see some similarities in ideas between Confucius and Socrates or Confucius and Aristotle,"" said Virvidakis, explaining why he is so fond of Chinese philosophy, especially Confucius thought. A simple question about what is a good life has a variety of answers in different philosophical theories.  But studying philosophy is practical and a way of life. Modern people don't just derive happiness from materialism. They need art and other emotionally stirring elements in life. In different parts and different cultures of the world,people can share similarities in emotion and sentiment.Virvidakis said that one of the most important reasons for his involving in such studies and exchanges was because ""I'm interested and I want to learn more. I'm a student too. When you are a teacher in your whole life, you're going to be a student.""",ARTS,CULTURE & LEISURE,The University of Athens Photo: VCG,"Reporter, Beijing","Global Times senior reporter, mainly covers the reporting of movies, TV, music and culture news.",43,880,<FreqDist with 16 samples and 473 outcomes>

 The first Saudi ambassador to Palestine Naif bin Bandar Al-Sudairi arrived in the West Bank on Tuesday, the official Palestinian news agency WAFA reported.Leading an official delegation, Al-Sudairi, the non-resident ambassador to Palestine and non-resident consul general in Jerusalem, presented his credentials to Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas at the presidency headquarters in Ramallah, it said.Al-Sudairi's arrival comes amid Israel's efforts to normalize relations with Saudi Arabia.During their meeting, Abbas welcomed Al-Sudairi and said his visit to Palestine and his appointment as Saudi ambassador to the State of Palestine would contribute to ""strengthening the strong fraternal relations that bind the two countries and the two brotherly peoples.""The Saudi ambassador said he hoped that his visit would be ""a successful beginning for strengthening relations in all fields,"" stressing his country's firm and supportive positions for the Palestinian people and their just cause.Earlier in the day, Al-Sudairi told reporters in a statement that ""the Arab Peace Initiative is the basic point in any upcoming agreement,"" after being asked about the fate of the initiative in the event of reaching a normalization deal between Saudi Arabia and Israel.The Arab Peace Initiative was launched in 2002 after it was drafted by Saudi Arabia and adopted by the Arab League.The initiative calls for an end to the conflict between Israel and Palestine and the normalization of relations between Israel and Arab states, in exchange for an Israeli withdrawal from the areas it gained since 1967 and proper settlement to the issue of Palestinian refugees.The Palestinians demanded the establishment of an independent state alongside Israel in all of the Palestinian territories occupied by Israel in 1967, including the entire West Bank and the Gaza Strip, with East Jerusalem as its capital.The Saudi ambassador also confirmed that his country intends to open a consulate in East Jerusalem soon.",PHOTO,WORLD,"Saudi ambassador to Palestine Naif bin Bandar Al-Sudairi (Front) arrives at the Palestinian foreign ministry headquarters in the West Bank city of Ramallah, on Sept. 26, 2023.(Photo: Xinhua)",Author details not found,Author details not found,12,313,<FreqDist with 15 samples and 181 outcomes>
China releases a white paper on its proposals and actions on building a global community of shared future,GT staff reporters,2023-09-26," The Chinese government released a white paper on Tuesday to introduce the theoretical base, practice and development of a global community of shared future, as by presenting China's vision of the course of human development, it counters the hegemonic thinking of certain countries that seek supremacy. The white paper, titled ""A Global Community of Shared Future: China's Proposals and Actions,"" introduced the background for China to raise the concept of a global community of shared future as the world is undergoing changes on a scale unseen in a century with various problems posing unprecedented challenges for human society. The zero-sum game is doomed to fail, the white paper said. But certain countries still cling to this mindset, blindly pursuing absolute security and monopolistic advantages, which will do nothing for their development in the long run but create a major threat to the world. It is increasingly obvious that the obsession with superior strength, and the zero-sum mentality are in conflict with the needs of our times, the white paper said, pointing out that the new era calls for new ideas. To build a global community of shared future is to pursue openness, inclusiveness, mutual benefit, equity and justice, the white paper said. The goal is not to replace one system or civilization with another. Instead, it is about countries with different social systems, ideologies, histories, shared rights, and shared responsibilities in global affairs. The vision of a global community of shared future stands on the right side of history and on the side of human progress. It introduces a new approach for international relations, provides new ideas for global governance, opens up new prospects for international exchanges and draws a new blueprint for a better world, according to the white paper. Such important vision transcends outdated mindsets such as zero-sum game, power politics, and Cold War confrontations. It has become the overall goal of China's major-country diplomacy in the new era, and a great banner that leads the trend of the times and the direction of human progress. The concept of a global community of shared future has deep roots in China's profound cultural heritage and its unique experience of modernization. It carries forward the diplomatic traditions of China and draws on the outstanding achievements of all other civilizations, the white paper said. It also manifests China's time-honored historical traditions, distinct characteristics of the times, and a wealth of humanistic values.  The white paper also pointed out the direction and plan to build a global community of shared future including pressing ahead with a new type of economic globalization in which countries need to pursue a policy of openness and explicitly oppose protectionism, the erection of fences and barriers, unilateral sanctions, and maximum-pressure tactics, so as to connect economies and jointly build an open world economy. Some countries are seeking to decouple from China, enclosing themselves in ""small yards, high fences,"" which will ultimately only backfire, the white paper said. Also, some people overstate the need to ""reduce dependence"" and ""de-risk,"" which is essentially creating new risks. The direction and the plan also include following a peaceful development plan, fostering a new type of international relations, practicing true multilateralism and promoting the common values of humanity. Over the past decade, China has contributed its strength to building a global community of shared future with firm conviction and solid actions. For instance, by July 2023, more than three-quarters of countries in the world and over 30 international organizations had signed agreements on Belt and Road cooperation with China. The BRI originated in China but the opportunities and achievements it creates belong to the whole world. It's an initiative for economic cooperation, not for geopolitical or military alliances, and it's open and inclusive process that neither targets nor excludes any party, the white paper said. Among those BRI projects, for example, the China-Laos Railway began operation on December 3, 2021, with 167 tunnels and 301 bridges built in 11 years along its total length of 1,035 kilometers. The railway construction created more than 110,000 local jobs, and helped build about 2,000 kilometers of roads and canals for villages along the railway, benefiting local people. Besides the BRI, the Global Development Initiative, the Global Security Initiative and Global Civilization Initiative have evolved into a crucial cornerstone for building a global community of shared future, offering China's solutions to major challenges pertaining to peace and development for humanity. Facing constant flare-ups of hotspot issues, China has been committed to fulfilling its role as a responsible major country, pushing for the resolution of international and regional flashpoints, such as the Korean Peninsula, Palestine, the Iranian nuclear issue, Syria and Afghanistan, the white paper said. On the Ukraine issue, China has actively promoted talks for peace, put forth four points, four things that the international community should do together and three observations, and released China's position on the political settlement of the Ukraine crisis and has dispatched the special representative of the Chinese government on Eurasian affairs to engage in extensive interactions and exchanges with stakeholders on the political settlement of the Ukraine crisis. Also, through the mediation of China, Saudi Arabia and Iran achieve historic reconciliation earlier this year, setting a fine example for countries in the region to resolve disputes and differences and achieve good neighborly relations through dialogue and consultation, and catalyzing a wave of reconciliation in the Middle East. China has also proposed a range of regional and bilateral initiatives on building communities of shared future and working with stakeholders to build consensus and expand cooperation, there by playing a constructive role in promoting regional peace and development. It also boosts international cooperation in fields including fighting the COVID-19 pandemic, addressing disorder in cyberspace governance and dealing with the global climate challenge. Over the past decade, the vision of a global community of shared future has gained broader support. More countries and people have come to the understanding that this vision serves the common interests of humanity, represents popular calls for peace, justice and progress, and can create the greatest synergy among all nations for building a better world, the white paper said.",CHINA,POLITICS,Photo: Li Xuanmin/GT,Author details not found,Author details not found,33,1000,<FreqDist with 17 samples and 603 outcomes>

F-35: Closer Look at Colossally Costly Jet That Just Can’t Seem to Stay Airborne,Sputnik,2023-09-21,"A US Marine Corps F-35B went down over South Carolina on Sunday after its pilot ejected mid-flight for reasons unknown. Why do F-35s seem so crash-prone? What’s wrong with them? And what role does the waste and fraud in the US military-industrial complex play in creating such a Frankenstein’s monster of an aircraft? Sputnik explores.Debris from the F-35B that went missing over South Carolina on September 17 was found in Williamsburg County, South Carolina, about two hours northeast of Joint Base Charleston on Monday following more than a day of frantic searching by the military. An as yet unspecified “mishap” was blamed for the accident. The pilot escaped unscathed.“The mishap is currently under investigation, and we are unable to provide additional details to preserve the integrity of the investigative process,” the Marine Corps said in a statement Monday. The Marines ordered a two-day global pause in all aerial operations, with the errant F-35B becoming the third major aviation-related accident suffered by the military branch in less than two months.Air units will be discussing “fundamentals of safe flight operations, ground safety, maintenance and flight procedures, and maintaining combat readiness,” the Marine Corps said.How Many F-35s Have Been Lost?Since it started being introduced into service with the Marines (2015), the US Air Force (2016), and the US Navy (2019) and began to be exported to foreign clients (starting with Israel in 2018), the F-35 has gained an unenviable reputation of being a costly, buggy, and crash-prone jet, with the F-35B that went down over South Carolina last week being at least the 11th Lightning II lost since 2018.On September 28, 2018, a US Marine Corps F-35B crashed during a flight near Marine Corps Air Station Beaufort in South Carolina, with a faulty fuel tube blamed for the incident. The pilot emerged unscathed.On April 9, 2019, a Japanese Self- Defense Force F-35A went down off Honshu, Japan. The pilot was killed after losing his bearings and suffering “special disorientation” mid-flight over the ocean.On May 19, 2020, a US Air Force F-35A from the 58th Fighter Squadron crashed while performing a landing at Eglin Air Force Base in western Florida. Pilot error (trying to land at excessive speed) and a mechanical defect related to a flight control glitch that left the plane’s tail unresponsive were blamed. The pilot survived.On September 29, 2020, a US Marine Corps F-35B was lost over Imperial County, California after colliding with a KC-130 tanker during midflight refueling. The tanker crew managed to bring their aircraft down for a hard landing. The F-35 pilot ejected successfully.On November 17, 2021, a British Royal Air Force F-35B plunged into the Mediterranean Sea after its pilot ejected during routine operations. That crash was ultimately blamed on a protective cover getting wedged into the plane’s engine intake.On January 4, 2022, a South Korean Air Force F-35A suffering from issues with its onboard avionics carried out an emergency belly landing. Investigators blamed a bird striking the warplane’s landing gear mid-flight. The pilot emerged unharmed.On January 24, 2022, a US Navy F-35C plunged into the South China Sea after making a hard landing on the USS Carl Vinson super carrier. The pilot and six sailors on the deck of the aircraft carrier were injured. A Navy investigation attributed the incident to pilot error.On October 19, 2022, another F-35, this one from the US Air Force, crashed at Hill Air Force Base in Utah during a training mission. The pilot ejected safely. It was later determined that turbulent air somehow confused the jet’s onboard avionics to the point where the aircraft became uncontrollable.On December 1, 2022, a Marine Corps F-35B collapsed on a military base in Japan after suffering a landing gear failure during training. No one was injured.Finally, on December 15, 2022, a US Navy F-35B crashed while attempting to perform a vertical landing at Naval Air Station Joint Reserve Base Fort Worth in Texas during testing of the jet’s systems. A “harmonic resonance” issue related to the jet’s Pratt & Whitney F135 engine was blamed, with the Pentagon halting further F-35 deliveries by Lockheed until an investigation was concluded.What’s Wrong With the F-35?Nearly 17 years after the F-35’s first flight, and eight years after its adoption into service, the F-35 continues to maintain a troublingly long list of technical bugs affecting both hardware and software. The aircraft, which has an astronomical total estimated purchase and sustainment price tag of over $1.7 trillion, and a per-plane cost of $70-$90 million, has faced years of harsh criticism from US officials, including former President Donald Trump at one point, who said the jet’s costs had spiraled “out of control.”At its heart, the F-35 is the product of an idea that metastasized in the Pentagon after the end of the Cold War, envisioning an all-in-one fighter platform which could be used by every branch of the military, equipped with vertical take-off and landing capability, and carry out a broad array of missions using a variety of onboard weapons. The do-it-all jet was supposed to replace nearly all of America’s fourth-gen fighter, strike, and ground attack aircraft, including the F-16 Falcon, the F/A-18 Hornet and Super Hornet, the AV-8B Harrier II, and others.The jet features just a single onboard engine – the aforementioned Pratt & Whitney F135, with engine-related troubles not only regularly referred to by watchdogs as a “leading driver” of the F-35’s problems remaining “mission capable,” but also making its operation over enemy territory or over the sea risky, since if something goes wrong, the plane doesn’t have a backup engine to limp home with.Throughout its production cycle, the F-35 Lightning II has suffered a dizzying and seemingly endless list of technical problems, from neck-snapping ejection seats to problems, ironically, while operating in stormy weather.In its 2023 report, the congressional Government Accountability Office revealed that the F-35 program “continues to experience schedule delays, cost growth, and late deliveries,” with procurement costs jumping by $13.4 billion since 2019, and modernization behind schedule and over budget.“As of January 2023, of the 821 open deficiencies, the program office characterized five of these as category 1 [i.e. critical issues which could jeopardize flight safety and security], and 816 as category 2, [i.e. those which could impede or constrain mission success].”In all, between December 2006 and 2023, the GAO has reported a whopping 277 category 1 and 2,467 category 2 deficiencies with the aircraft, among them serious issues like cabin over-pressurization, problems with the jets’ night vision systems, software bugs, radar issues, corrosion, ejection seats which could snap pilots’ necks, etc.Is a Culture of Largess to Blame?Sunday’s accident in South Carolina is the latest piece of F-35-related bad news for Lockheed Martin. In June, it was reported that the Pentagon had halted the delivery of any additional upgraded F-35s until major issues related to new Technology Refresh 3 (TR-3) hardware and weapons-related software were resolved. DoD F-35 program director Mike Schmidt told Congress in March that the risk assessment related to the TR-3 hardware upgrade wouldn’t be finished until April 2024.Despite the delays and array of technical problems, the weapons giant has continued to rack up generous contracts related to F-35 procurement and production. For example, in July, the US Navy ordered a $490 million package of equipment from Lockheed “to procure various material mod kits, special test/tooling equipment, as well as…product engineering” for already delivered, but defective planes. In August, Lockheed received another $606 million “fixed-price incentive (firm-target) undefinitized” contract “for long lead time materials, parts, components, and efforts to support of maintaining on-time production and delivery of 173 Lot 19 F-35 Joint Strike Fighter aircraft for Foreign Military Sales (FMS) customers and non-US Department of Defense (DOD) participants.”The terms of the contracts seem to be the culprit behind the F-35’s soaring costs (and Lockheed’s soaring profits, despite delivery of defective products), with so-called “cost-plus” and “undefinitized” contracts effectively making any overruns the buyer’s problem – i.e. that of US taxpayers, and of citizens of any country unfortunate enough to pen contracts for the planes from Lockheed.What About America’s Competitors?The worst part about the F-35’s troublesome history seems to be that the F-35 has already become ""obsolete"" in the sense that many of the US and NATO’s competitors have obtained the ability to defeat them, with Russia and China gaining capabilities to track and target the jets going back to the mid-to-late 2010s. In April, Iran announced that its engineers had created advanced radar technologies to not only detect F-35s, but identify the radar signature of individual F-35 planes, enabling the Islamic Republic to plan defensive operations accordingly.",WORLD,AMERICAS,Picture description not found,Author details not found,Author details not found,60,1305,<FreqDist with 18 samples and 775 outcomes>
Toxic explosion in Nebraska shows US unable to take issues affecting public security seriously: experts,Xu Yelu,2023-09-15,"Barely two months after an explosion in Louisiana, a train carrying toxic perchloric acid has exploded in a Nebraska rail yard on Thursday, prompting evacuation orders to be issued, as huge plumes are seen engulfing the city. Experts said the incident shows the US has been unable to take seriously and overcome major issues affecting public safety and the environment and ecology in the country.The incident happened on Union Pacific Railroad tracks in the city of North Platte. North Platte Volunteer Fire Department announced that they would order those living in the area to evacuate due to the toxic smoke from the railroad, according to media reports.In a post on social media platforms, it said that ""Emergency evacuation for the area between splinter and front North of railroad track due fire at the railroad involving heavy toxic smoke.""In a statement to DailyMail.com, Union Pacific Railroad said that an explosion occurred inside a container which resulted in several railcars catching fire. The railcar did not derail, the company said, and had been in the yard for several hours.Union Pacific said that one of the containers contained a hazardous chemical called perchloric acid, according to Daily Mail.Perchloric is a hazardous material used in food, drugs and biocidal products, as well as explosives, according to the report.Two months ago, a fire at a Louisiana chemical plant triggered explosions that shook homes several miles away and sent flames and smoke billowing into the air in mid-July, prompting emergency officials to urge a few hundred nearby residents to shelter indoors for several hours and to turn off their air conditioners, the Associated Press reported.Antiquated infrastructure and the outdated transportation were one factor. Another was a flawed system of governance in the US transport industry, experts noted. There is no doubt that the US has serious loopholes in the transportation management of hazardous substances, and the relevant error correction mechanism is in fact not effective, which means that this kind of thing will occur in the future, Li Haidong, a professor at the China Foreign Affairs University, told the Global Times on Friday.This shows that the US has been unable to take seriously and overcome serious and major issues affecting public safety and the environment and ecology in the country, Li said. ""It must be said that this is a great irony to the self-proclaimed internal governance of the most advanced country in the world.""Analysts said that the frequent occurrence of similar incidents shows that the error correction mechanism in the US has failed. Apart from this, racism and the proliferation of guns are also clear examples of the failure of error correction mechanisms, experts noted.",WORLD,AMERICAS,"A resident of East Palestine in the state of Ohio, US, angrily points during a town hall meeting held by the US

Greek scholar believes in ‘endless possibilities and vast land’ between China-Greece exchanges,Xu Liuliu,2023-09-14,"Chongqing, Sichuan, Shandong… Stelios Virvidakis expectantly plans his next China tour before a visit by the Global Times at his office in Athens, Greece. The University of Athens professor has grown far busier recently since he and four other Greek scholars launched the Center of Chinese and Greek Ancient Civilizations in February. Over the summer, the center has received two scholars from China who have given lectures on the history of China, and other visiting guests from places like Israel, who offered their views on Chinese medicine and its history, and a lecturer from France with insights in Chinese mathematics and how scholars in ancient China studied the living science.""Students found them to be very interesting and greatly appreciated the lectures,"" Virvidakis told the Global Times. ""Greece and China share so many similarities. So in my opinion, the horizon for our cooperation and exchanges is vast. There are endless possibilities which have not been explored.""Mutual learning Chinese President Xi Jinping replied to a letter from Virvidakis and four other Greek scholars earlier in 2023, extending congratulations over the founding of the Center of Chinese and Greek Ancient Civilizations.Hailing the long history of the Chinese civilization and profound influence of the ancient Greek civilization, Xi said in the letter that more than 2,000 years ago, the two civilizations shone brightly on the two ends of the Eurasian continent, jointly making a fundamental contribution to the evolution of human civilization.Greece's golden era produced many of its great philosophers and literary giants. The era coincided with a period in China in which ""a hundred schools of thought contended with each other"" and flourished together.As early as the 4th century BC, China was known to the Greeks by a beautiful name: Sērikḗ. In the 16th century, Euclid's Elements was introduced into China, paving the way for scientific exchanges between China and the West. The story of Prometheus narrated by Aeschylus was an inspiration to many Chinese revolutionaries. The Republic by Plato and Politics by Aristotle are also among the Greek classics known to have long made a name for themselves in China.In the eyes of Virvidakis, Chinese civilization has always been a culture that attracts people though the language is difficult. However, Chinese art, Chinese painting, Chinese poetry, especially love poems, even detective stories about China, are incredibly fascinating. Chinese director Zhang Yimou, and movies like Farewell My Concubine and Raise the Red Lantern starring Gong Li, are also very popular. Greek archaeologists who are interested in Chinese archeology want to know how China explores the past.In other art forms, the mythology and theater, ""we have tragedy, which is our own tradition. You have Chinese opera with music."" Actors and artists always want to study similarities and look at the differences, which is also the commitment of the center to promoting exchanges and mutual learning between the two civilizations and promoting the development of civilizations in various countries. China also has this appeal because people in the West think ""it's very different, it's exotic, something strange, but then they realize that it's beautiful for them."" So ""they find a lot of aspects that they have not thought about before in order to understand.""

Tiantan, a UNESCO World Heritage Site built in 1420, in Beijing Photo: VCGPhilosophy, a way of life There is a feeling among some people in the West that the Chinese system is different in some ways, said the professor. For instance,the European and American systems place great emphasis on individual rights, but China takes a more holistic approach in which ""harmony, social harmony is more important in sovereign.""""We are not exactly the same and there are also differences. But I don't believe in the so-called clash of civilizations theory that the clash is very deep and we can't live together with our differences,"" he told the Global Times. ""In fact we can live together and have peaceful exchanges. As I said, I don't think there is any danger of Greece threatening China or China occupying Greece.""In February, Virvidakis held a lecture at the center's launching ceremony, titled Philosophy is a Way of Life. Philosophy is not just theory, he said, noting that in ancient Greece and China it didn't mean just making theories about the universe, nature, god, or much of the unknown world. ""It told you how to 'organize' your life to feel happy and achieve harmony with others."" Western philosophy cannot be understood just by itself as there are also Chinese and Indian schools of philosophy among others. ""It is easier to see some similarities in ideas between Confucius and Socrates or Confucius and Aristotle,"" said Virvidakis, explaining why he is so fond of Chinese philosophy, especially Confucius thought. A simple question about what is a good life has a variety of answers in different philosophical theories.  But studying philosophy is practical and a way of life. Modern people don't just derive happiness from materialism. They need art and other emotionally stirring elements in life. In different parts and different cultures of the world,people can share similarities in emotion and sentiment.Virvidakis said that one of the most important reasons for his involving in such studies and exchanges was because ""I'm interested and I want to learn more. I'm a student too. When you are a teacher in your whole life, you're going to be a student.""",ARTS,CULTURE & LEISURE,The University of Athens Photo: VCG,"Reporter, Beijing","Global Times senior reporter, mainly covers the reporting of movies, TV, music and culture news.",43,880,<FreqDist with 16 samples and 473 outcomes>

 The first Saudi ambassador to Palestine Naif bin Bandar Al-Sudairi arrived in the West Bank on Tuesday, the official Palestinian news agency WAFA reported.Leading an official delegation, Al-Sudairi, the non-resident ambassador to Palestine and non-resident consul general in Jerusalem, presented his credentials to Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas at the presidency headquarters in Ramallah, it said.Al-Sudairi's arrival comes amid Israel's efforts to normalize relations with Saudi Arabia.During their meeting, Abbas welcomed Al-Sudairi and said his visit to Palestine and his appointment as Saudi ambassador to the State of Palestine would contribute to ""strengthening the strong fraternal relations that bind the two countries and the two brotherly peoples.""The Saudi ambassador said he hoped that his visit would be ""a successful beginning for strengthening relations in all fields,"" stressing his country's firm and supportive positions for the Palestinian people and their just cause.Earlier in the day, Al-Sudairi told reporters in a statement that ""the Arab Peace Initiative is the basic point in any upcoming agreement,"" after being asked about the fate of the initiative in the event of reaching a normalization deal between Saudi Arabia and Israel.The Arab Peace Initiative was launched in 2002 after it was drafted by Saudi Arabia and adopted by the Arab League.The initiative calls for an end to the conflict between Israel and Palestine and the normalization of relations between Israel and Arab states, in exchange for an Israeli withdrawal from the areas it gained since 1967 and proper settlement to the issue of Palestinian refugees.The Palestinians demanded the establishment of an independent state alongside Israel in all of the Palestinian territories occupied by Israel in 1967, including the entire West Bank and the Gaza Strip, with East Jerusalem as its capital.The Saudi ambassador also confirmed that his country intends to open a consulate in East Jerusalem soon.",PHOTO,WORLD,"Saudi ambassador to Palestine Naif bin Bandar Al-Sudairi (Front) arrives at the Palestinian foreign ministry headquarters in the West Bank city of Ramallah, on Sept. 26, 2023.(Photo: Xinhua)",Author details not found,Author details not found,12,313,<FreqDist with 15 samples and 181 outcomes>
China releases a white paper on its proposals and actions on building a global community of shared future,GT staff reporters,2023-09-26," The Chinese government released a white paper on Tuesday to introduce the theoretical base, practice and development of a global community of shared future, as by presenting China's vision of the course of human development, it counters the hegemonic thinking of certain countries that seek supremacy. The white paper, titled ""A Global Community of Shared Future: China's Proposals and Actions,"" introduced the background for China to raise the concept of a global community of shared future as the world is undergoing changes on a scale unseen in a century with various problems posing unprecedented challenges for human society. The zero-sum game is doomed to fail, the white paper said. But certain countries still cling to this mindset, blindly pursuing absolute security and monopolistic advantages, which will do nothing for their development in the long run but create a major threat to the world. It is increasingly obvious that the obsession with superior strength, and the zero-sum mentality are in conflict with the needs of our times, the white paper said, pointing out that the new era calls for new ideas. To build a global community of shared future is to pursue openness, inclusiveness, mutual benefit, equity and justice, the white paper said. The goal is not to replace one system or civilization with another. Instead, it is about countries with different social systems, ideologies, histories, shared rights, and shared responsibilities in global affairs. The vision of a global community of shared future stands on the right side of history and on the side of human progress. It introduces a new approach for international relations, provides new ideas for global governance, opens up new prospects for international exchanges and draws a new blueprint for a better world, according to the white paper. Such important vision transcends outdated mindsets such as zero-sum game, power politics, and Cold War confrontations. It has become the overall goal of China's major-country diplomacy in the new era, and a great banner that leads the trend of the times and the direction of human progress. The concept of a global community of shared future has deep roots in China's profound cultural heritage and its unique experience of modernization. It carries forward the diplomatic traditions of China and draws on the outstanding achievements of all other civilizations, the white paper said. It also manifests China's time-honored historical traditions, distinct characteristics of the times, and a wealth of humanistic values.  The white paper also pointed out the direction and plan to build a global community of shared future including pressing ahead with a new type of economic globalization in which countries need to pursue a policy of openness and explicitly oppose protectionism, the erection of fences and barriers, unilateral sanctions, and maximum-pressure tactics, so as to connect economies and jointly build an open world economy. Some countries are seeking to decouple from China, enclosing themselves in ""small yards, high fences,"" which will ultimately only backfire, the white paper said. Also, some people overstate the need to ""reduce dependence"" and ""de-risk,"" which is essentially creating new risks. The direction and the plan also include following a peaceful development plan, fostering a new type of international relations, practicing true multilateralism and promoting the common values of humanity. Over the past decade, China has contributed its strength to building a global community of shared future with firm conviction and solid actions. For instance, by July 2023, more than three-quarters of countries in the world and over 30 international organizations had signed agreements on Belt and Road cooperation with China. The BRI originated in China but the opportunities and achievements it creates belong to the whole world. It's an initiative for economic cooperation, not for geopolitical or military alliances, and it's open and inclusive process that neither targets nor excludes any party, the white paper said. Among those BRI projects, for example, the China-Laos Railway began operation on December 3, 2021, with 167 tunnels and 301 bridges built in 11 years along its total length of 1,035 kilometers. The railway construction created more than 110,000 local jobs, and helped build about 2,000 kilometers of roads and canals for villages along the railway, benefiting local people. Besides the BRI, the Global Development Initiative, the Global Security Initiative and Global Civilization Initiative have evolved into a crucial cornerstone for building a global community of shared future, offering China's solutions to major challenges pertaining to peace and development for humanity. Facing constant flare-ups of hotspot issues, China has been committed to fulfilling its role as a responsible major country, pushing for the resolution of international and regional flashpoints, such as the Korean Peninsula, Palestine, the Iranian nuclear issue, Syria and Afghanistan, the white paper said. On the Ukraine issue, China has actively promoted talks for peace, put forth four points, four things that the international community should do together and three observations, and released China's position on the political settlement of the Ukraine crisis and has dispatched the special representative of the Chinese government on Eurasian affairs to engage in extensive interactions and exchanges with stakeholders on the political settlement of the Ukraine crisis. Also, through the mediation of China, Saudi Arabia and Iran achieve historic reconciliation earlier this year, setting a fine example for countries in the region to resolve disputes and differences and achieve good neighborly relations through dialogue and consultation, and catalyzing a wave of reconciliation in the Middle East. China has also proposed a range of regional and bilateral initiatives on building communities of shared future and working with stakeholders to build consensus and expand cooperation, there by playing a constructive role in promoting regional peace and development. It also boosts international cooperation in fields including fighting the COVID-19 pandemic, addressing disorder in cyberspace governance and dealing with the global climate challenge. Over the past decade, the vision of a global community of shared future has gained broader support. More countries and people have come to the understanding that this vision serves the common interests of humanity, represents popular calls for peace, justice and progress, and can create the greatest synergy among all nations for building a better world, the white paper said.",CHINA,POLITICS,Photo: Li Xuanmin/GT,Author details not found,Author details not found,33,1000,<FreqDist with 17 samples and 603 outcomes>

F-35: Closer Look at Colossally Costly Jet That Just Can’t Seem to Stay Airborne,Sputnik,2023-09-21,"A US Marine Corps F-35B went down over South Carolina on Sunday after its pilot ejected mid-flight for reasons unknown. Why do F-35s seem so crash-prone? What’s wrong with them? And what role does the waste and fraud in the US military-industrial complex play in creating such a Frankenstein’s monster of an aircraft? Sputnik explores.Debris from the F-35B that went missing over South Carolina on September 17 was found in Williamsburg County, South Carolina, about two hours northeast of Joint Base Charleston on Monday following more than a day of frantic searching by the military. An as yet unspecified “mishap” was blamed for the accident. The pilot escaped unscathed.“The mishap is currently under investigation, and we are unable to provide additional details to preserve the integrity of the investigative process,” the Marine Corps said in a statement Monday. The Marines ordered a two-day global pause in all aerial operations, with the errant F-35B becoming the third major aviation-related accident suffered by the military branch in less than two months.Air units will be discussing “fundamentals of safe flight operations, ground safety, maintenance and flight procedures, and maintaining combat readiness,” the Marine Corps said.How Many F-35s Have Been Lost?Since it started being introduced into service with the Marines (2015), the US Air Force (2016), and the US Navy (2019) and began to be exported to foreign clients (starting with Israel in 2018), the F-35 has gained an unenviable reputation of being a costly, buggy, and crash-prone jet, with the F-35B that went down over South Carolina last week being at least the 11th Lightning II lost since 2018.On September 28, 2018, a US Marine Corps F-35B crashed during a flight near Marine Corps Air Station Beaufort in South Carolina, with a faulty fuel tube blamed for the incident. The pilot emerged unscathed.On April 9, 2019, a Japanese Self- Defense Force F-35A went down off Honshu, Japan. The pilot was killed after losing his bearings and suffering “special disorientation” mid-flight over the ocean.On May 19, 2020, a US Air Force F-35A from the 58th Fighter Squadron crashed while performing a landing at Eglin Air Force Base in western Florida. Pilot error (trying to land at excessive speed) and a mechanical defect related to a flight control glitch that left the plane’s tail unresponsive were blamed. The pilot survived.On September 29, 2020, a US Marine Corps F-35B was lost over Imperial County, California after colliding with a KC-130 tanker during midflight refueling. The tanker crew managed to bring their aircraft down for a hard landing. The F-35 pilot ejected successfully.On November 17, 2021, a British Royal Air Force F-35B plunged into the Mediterranean Sea after its pilot ejected during routine operations. That crash was ultimately blamed on a protective cover getting wedged into the plane’s engine intake.On January 4, 2022, a South Korean Air Force F-35A suffering from issues with its onboard avionics carried out an emergency belly landing. Investigators blamed a bird striking the warplane’s landing gear mid-flight. The pilot emerged unharmed.On January 24, 2022, a US Navy F-35C plunged into the South China Sea after making a hard landing on the USS Carl Vinson super carrier. The pilot and six sailors on the deck of the aircraft carrier were injured. A Navy investigation attributed the incident to pilot error.On October 19, 2022, another F-35, this one from the US Air Force, crashed at Hill Air Force Base in Utah during a training mission. The pilot ejected safely. It was later determined that turbulent air somehow confused the jet’s onboard avionics to the point where the aircraft became uncontrollable.On December 1, 2022, a Marine Corps F-35B collapsed on a military base in Japan after suffering a landing gear failure during training. No one was injured.Finally, on December 15, 2022, a US Navy F-35B crashed while attempting to perform a vertical landing at Naval Air Station Joint Reserve Base Fort Worth in Texas during testing of the jet’s systems. A “harmonic resonance” issue related to the jet’s Pratt & Whitney F135 engine was blamed, with the Pentagon halting further F-35 deliveries by Lockheed until an investigation was concluded.What’s Wrong With the F-35?Nearly 17 years after the F-35’s first flight, and eight years after its adoption into service, the F-35 continues to maintain a troublingly long list of technical bugs affecting both hardware and software. The aircraft, which has an astronomical total estimated purchase and sustainment price tag of over $1.7 trillion, and a per-plane cost of $70-$90 million, has faced years of harsh criticism from US officials, including former President Donald Trump at one point, who said the jet’s costs had spiraled “out of control.”At its heart, the F-35 is the product of an idea that metastasized in the Pentagon after the end of the Cold War, envisioning an all-in-one fighter platform which could be used by every branch of the military, equipped with vertical take-off and landing capability, and carry out a broad array of missions using a variety of onboard weapons. The do-it-all jet was supposed to replace nearly all of America’s fourth-gen fighter, strike, and ground attack aircraft, including the F-16 Falcon, the F/A-18 Hornet and Super Hornet, the AV-8B Harrier II, and others.The jet features just a single onboard engine – the aforementioned Pratt & Whitney F135, with engine-related troubles not only regularly referred to by watchdogs as a “leading driver” of the F-35’s problems remaining “mission capable,” but also making its operation over enemy territory or over the sea risky, since if something goes wrong, the plane doesn’t have a backup engine to limp home with.Throughout its production cycle, the F-35 Lightning II has suffered a dizzying and seemingly endless list of technical problems, from neck-snapping ejection seats to problems, ironically, while operating in stormy weather.In its 2023 report, the congressional Government Accountability Office revealed that the F-35 program “continues to experience schedule delays, cost growth, and late deliveries,” with procurement costs jumping by $13.4 billion since 2019, and modernization behind schedule and over budget.“As of January 2023, of the 821 open deficiencies, the program office characterized five of these as category 1 [i.e. critical issues which could jeopardize flight safety and security], and 816 as category 2, [i.e. those which could impede or constrain mission success].”In all, between December 2006 and 2023, the GAO has reported a whopping 277 category 1 and 2,467 category 2 deficiencies with the aircraft, among them serious issues like cabin over-pressurization, problems with the jets’ night vision systems, software bugs, radar issues, corrosion, ejection seats which could snap pilots’ necks, etc.Is a Culture of Largess to Blame?Sunday’s accident in South Carolina is the latest piece of F-35-related bad news for Lockheed Martin. In June, it was reported that the Pentagon had halted the delivery of any additional upgraded F-35s until major issues related to new Technology Refresh 3 (TR-3) hardware and weapons-related software were resolved. DoD F-35 program director Mike Schmidt told Congress in March that the risk assessment related to the TR-3 hardware upgrade wouldn’t be finished until April 2024.Despite the delays and array of technical problems, the weapons giant has continued to rack up generous contracts related to F-35 procurement and production. For example, in July, the US Navy ordered a $490 million package of equipment from Lockheed “to procure various material mod kits, special test/tooling equipment, as well as…product engineering” for already delivered, but defective planes. In August, Lockheed received another $606 million “fixed-price incentive (firm-target) undefinitized” contract “for long lead time materials, parts, components, and efforts to support of maintaining on-time production and delivery of 173 Lot 19 F-35 Joint Strike Fighter aircraft for Foreign Military Sales (FMS) customers and non-US Department of Defense (DOD) participants.”The terms of the contracts seem to be the culprit behind the F-35’s soaring costs (and Lockheed’s soaring profits, despite delivery of defective products), with so-called “cost-plus” and “undefinitized” contracts effectively making any overruns the buyer’s problem – i.e. that of US taxpayers, and of citizens of any country unfortunate enough to pen contracts for the planes from Lockheed.What About America’s Competitors?The worst part about the F-35’s troublesome history seems to be that the F-35 has already become ""obsolete"" in the sense that many of the US and NATO’s competitors have obtained the ability to defeat them, with Russia and China gaining capabilities to track and target the jets going back to the mid-to-late 2010s. In April, Iran announced that its engineers had created advanced radar technologies to not only detect F-35s, but identify the radar signature of individual F-35 planes, enabling the Islamic Republic to plan defensive operations accordingly.",WORLD,AMERICAS,Picture description not found,Author details not found,Author details not found,60,1305,<FreqDist with 18 samples and 775 outcomes>
Toxic explosion in Nebraska shows US unable to take issues affecting public security seriously: experts,Xu Yelu,2023-09-15,"Barely two months after an explosion in Louisiana, a train carrying toxic perchloric acid has exploded in a Nebraska rail yard on Thursday, prompting evacuation orders to be issued, as huge plumes are seen engulfing the city. Experts said the incident shows the US has been unable to take seriously and overcome major issues affecting public safety and the environment and ecology in the country.The incident happened on Union Pacific Railroad tracks in the city of North Platte. North Platte Volunteer Fire Department announced that they would order those living in the area to evacuate due to the toxic smoke from the railroad, according to media reports.In a post on social media platforms, it said that ""Emergency evacuation for the area between splinter and front North of railroad track due fire at the railroad involving heavy toxic smoke.""In a statement to DailyMail.com, Union Pacific Railroad said that an explosion occurred inside a container which resulted in several railcars catching fire. The railcar did not derail, the company said, and had been in the yard for several hours.Union Pacific said that one of the containers contained a hazardous chemical called perchloric acid, according to Daily Mail.Perchloric is a hazardous material used in food, drugs and biocidal products, as well as explosives, according to the report.Two months ago, a fire at a Louisiana chemical plant triggered explosions that shook homes several miles away and sent flames and smoke billowing into the air in mid-July, prompting emergency officials to urge a few hundred nearby residents to shelter indoors for several hours and to turn off their air conditioners, the Associated Press reported.Antiquated infrastructure and the outdated transportation were one factor. Another was a flawed system of governance in the US transport industry, experts noted. There is no doubt that the US has serious loopholes in the transportation management of hazardous substances, and the relevant error correction mechanism is in fact not effective, which means that this kind of thing will occur in the future, Li Haidong, a professor at the China Foreign Affairs University, told the Global Times on Friday.This shows that the US has been unable to take seriously and overcome serious and major issues affecting public safety and the environment and ecology in the country, Li said. ""It must be said that this is a great irony to the self-proclaimed internal governance of the most advanced country in the world.""Analysts said that the frequent occurrence of similar incidents shows that the error correction mechanism in the US has failed. Apart from this, racism and the proliferation of guns are also clear examples of the failure of error correction mechanisms, experts noted.",WORLD,AMERICAS,"A resident of East Palestine in the state of Ohio, US, angrily points during a town hall meeting held by the US

Greek scholar believes in ‘endless possibilities and vast land’ between China-Greece exchanges,Xu Liuliu,2023-09-14,"Chongqing, Sichuan, Shandong… Stelios Virvidakis expectantly plans his next China tour before a visit by the Global Times at his office in Athens, Greece. The University of Athens professor has grown far busier recently since he and four other Greek scholars launched the Center of Chinese and Greek Ancient Civilizations in February. Over the summer, the center has received two scholars from China who have given lectures on the history of China, and other visiting guests from places like Israel, who offered their views on Chinese medicine and its history, and a lecturer from France with insights in Chinese mathematics and how scholars in ancient China studied the living science.""Students found them to be very interesting and greatly appreciated the lectures,"" Virvidakis told the Global Times. ""Greece and China share so many similarities. So in my opinion, the horizon for our cooperation and exchanges is vast. There are endless possibilities which have not been explored.""Mutual learning Chinese President Xi Jinping replied to a letter from Virvidakis and four other Greek scholars earlier in 2023, extending congratulations over the founding of the Center of Chinese and Greek Ancient Civilizations.Hailing the long history of the Chinese civilization and profound influence of the ancient Greek civilization, Xi said in the letter that more than 2,000 years ago, the two civilizations shone brightly on the two ends of the Eurasian continent, jointly making a fundamental contribution to the evolution of human civilization.Greece's golden era produced many of its great philosophers and literary giants. The era coincided with a period in China in which ""a hundred schools of thought contended with each other"" and flourished together.As early as the 4th century BC, China was known to the Greeks by a beautiful name: Sērikḗ. In the 16th century, Euclid's Elements was introduced into China, paving the way for scientific exchanges between China and the West. The story of Prometheus narrated by Aeschylus was an inspiration to many Chinese revolutionaries. The Republic by Plato and Politics by Aristotle are also among the Greek classics known to have long made a name for themselves in China.In the eyes of Virvidakis, Chinese civilization has always been a culture that attracts people though the language is difficult. However, Chinese art, Chinese painting, Chinese poetry, especially love poems, even detective stories about China, are incredibly fascinating. Chinese director Zhang Yimou, and movies like Farewell My Concubine and Raise the Red Lantern starring Gong Li, are also very popular. Greek archaeologists who are interested in Chinese archeology want to know how China explores the past.In other art forms, the mythology and theater, ""we have tragedy, which is our own tradition. You have Chinese opera with music."" Actors and artists always want to study similarities and look at the differences, which is also the commitment of the center to promoting exchanges and mutual learning between the two civilizations and promoting the development of civilizations in various countries. China also has this appeal because people in the West think ""it's very different, it's exotic, something strange, but then they realize that it's beautiful for them."" So ""they find a lot of aspects that they have not thought about before in order to understand.""

Tiantan, a UNESCO World Heritage Site built in 1420, in Beijing Photo: VCGPhilosophy, a way of life There is a feeling among some people in the West that the Chinese system is different in some ways, said the professor. For instance,the European and American systems place great emphasis on individual rights, but China takes a more holistic approach in which ""harmony, social harmony is more important in sovereign.""""We are not exactly the same and there are also differences. But I don't believe in the so-called clash of civilizations theory that the clash is very deep and we can't live together with our differences,"" he told the Global Times. ""In fact we can live together and have peaceful exchanges. As I said, I don't think there is any danger of Greece threatening China or China occupying Greece.""In February, Virvidakis held a lecture at the center's launching ceremony, titled Philosophy is a Way of Life. Philosophy is not just theory, he said, noting that in ancient Greece and China it didn't mean just making theories about the universe, nature, god, or much of the unknown world. ""It told you how to 'organize' your life to feel happy and achieve harmony with others."" Western philosophy cannot be understood just by itself as there are also Chinese and Indian schools of philosophy among others. ""It is easier to see some similarities in ideas between Confucius and Socrates or Confucius and Aristotle,"" said Virvidakis, explaining why he is so fond of Chinese philosophy, especially Confucius thought. A simple question about what is a good life has a variety of answers in different philosophical theories.  But studying philosophy is practical and a way of life. Modern people don't just derive happiness from materialism. They need art and other emotionally stirring elements in life. In different parts and different cultures of the world,people can share similarities in emotion and sentiment.Virvidakis said that one of the most important reasons for his involving in such studies and exchanges was because ""I'm interested and I want to learn more. I'm a student too. When you are a teacher in your whole life, you're going to be a student.""",ARTS,CULTURE & LEISURE,The University of Athens Photo: VCG,"Reporter, Beijing","Global Times senior reporter, mainly covers the reporting of movies, TV, music and culture news.",43,880,<FreqDist with 16 samples and 473 outcomes>

 The first Saudi ambassador to Palestine Naif bin Bandar Al-Sudairi arrived in the West Bank on Tuesday, the official Palestinian news agency WAFA reported.Leading an official delegation, Al-Sudairi, the non-resident ambassador to Palestine and non-resident consul general in Jerusalem, presented his credentials to Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas at the presidency headquarters in Ramallah, it said.Al-Sudairi's arrival comes amid Israel's efforts to normalize relations with Saudi Arabia.During their meeting, Abbas welcomed Al-Sudairi and said his visit to Palestine and his appointment as Saudi ambassador to the State of Palestine would contribute to ""strengthening the strong fraternal relations that bind the two countries and the two brotherly peoples.""The Saudi ambassador said he hoped that his visit would be ""a successful beginning for strengthening relations in all fields,"" stressing his country's firm and supportive positions for the Palestinian people and their just cause.Earlier in the day, Al-Sudairi told reporters in a statement that ""the Arab Peace Initiative is the basic point in any upcoming agreement,"" after being asked about the fate of the initiative in the event of reaching a normalization deal between Saudi Arabia and Israel.The Arab Peace Initiative was launched in 2002 after it was drafted by Saudi Arabia and adopted by the Arab League.The initiative calls for an end to the conflict between Israel and Palestine and the normalization of relations between Israel and Arab states, in exchange for an Israeli withdrawal from the areas it gained since 1967 and proper settlement to the issue of Palestinian refugees.The Palestinians demanded the establishment of an independent state alongside Israel in all of the Palestinian territories occupied by Israel in 1967, including the entire West Bank and the Gaza Strip, with East Jerusalem as its capital.The Saudi ambassador also confirmed that his country intends to open a consulate in East Jerusalem soon.",PHOTO,WORLD,"Saudi ambassador to Palestine Naif bin Bandar Al-Sudairi (Front) arrives at the Palestinian foreign ministry headquarters in the West Bank city of Ramallah, on Sept. 26, 2023.(Photo: Xinhua)",Author details not found,Author details not found,12,313,<FreqDist with 15 samples and 181 outcomes>

But certain countries still cling to this mindset, blindly pursuing absolute security and monopolistic advantages, which will do nothing for their development in the long run but create a major threat to the world. It is increasingly obvious that the obsession with superior strength, and the zero-sum mentality are in conflict with the needs of our times, the white paper said, pointing out that the new era calls for new ideas. To build a global community of shared future is to pursue openness, inclusiveness, mutual benefit, equity and justice, the white paper said. The goal is not to replace one system or civilization with another. Instead, it is about countries with different social systems, ideologies, histories, shared rights, and shared responsibilities in global affairs. The vision of a global community of shared future stands on the right side of history and on the side of human progress. It introduces a new approach for international relations, provides new ideas for global governance, opens up new prospects for international exchanges and draws a new blueprint for a better world, according to the white paper. Such important vision transcends outdated mindsets such as zero-sum game, power politics, and Cold War confrontations. It has become the overall goal of China's major-country diplomacy in the new era, and a great banner that leads the trend of the times and the direction of human progress. The concept of a global community of shared future has deep roots in China's profound cultural heritage and its unique experience of modernization. It carries forward the diplomatic traditions of China and draws on the outstanding achievements of all other civilizations, the white paper said. It also manifests China's time-honored historical traditions, distinct characteristics of the times, and a wealth of humanistic values.  The white paper also pointed out the direction and plan to build a global community of shared future including pressing ahead with a new type of economic globalization in which countries need to pursue a policy of openness and explicitly oppose protectionism, the erection of fences and barriers, unilateral sanctions, and maximum-pressure tactics, so as to connect economies and jointly build an open world economy. Some countries are seeking to decouple from China, enclosing themselves in ""small yards, high fences,"" which will ultimately only backfire, the white paper said. Also, some people overstate the need to ""reduce dependence"" and ""de-risk,"" which is essentially creating new risks. The direction and the plan also include following a peaceful development plan, fostering a new type of international relations, practicing true multilateralism and promoting the common values of humanity. Over the past decade, China has contributed its strength to building a global community of shared future with firm conviction and solid actions. For instance, by July 2023, more than three-quarters of countries in the world and over 30 international organizations had signed agreements on Belt and Road cooperation with China. The BRI originated in China but the opportunities and achievements it creates belong to the whole world. It's an initiative for economic cooperation, not for geopolitical or military alliances, and it's open and inclusive process that neither targets nor excludes any party, the white paper said. Among those BRI projects, for example, the China-Laos Railway began operation on December 3, 2021, with 167 tunnels and 301 bridges built in 11 years along its total length of 1,035 kilometers. The railway construction created more than 110,000 local jobs, and helped build about 2,000 kilometers of roads and canals for villages along the railway, benefiting local people. Besides the BRI, the Global Development Initiative, the Global Security Initiative and Global Civilization Initiative have evolved into a crucial cornerstone for building a global community of shared future, offering China's solutions to major challenges pertaining to peace and development for humanity. Facing constant flare-ups of hotspot issues, China has been committed to fulfilling its role as a responsible major country, pushing for the resolution of international and regional flashpoints, such as the Korean Peninsula, Palestine, the Iranian nuclear issue, Syria and Afghanistan, the white paper said. On the Ukraine issue, China has actively promoted talks for peace, put forth four points, four things that the international community should do together and three observations, and released China's position on the political settlement of the Ukraine crisis and has dispatched the special representative of the Chinese government on Eurasian affairs to engage in extensive interactions and exchanges with stakeholders on the political settlement of the Ukraine crisis. Also, through the mediation of China, Saudi Arabia and Iran achieve historic reconciliation earlier this year, setting a fine example for countries in the region to resolve disputes and differences and achieve good neighborly relations through dialogue and consultation, and catalyzing a wave of reconciliation in the Middle East. China has also proposed a range of regional and bilateral initiatives on building communities of shared future and working with stakeholders to build consensus and expand cooperation, there by playing a constructive role in promoting regional peace and development. It also boosts international cooperation in fields including fighting the COVID-19 pandemic, addressing disorder in cyberspace governance and dealing with the global climate challenge. Over the past decade, the vision of a global community of shared future has gained broader support. More countries and people have come to the understanding that this vision serves the common interests of humanity, represents popular calls for peace, justice and progress, and can create the greatest synergy among all nations for building a better world, the white paper said.",CHINA,POLITICS,Photo: Li Xuanmin/GT,Author details not found,Author details not found,33,1000,<FreqDist with 17 samples and 603 outcomes>

F-35: Closer Look at Colossally Costly Jet That Just Can’t Seem to Stay Airborne,Sputnik,2023-09-21,"A US Marine Corps F-35B went down over South Carolina on Sunday after its pilot ejected mid-flight for reasons unknown. Why do F-35s seem so crash-prone? What’s wrong with them? And what role does the waste and fraud in the US military-industrial complex play in creating such a Frankenstein’s monster of an aircraft? Sputnik explores.Debris from the F-35B that went missing over South Carolina on September 17 was found in Williamsburg County, South Carolina, about two hours northeast of Joint Base Charleston on Monday following more than a day of frantic searching by the military. An as yet unspecified “mishap” was blamed for the accident. The pilot escaped unscathed.“The mishap is currently under investigation, and we are unable to provide additional details to preserve the integrity of the investigative process,” the Marine Corps said in a statement Monday. The Marines ordered a two-day global pause in all aerial operations, with the errant F-35B becoming the third major aviation-related accident suffered by the military branch in less than two months.Air units will be discussing “fundamentals of safe flight operations, ground safety, maintenance and flight procedures, and maintaining combat readiness,” the Marine Corps said.How Many F-35s Have Been Lost?Since it started being introduced into service with the Marines (2015), the US Air Force (2016), and the US Navy (2019) and began to be exported to foreign clients (starting with Israel in 2018), the F-35 has gained an unenviable reputation of being a costly, buggy, and crash-prone jet, with the F-35B that went down over South Carolina last week being at least the 11th Lightning II lost since 2018.On September 28, 2018, a US Marine Corps F-35B crashed during a flight near Marine Corps Air Station Beaufort in South Carolina, with a faulty fuel tube blamed for the incident. The pilot emerged unscathed.On April 9, 2019, a Japanese Self- Defense Force F-35A went down off Honshu, Japan. The pilot was killed after losing his bearings and suffering “special disorientation” mid-flight over the ocean.On May 19, 2020, a US Air Force F-35A from the 58th Fighter Squadron crashed while performing a landing at Eglin Air Force Base in western Florida. Pilot error (trying to land at excessive speed) and a mechanical defect related to a flight control glitch that left the plane’s tail unresponsive were blamed. The pilot survived.On September 29, 2020, a US Marine Corps F-35B was lost over Imperial County, California after colliding with a KC-130 tanker during midflight refueling. The tanker crew managed to bring their aircraft down for a hard landing. The F-35 pilot ejected successfully.On November 17, 2021, a British Royal Air Force F-35B plunged into the Mediterranean Sea after its pilot ejected during routine operations. That crash was ultimately blamed on a protective cover getting wedged into the plane’s engine intake.On January 4, 2022, a South Korean Air Force F-35A suffering from issues with its onboard avionics carried out an emergency belly landing. Investigators blamed a bird striking the warplane’s landing gear mid-flight. The pilot emerged unharmed.On January 24, 2022, a US Navy F-35C plunged into the South China Sea after making a hard landing on the USS Carl Vinson super carrier. The pilot and six sailors on the deck of the aircraft carrier were injured. A Navy investigation attributed the incident to pilot error.On October 19, 2022, another F-35, this one from the US Air Force, crashed at Hill Air Force Base in Utah during a training mission. The pilot ejected safely. It was later determined that turbulent air somehow confused the jet’s onboard avionics to the point where the aircraft became uncontrollable.On December 1, 2022, a Marine Corps F-35B collapsed on a military base in Japan after suffering a landing gear failure during training. No one was injured.Finally, on December 15, 2022, a US Navy F-35B crashed while attempting to perform a vertical landing at Naval Air Station Joint Reserve Base Fort Worth in Texas during testing of the jet’s systems. A “harmonic resonance” issue related to the jet’s Pratt & Whitney F135 engine was blamed, with the Pentagon halting further F-35 deliveries by Lockheed until an investigation was concluded.What’s Wrong With the F-35?Nearly 17 years after the F-35’s first flight, and eight years after its adoption into service, the F-35 continues to maintain a troublingly long list of technical bugs affecting both hardware and software. The aircraft, which has an astronomical total estimated purchase and sustainment price tag of over $1.7 trillion, and a per-plane cost of $70-$90 million, has faced years of harsh criticism from US officials, including former President Donald Trump at one point, who said the jet’s costs had spiraled “out of control.”At its heart, the F-35 is the product of an idea that metastasized in the Pentagon after the end of the Cold War, envisioning an all-in-one fighter platform which could be used by every branch of the military, equipped with vertical take-off and landing capability, and carry out a broad array of missions using a variety of onboard weapons. The do-it-all jet was supposed to replace nearly all of America’s fourth-gen fighter, strike, and ground attack aircraft, including the F-16 Falcon, the F/A-18 Hornet and Super Hornet, the AV-8B Harrier II, and others.The jet features just a single onboard engine – the aforementioned Pratt & Whitney F135, with engine-related troubles not only regularly referred to by watchdogs as a “leading driver” of the F-35’s problems remaining “mission capable,” but also making its operation over enemy territory or over the sea risky, since if something goes wrong, the plane doesn’t have a backup engine to limp home with.Throughout its production cycle, the F-35 Lightning II has suffered a dizzying and seemingly endless list of technical problems, from neck-snapping ejection seats to problems, ironically, while operating in stormy weather.In its 2023 report, the congressional Government Accountability Office revealed that the F-35 program “continues to experience schedule delays, cost growth, and late deliveries,” with procurement costs jumping by $13.4 billion since 2019, and modernization behind schedule and over budget.“As of January 2023, of the 821 open deficiencies, the program office characterized five of these as category 1 [i.e. critical issues which could jeopardize flight safety and security], and 816 as category 2, [i.e. those which could impede or constrain mission success].”In all, between December 2006 and 2023, the GAO has reported a whopping 277 category 1 and 2,467 category 2 deficiencies with the aircraft, among them serious issues like cabin over-pressurization, problems with the jets’ night vision systems, software bugs, radar issues, corrosion, ejection seats which could snap pilots’ necks, etc.Is a Culture of Largess to Blame?Sunday’s accident in South Carolina is the latest piece of F-35-related bad news for Lockheed Martin. In June, it was reported that the Pentagon had halted the delivery of any additional upgraded F-35s until major issues related to new Technology Refresh 3 (TR-3) hardware and weapons-related software were resolved. DoD F-35 program director Mike Schmidt told Congress in March that the risk assessment related to the TR-3 hardware upgrade wouldn’t be finished until April 2024.Despite the delays and array of technical problems, the weapons giant has continued to rack up generous contracts related to F-35 procurement and production. For example, in July, the US Navy ordered a $490 million package of equipment from Lockheed “to procure various material mod kits, special test/tooling equipment, as well as…product engineering” for already delivered, but defective planes. In August, Lockheed received another $606 million “fixed-price incentive (firm-target) undefinitized” contract “for long lead time materials, parts, components, and efforts to support of maintaining on-time production and delivery of 173 Lot 19 F-35 Joint Strike Fighter aircraft for Foreign Military Sales (FMS) customers and non-US Department of Defense (DOD) participants.”The terms of the contracts seem to be the culprit behind the F-35’s soaring costs (and Lockheed’s soaring profits, despite delivery of defective products), with so-called “cost-plus” and “undefinitized” contracts effectively making any overruns the buyer’s problem – i.e. that of US taxpayers, and of citizens of any country unfortunate enough to pen contracts for the planes from Lockheed.What About America’s Competitors?The worst part about the F-35’s troublesome history seems to be that the F-35 has already become ""obsolete"" in the sense that many of the US and NATO’s competitors have obtained the ability to defeat them, with Russia and China gaining capabilities to track and target the jets going back to the mid-to-late 2010s. In April, Iran announced that its engineers had created advanced radar technologies to not only detect F-35s, but identify the radar signature of individual F-35 planes, enabling the Islamic Republic to plan defensive operations accordingly.",WORLD,AMERICAS,Picture description not found,Author details not found,Author details not found,60,1305,<FreqDist with 18 samples and 775 outcomes>
Toxic explosion in Nebraska shows US unable to take issues affecting public security seriously: experts,Xu Yelu,2023-09-15,"Barely two months after an explosion in Louisiana, a train carrying toxic perchloric acid has exploded in a Nebraska rail yard on Thursday, prompting evacuation orders to be issued, as huge plumes are seen engulfing the city. Experts said the incident shows the US has been unable to take seriously and overcome major issues affecting public safety and the environment and ecology in the country.The incident happened on Union Pacific Railroad tracks in the city of North Platte. North Platte Volunteer Fire Department announced that they would order those living in the area to evacuate due to the toxic smoke from the railroad, according to media reports.In a post on social media platforms, it said that ""Emergency evacuation for the area between splinter and front North of railroad track due fire at the railroad involving heavy toxic smoke.""In a statement to DailyMail.com, Union Pacific Railroad said that an explosion occurred inside a container which resulted in several railcars catching fire. The railcar did not derail, the company said, and had been in the yard for several hours.Union Pacific said that one of the containers contained a hazardous chemical called perchloric acid, according to Daily Mail.Perchloric is a hazardous material used in food, drugs and biocidal products, as well as explosives, according to the report.Two months ago, a fire at a Louisiana chemical plant triggered explosions that shook homes several miles away and sent flames and smoke billowing into the air in mid-July, prompting emergency officials to urge a few hundred nearby residents to shelter indoors for several hours and to turn off their air conditioners, the Associated Press reported.Antiquated infrastructure and the outdated transportation were one factor. Another was a flawed system of governance in the US transport industry, experts noted. There is no doubt that the US has serious loopholes in the transportation management of hazardous substances, and the relevant error correction mechanism is in fact not effective, which means that this kind of thing will occur in the future, Li Haidong, a professor at the China Foreign Affairs University, told the Global Times on Friday.This shows that the US has been unable to take seriously and overcome serious and major issues affecting public safety and the environment and ecology in the country, Li said. ""It must be said that this is a great irony to the self-proclaimed internal governance of the most advanced country in the world.""Analysts said that the frequent occurrence of similar incidents shows that the error correction mechanism in the US has failed. Apart from this, racism and the proliferation of guns are also clear examples of the failure of error correction mechanisms, experts noted.",WORLD,AMERICAS,"A resident of East Palestine in the state of Ohio, US, angrily points during a town hall meeting held by the US

Greek scholar believes in ‘endless possibilities and vast land’ between China-Greece exchanges,Xu Liuliu,2023-09-14,"Chongqing, Sichuan, Shandong… Stelios Virvidakis expectantly plans his next China tour before a visit by the Global Times at his office in Athens, Greece. The University of Athens professor has grown far busier recently since he and four other Greek scholars launched the Center of Chinese and Greek Ancient Civilizations in February. Over the summer, the center has received two scholars from China who have given lectures on the history of China, and other visiting guests from places like Israel, who offered their views on Chinese medicine and its history, and a lecturer from France with insights in Chinese mathematics and how scholars in ancient China studied the living science.""Students found them to be very interesting and greatly appreciated the lectures,"" Virvidakis told the Global Times. ""Greece and China share so many similarities. So in my opinion, the horizon for our cooperation and exchanges is vast. There are endless possibilities which have not been explored.""Mutual learning Chinese President Xi Jinping replied to a letter from Virvidakis and four other Greek scholars earlier in 2023, extending congratulations over the founding of the Center of Chinese and Greek Ancient Civilizations.Hailing the long history of the Chinese civilization and profound influence of the ancient Greek civilization, Xi said in the letter that more than 2,000 years ago, the two civilizations shone brightly on the two ends of the Eurasian continent, jointly making a fundamental contribution to the evolution of human civilization.Greece's golden era produced many of its great philosophers and literary giants. The era coincided with a period in China in which ""a hundred schools of thought contended with each other"" and flourished together.As early as the 4th century BC, China was known to the Greeks by a beautiful name: Sērikḗ. In the 16th century, Euclid's Elements was introduced into China, paving the way for scientific exchanges between China and the West. The story of Prometheus narrated by Aeschylus was an inspiration to many Chinese revolutionaries. The Republic by Plato and Politics by Aristotle are also among the Greek classics known to have long made a name for themselves in China.In the eyes of Virvidakis, Chinese civilization has always been a culture that attracts people though the language is difficult. However, Chinese art, Chinese painting, Chinese poetry, especially love poems, even detective stories about China, are incredibly fascinating. Chinese director Zhang Yimou, and movies like Farewell My Concubine and Raise the Red Lantern starring Gong Li, are also very popular. Greek archaeologists who are interested in Chinese archeology want to know how China explores the past.In other art forms, the mythology and theater, ""we have tragedy, which is our own tradition. You have Chinese opera with music."" Actors and artists always want to study similarities and look at the differences, which is also the commitment of the center to promoting exchanges and mutual learning between the two civilizations and promoting the development of civilizations in various countries. China also has this appeal because people in the West think ""it's very different, it's exotic, something strange, but then they realize that it's beautiful for them."" So ""they find a lot of aspects that they have not thought about before in order to understand.""

Tiantan, a UNESCO World Heritage Site built in 1420, in Beijing Photo: VCGPhilosophy, a way of life There is a feeling among some people in the West that the Chinese system is different in some ways, said the professor. For instance,the European and American systems place great emphasis on individual rights, but China takes a more holistic approach in which ""harmony, social harmony is more important in sovereign.""""We are not exactly the same and there are also differences. But I don't believe in the so-called clash of civilizations theory that the clash is very deep and we can't live together with our differences,"" he told the Global Times. ""In fact we can live together and have peaceful exchanges. As I said, I don't think there is any danger of Greece threatening China or China occupying Greece.""In February, Virvidakis held a lecture at the center's launching ceremony, titled Philosophy is a Way of Life. Philosophy is not just theory, he said, noting that in ancient Greece and China it didn't mean just making theories about the universe, nature, god, or much of the unknown world. ""It told you how to 'organize' your life to feel happy and achieve harmony with others."" Western philosophy cannot be understood just by itself as there are also Chinese and Indian schools of philosophy among others. ""It is easier to see some similarities in ideas between Confucius and Socrates or Confucius and Aristotle,"" said Virvidakis, explaining why he is so fond of Chinese philosophy, especially Confucius thought. A simple question about what is a good life has a variety of answers in different philosophical theories.  But studying philosophy is practical and a way of life. Modern people don't just derive happiness from materialism. They need art and other emotionally stirring elements in life. In different parts and different cultures of the world,people can share similarities in emotion and sentiment.Virvidakis said that one of the most important reasons for his involving in such studies and exchanges was because ""I'm interested and I want to learn more. I'm a student too. When you are a teacher in your whole life, you're going to be a student.""",ARTS,CULTURE & LEISURE,The University of Athens Photo: VCG,"Reporter, Beijing","Global Times senior reporter, mainly covers the reporting of movies, TV, music and culture news.",43,880,<FreqDist with 16 samples and 473 outcomes>

 The first Saudi ambassador to Palestine Naif bin Bandar Al-Sudairi arrived in the West Bank on Tuesday, the official Palestinian news agency WAFA reported.Leading an official delegation, Al-Sudairi, the non-resident ambassador to Palestine and non-resident consul general in Jerusalem, presented his credentials to Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas at the presidency headquarters in Ramallah, it said.Al-Sudairi's arrival comes amid Israel's efforts to normalize relations with Saudi Arabia.During their meeting, Abbas welcomed Al-Sudairi and said his visit to Palestine and his appointment as Saudi ambassador to the State of Palestine would contribute to ""strengthening the strong fraternal relations that bind the two countries and the two brotherly peoples.""The Saudi ambassador said he hoped that his visit would be ""a successful beginning for strengthening relations in all fields,"" stressing his country's firm and supportive positions for the Palestinian people and their just cause.Earlier in the day, Al-Sudairi told reporters in a statement that ""the Arab Peace Initiative is the basic point in any upcoming agreement,"" after being asked about the fate of the initiative in the event of reaching a normalization deal between Saudi Arabia and Israel.The Arab Peace Initiative was launched in 2002 after it was drafted by Saudi Arabia and adopted by the Arab League.The initiative calls for an end to the conflict between Israel and Palestine and the normalization of relations between Israel and Arab states, in exchange for an Israeli withdrawal from the areas it gained since 1967 and proper settlement to the issue of Palestinian refugees.The Palestinians demanded the establishment of an independent state alongside Israel in all of the Palestinian territories occupied by Israel in 1967, including the entire West Bank and the Gaza Strip, with East Jerusalem as its capital.The Saudi ambassador also confirmed that his country intends to open a consulate in East Jerusalem soon.",PHOTO,WORLD,"Saudi ambassador to Palestine Naif bin Bandar Al-Sudairi (Front) arrives at the Palestinian foreign ministry headquarters in the West Bank city of Ramallah, on Sept. 26, 2023.(Photo: Xinhua)",Author details not found,Author details not found,12,313,<FreqDist with 15 samples and 181 outcomes>
China releases a white paper on its proposals and actions on building a global community of shared future,GT staff reporters,2023-09-26," The Chinese government released a white paper on Tuesday to introduce the theoretical base, practice and development of a global community of shared future, as by presenting China's vision of the course of human development, it counters the hegemonic thinking of certain countries that seek supremacy. The white paper, titled ""A Global Community of Shared Future: China's Proposals and Actions,"" introduced the background for China to raise the concept of a global community of shared future as the world is undergoing changes on a scale unseen in a century with various problems posing unprecedented challenges for human society. The zero-sum game is doomed to fail, the white paper said. But certain countries still cling to this mindset, blindly pursuing absolute security and monopolistic advantages, which will do nothing for their development in the long run but create a major threat to the world. It is increasingly obvious that the obsession with superior strength, and the zero-sum mentality are in conflict with the needs of our times, the white paper said, pointing out that the new era calls for new ideas. To build a global community of shared future is to pursue openness, inclusiveness, mutual benefit, equity and justice, the white paper said. The goal is not to replace one system or civilization with another. Instead, it is about countries with different social systems, ideologies, histories, shared rights, and shared responsibilities in global affairs. The vision of a global community of shared future stands on the right side of history and on the side of human progress. It introduces a new approach for international relations, provides new ideas for global governance, opens up new prospects for international exchanges and draws a new blueprint for a better world, according to the white paper. Such important vision transcends outdated mindsets such as zero-sum game, power politics, and Cold War confrontations. It has become the overall goal of China's major-country diplomacy in the new era, and a great banner that leads the trend of the times and the direction of human progress. The concept of a global community of shared future has deep roots in China's profound cultural heritage and its unique experience of modernization. It carries forward the diplomatic traditions of China and draws on the outstanding achievements of all other civilizations, the white paper said. It also manifests China's time-honored historical traditions, distinct characteristics of the times, and a wealth of humanistic values.  The white paper also pointed out the direction and plan to build a global community of shared future including pressing ahead with a new type of economic globalization in which countries need to pursue a policy of openness and explicitly oppose protectionism, the erection of fences and barriers, unilateral sanctions, and maximum-pressure tactics, so as to connect economies and jointly build an open world economy. Some countries are seeking to decouple from China, enclosing themselves in ""small yards, high fences,"" which will ultimately only backfire, the white paper said. Also, some people overstate the need to ""reduce dependence"" and ""de-risk,"" which is essentially creating new risks. The direction and the plan also include following a peaceful development plan, fostering a new type of international relations, practicing true multilateralism and promoting the common values of humanity. Over the past decade, China has contributed its strength to building a global community of shared future with firm conviction and solid actions. For instance, by July 2023, more than three-quarters of countries in the world and over 30 international organizations had signed agreements on Belt and Road cooperation with China. The BRI originated in China but the opportunities and achievements it creates belong to the whole world. It's an initiative for economic cooperation, not for geopolitical or military alliances, and it's open and inclusive process that neither targets nor excludes any party, the white paper said. Among those BRI projects, for example, the China-Laos Railway began operation on December 3, 2021, with 167 tunnels and 301 bridges built in 11 years along its total length of 1,035 kilometers. The railway construction created more than 110,000 local jobs, and helped build about 2,000 kilometers of roads and canals for villages along the railway, benefiting local people. Besides the BRI, the Global Development Initiative, the Global Security Initiative and Global Civilization Initiative have evolved into a crucial cornerstone for building a global community of shared future, offering China's solutions to major challenges pertaining to peace and development for humanity. Facing constant flare-ups of hotspot issues, China has been committed to fulfilling its role as a responsible major country, pushing for the resolution of international and regional flashpoints, such as the Korean Peninsula, Palestine, the Iranian nuclear issue, Syria and Afghanistan, the white paper said. On the Ukraine issue, China has actively promoted talks for peace, put forth four points, four things that the international community should do together and three observations, and released China's position on the political settlement of the Ukraine crisis and has dispatched the special representative of the Chinese government on Eurasian affairs to engage in extensive interactions and exchanges with stakeholders on the political settlement of the Ukraine crisis. Also, through the mediation of China, Saudi Arabia and Iran achieve historic reconciliation earlier this year, setting a fine example for countries in the region to resolve disputes and differences and achieve good neighborly relations through dialogue and consultation, and catalyzing a wave of reconciliation in the Middle East. China has also proposed a range of regional and bilateral initiatives on building communities of shared future and working with stakeholders to build consensus and expand cooperation, there by playing a constructive role in promoting regional peace and development. It also boosts international cooperation in fields including fighting the COVID-19 pandemic, addressing disorder in cyberspace governance and dealing with the global climate challenge. Over the past decade, the vision of a global community of shared future has gained broader support. More countries and people have come to the understanding that this vision serves the common interests of humanity, represents popular calls for peace, justice and progress, and can create the greatest synergy among all nations for building a better world, the white paper said.",CHINA,POLITICS,Photo: Li Xuanmin/GT,Author details not found,Author details not found,33,1000,<FreqDist with 17 samples and 603 outcomes>

F-35: Closer Look at Colossally Costly Jet That Just Can’t Seem to Stay Airborne,Sputnik,2023-09-21,"A US Marine Corps F-35B went down over South Carolina on Sunday after its pilot ejected mid-flight for reasons unknown. Why do F-35s seem so crash-prone? What’s wrong with them? And what role does the waste and fraud in the US military-industrial complex play in creating such a Frankenstein’s monster of an aircraft? Sputnik explores.Debris from the F-35B that went missing over South Carolina on September 17 was found in Williamsburg County, South Carolina, about two hours northeast of Joint Base Charleston on Monday following more than a day of frantic searching by the military. An as yet unspecified “mishap” was blamed for the accident. The pilot escaped unscathed.“The mishap is currently under investigation, and we are unable to provide additional details to preserve the integrity of the investigative process,” the Marine Corps said in a statement Monday. The Marines ordered a two-day global pause in all aerial operations, with the errant F-35B becoming the third major aviation-related accident suffered by the military branch in less than two months.Air units will be discussing “fundamentals of safe flight operations, ground safety, maintenance and flight procedures, and maintaining combat readiness,” the Marine Corps said.How Many F-35s Have Been Lost?Since it started being introduced into service with the Marines (2015), the US Air Force (2016), and the US Navy (2019) and began to be exported to foreign clients (starting with Israel in 2018), the F-35 has gained an unenviable reputation of being a costly, buggy, and crash-prone jet, with the F-35B that went down over South Carolina last week being at least the 11th Lightning II lost since 2018.On September 28, 2018, a US Marine Corps F-35B crashed during a flight near Marine Corps Air Station Beaufort in South Carolina, with a faulty fuel tube blamed for the incident. The pilot emerged unscathed.On April 9, 2019, a Japanese Self- Defense Force F-35A went down off Honshu, Japan. The pilot was killed after losing his bearings and suffering “special disorientation” mid-flight over the ocean.On May 19, 2020, a US Air Force F-35A from the 58th Fighter Squadron crashed while performing a landing at Eglin Air Force Base in western Florida. Pilot error (trying to land at excessive speed) and a mechanical defect related to a flight control glitch that left the plane’s tail unresponsive were blamed. The pilot survived.On September 29, 2020, a US Marine Corps F-35B was lost over Imperial County, California after colliding with a KC-130 tanker during midflight refueling. The tanker crew managed to bring their aircraft down for a hard landing. The F-35 pilot ejected successfully.On November 17, 2021, a British Royal Air Force F-35B plunged into the Mediterranean Sea after its pilot ejected during routine operations. That crash was ultimately blamed on a protective cover getting wedged into the plane’s engine intake.On January 4, 2022, a South Korean Air Force F-35A suffering from issues with its onboard avionics carried out an emergency belly landing. Investigators blamed a bird striking the warplane’s landing gear mid-flight. The pilot emerged unharmed.On January 24, 2022, a US Navy F-35C plunged into the South China Sea after making a hard landing on the USS Carl Vinson super carrier. The pilot and six sailors on the deck of the aircraft carrier were injured. A Navy investigation attributed the incident to pilot error.On October 19, 2022, another F-35, this one from the US Air Force, crashed at Hill Air Force Base in Utah during a training mission. The pilot ejected safely. It was later determined that turbulent air somehow confused the jet’s onboard avionics to the point where the aircraft became uncontrollable.On December 1, 2022, a Marine Corps F-35B collapsed on a military base in Japan after suffering a landing gear failure during training. No one was injured.Finally, on December 15, 2022, a US Navy F-35B crashed while attempting to perform a vertical landing at Naval Air Station Joint Reserve Base Fort Worth in Texas during testing of the jet’s systems. A “harmonic resonance” issue related to the jet’s Pratt & Whitney F135 engine was blamed, with the Pentagon halting further F-35 deliveries by Lockheed until an investigation was concluded.What’s Wrong With the F-35?Nearly 17 years after the F-35’s first flight, and eight years after its adoption into service, the F-35 continues to maintain a troublingly long list of technical bugs affecting both hardware and software. The aircraft, which has an astronomical total estimated purchase and sustainment price tag of over $1.7 trillion, and a per-plane cost of $70-$90 million, has faced years of harsh criticism from US officials, including former President Donald Trump at one point, who said the jet’s costs had spiraled “out of control.”At its heart, the F-35 is the product of an idea that metastasized in the Pentagon after the end of the Cold War, envisioning an all-in-one fighter platform which could be used by every branch of the military, equipped with vertical take-off and landing capability, and carry out a broad array of missions using a variety of onboard weapons. The do-it-all jet was supposed to replace nearly all of America’s fourth-gen fighter, strike, and ground attack aircraft, including the F-16 Falcon, the F/A-18 Hornet and Super Hornet, the AV-8B Harrier II, and others.The jet features just a single onboard engine – the aforementioned Pratt & Whitney F135, with engine-related troubles not only regularly referred to by watchdogs as a “leading driver” of the F-35’s problems remaining “mission capable,” but also making its operation over enemy territory or over the sea risky, since if something goes wrong, the plane doesn’t have a backup engine to limp home with.Throughout its production cycle, the F-35 Lightning II has suffered a dizzying and seemingly endless list of technical problems, from neck-snapping ejection seats to problems, ironically, while operating in stormy weather.In its 2023 report, the congressional Government Accountability Office revealed that the F-35 program “continues to experience schedule delays, cost growth, and late deliveries,” with procurement costs jumping by $13.4 billion since 2019, and modernization behind schedule and over budget.“As of January 2023, of the 821 open deficiencies, the program office characterized five of these as category 1 [i.e. critical issues which could jeopardize flight safety and security], and 816 as category 2, [i.e. those which could impede or constrain mission success].”In all, between December 2006 and 2023, the GAO has reported a whopping 277 category 1 and 2,467 category 2 deficiencies with the aircraft, among them serious issues like cabin over-pressurization, problems with the jets’ night vision systems, software bugs, radar issues, corrosion, ejection seats which could snap pilots’ necks, etc.Is a Culture of Largess to Blame?Sunday’s accident in South Carolina is the latest piece of F-35-related bad news for Lockheed Martin. In June, it was reported that the Pentagon had halted the delivery of any additional upgraded F-35s until major issues related to new Technology Refresh 3 (TR-3) hardware and weapons-related software were resolved. DoD F-35 program director Mike Schmidt told Congress in March that the risk assessment related to the TR-3 hardware upgrade wouldn’t be finished until April 2024.Despite the delays and array of technical problems, the weapons giant has continued to rack up generous contracts related to F-35 procurement and production. For example, in July, the US Navy ordered a $490 million package of equipment from Lockheed “to procure various material mod kits, special test/tooling equipment, as well as…product engineering” for already delivered, but defective planes. In August, Lockheed received another $606 million “fixed-price incentive (firm-target) undefinitized” contract “for long lead time materials, parts, components, and efforts to support of maintaining on-time production and delivery of 173 Lot 19 F-35 Joint Strike Fighter aircraft for Foreign Military Sales (FMS) customers and non-US Department of Defense (DOD) participants.”The terms of the contracts seem to be the culprit behind the F-35’s soaring costs (and Lockheed’s soaring profits, despite delivery of defective products), with so-called “cost-plus” and “undefinitized” contracts effectively making any overruns the buyer’s problem – i.e. that of US taxpayers, and of citizens of any country unfortunate enough to pen contracts for the planes from Lockheed.What About America’s Competitors?The worst part about the F-35’s troublesome history seems to be that the F-35 has already become ""obsolete"" in the sense that many of the US and NATO’s competitors have obtained the ability to defeat them, with Russia and China gaining capabilities to track and target the jets going back to the mid-to-late 2010s. In April, Iran announced that its engineers had created advanced radar technologies to not only detect F-35s, but identify the radar signature of individual F-35 planes, enabling the Islamic Republic to plan defensive operations accordingly.",WORLD,AMERICAS,Picture description not found,Author details not found,Author details not found,60,1305,<FreqDist with 18 samples and 775 outcomes>
Toxic explosion in Nebraska shows US unable to take issues affecting public security seriously: experts,Xu Yelu,2023-09-15,"Barely two months after an explosion in Louisiana, a train carrying toxic perchloric acid has exploded in a Nebraska rail yard on Thursday, prompting evacuation orders to be issued, as huge plumes are seen engulfing the city. Experts said the incident shows the US has been unable to take seriously and overcome major issues affecting public safety and the environment and ecology in the country.The incident happened on Union Pacific Railroad tracks in the city of North Platte. North Platte Volunteer Fire Department announced that they would order those living in the area to evacuate due to the toxic smoke from the railroad, according to media reports.In a post on social media platforms, it said that ""Emergency evacuation for the area between splinter and front North of railroad track due fire at the railroad involving heavy toxic smoke.""In a statement to DailyMail.com, Union Pacific Railroad said that an explosion occurred inside a container which resulted in several railcars catching fire. The railcar did not derail, the company said, and had been in the yard for several hours.Union Pacific said that one of the containers contained a hazardous chemical called perchloric acid, according to Daily Mail.Perchloric is a hazardous material used in food, drugs and biocidal products, as well as explosives, according to the report.Two months ago, a fire at a Louisiana chemical plant triggered explosions that shook homes several miles away and sent flames and smoke billowing into the air in mid-July, prompting emergency officials to urge a few hundred nearby residents to shelter indoors for several hours and to turn off their air conditioners, the Associated Press reported.Antiquated infrastructure and the outdated transportation were one factor. Another was a flawed system of governance in the US transport industry, experts noted. There is no doubt that the US has serious loopholes in the transportation management of hazardous substances, and the relevant error correction mechanism is in fact not effective, which means that this kind of thing will occur in the future, Li Haidong, a professor at the China Foreign Affairs University, told the Global Times on Friday.This shows that the US has been unable to take seriously and overcome serious and major issues affecting public safety and the environment and ecology in the country, Li said. ""It must be said that this is a great irony to the self-proclaimed internal governance of the most advanced country in the world.""Analysts said that the frequent occurrence of similar incidents shows that the error correction mechanism in the US has failed. Apart from this, racism and the proliferation of guns are also clear examples of the failure of error correction mechanisms, experts noted.",WORLD,AMERICAS,"A resident of East Palestine in the state of Ohio, US, angrily points during a town hall meeting held by the US

Greek scholar believes in ‘endless possibilities and vast land’ between China-Greece exchanges,Xu Liuliu,2023-09-14,"Chongqing, Sichuan, Shandong… Stelios Virvidakis expectantly plans his next China tour before a visit by the Global Times at his office in Athens, Greece. The University of Athens professor has grown far busier recently since he and four other Greek scholars launched the Center of Chinese and Greek Ancient Civilizations in February. Over the summer, the center has received two scholars from China who have given lectures on the history of China, and other visiting guests from places like Israel, who offered their views on Chinese medicine and its history, and a lecturer from France with insights in Chinese mathematics and how scholars in ancient China studied the living science.""Students found them to be very interesting and greatly appreciated the lectures,"" Virvidakis told the Global Times. ""Greece and China share so many similarities. So in my opinion, the horizon for our cooperation and exchanges is vast. There are endless possibilities which have not been explored.""Mutual learning Chinese President Xi Jinping replied to a letter from Virvidakis and four other Greek scholars earlier in 2023, extending congratulations over the founding of the Center of Chinese and Greek Ancient Civilizations.Hailing the long history of the Chinese civilization and profound influence of the ancient Greek civilization, Xi said in the letter that more than 2,000 years ago, the two civilizations shone brightly on the two ends of the Eurasian continent, jointly making a fundamental contribution to the evolution of human civilization.Greece's golden era produced many of its great philosophers and literary giants. The era coincided with a period in China in which ""a hundred schools of thought contended with each other"" and flourished together.As early as the 4th century BC, China was known to the Greeks by a beautiful name: Sērikḗ. In the 16th century, Euclid's Elements was introduced into China, paving the way for scientific exchanges between China and the West. The story of Prometheus narrated by Aeschylus was an inspiration to many Chinese revolutionaries. The Republic by Plato and Politics by Aristotle are also among the Greek classics known to have long made a name for themselves in China.In the eyes of Virvidakis, Chinese civilization has always been a culture that attracts people though the language is difficult. However, Chinese art, Chinese painting, Chinese poetry, especially love poems, even detective stories about China, are incredibly fascinating. Chinese director Zhang Yimou, and movies like Farewell My Concubine and Raise the Red Lantern starring Gong Li, are also very popular. Greek archaeologists who are interested in Chinese archeology want to know how China explores the past.In other art forms, the mythology and theater, ""we have tragedy, which is our own tradition. You have Chinese opera with music."" Actors and artists always want to study similarities and look at the differences, which is also the commitment of the center to promoting exchanges and mutual learning between the two civilizations and promoting the development of civilizations in various countries. China also has this appeal because people in the West think ""it's very different, it's exotic, something strange, but then they realize that it's beautiful for them."" So ""they find a lot of aspects that they have not thought about before in order to understand.""

Tiantan, a UNESCO World Heritage Site built in 1420, in Beijing Photo: VCGPhilosophy, a way of life There is a feeling among some people in the West that the Chinese system is different in some ways, said the professor. For instance,the European and American systems place great emphasis on individual rights, but China takes a more holistic approach in which ""harmony, social harmony is more important in sovereign.""""We are not exactly the same and there are also differences. But I don't believe in the so-called clash of civilizations theory that the clash is very deep and we can't live together with our differences,"" he told the Global Times. ""In fact we can live together and have peaceful exchanges. As I said, I don't think there is any danger of Greece threatening China or China occupying Greece.""In February, Virvidakis held a lecture at the center's launching ceremony, titled Philosophy is a Way of Life. Philosophy is not just theory, he said, noting that in ancient Greece and China it didn't mean just making theories about the universe, nature, god, or much of the unknown world. ""It told you how to 'organize' your life to feel happy and achieve harmony with others."" Western philosophy cannot be understood just by itself as there are also Chinese and Indian schools of philosophy among others. ""It is easier to see some similarities in ideas between Confucius and Socrates or Confucius and Aristotle,"" said Virvidakis, explaining why he is so fond of Chinese philosophy, especially Confucius thought. A simple question about what is a good life has a variety of answers in different philosophical theories.  But studying philosophy is practical and a way of life. Modern people don't just derive happiness from materialism. They need art and other emotionally stirring elements in life. In different parts and different cultures of the world,people can share similarities in emotion and sentiment.Virvidakis said that one of the most important reasons for his involving in such studies and exchanges was because ""I'm interested and I want to learn more. I'm a student too. When you are a teacher in your whole life, you're going to be a student.""",ARTS,CULTURE & LEISURE,The University of Athens Photo: VCG,"Reporter, Beijing","Global Times senior reporter, mainly covers the reporting of movies, TV, music and culture news.",43,880,<FreqDist with 16 samples and 473 outcomes>

 The first Saudi ambassador to Palestine Naif bin Bandar Al-Sudairi arrived in the West Bank on Tuesday, the official Palestinian news agency WAFA reported.Leading an official delegation, Al-Sudairi, the non-resident ambassador to Palestine and non-resident consul general in Jerusalem, presented his credentials to Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas at the presidency headquarters in Ramallah, it said.Al-Sudairi's arrival comes amid Israel's efforts to normalize relations with Saudi Arabia.During their meeting, Abbas welcomed Al-Sudairi and said his visit to Palestine and his appointment as Saudi ambassador to the State of Palestine would contribute to ""strengthening the strong fraternal relations that bind the two countries and the two brotherly peoples.""The Saudi ambassador said he hoped that his visit would be ""a successful beginning for strengthening relations in all fields,"" stressing his country's firm and supportive positions for the Palestinian people and their just cause.Earlier in the day, Al-Sudairi told reporters in a statement that ""the Arab Peace Initiative is the basic point in any upcoming agreement,"" after being asked about the fate of the initiative in the event of reaching a normalization deal between Saudi Arabia and Israel.The Arab Peace Initiative was launched in 2002 after it was drafted by Saudi Arabia and adopted by the Arab League.The initiative calls for an end to the conflict between Israel and Palestine and the normalization of relations between Israel and Arab states, in exchange for an Israeli withdrawal from the areas it gained since 1967 and proper settlement to the issue of Palestinian refugees.The Palestinians demanded the establishment of an independent state alongside Israel in all of the Palestinian territories occupied by Israel in 1967, including the entire West Bank and the Gaza Strip, with East Jerusalem as its capital.The Saudi ambassador also confirmed that his country intends to open a consulate in East Jerusalem soon.",PHOTO,WORLD,"Saudi ambassador to Palestine Naif bin Bandar Al-Sudairi (Front) arrives at the Palestinian foreign ministry headquarters in the West Bank city of Ramallah, on Sept. 26, 2023.(Photo: Xinhua)",Author details not found,Author details not found,12,313,<FreqDist with 15 samples and 181 outcomes>
China releases a white paper on its proposals and actions on building a global community of shared future,GT staff reporters,2023-09-26," The Chinese government released a white paper on Tuesday to introduce the theoretical base, practice and development of a global community of shared future, as by presenting China's vision of the course of human development, it counters the hegemonic thinking of certain countries that seek supremacy. The white paper, titled ""A Global Community of Shared Future: China's Proposals and Actions,"" introduced the background for China to raise the concept of a global community of shared future as the world is undergoing changes on a scale unseen in a century with various problems posing unprecedented challenges for human society. The zero-sum game is doomed to fail, the white paper said. But certain countries still cling to this mindset, blindly pursuing absolute security and monopolistic advantages, which will do nothing for their development in the long run but create a major threat to the world. It is increasingly obvious that the obsession with superior strength, and the zero-sum mentality are in conflict with the needs of our times, the white paper said, pointing out that the new era calls for new ideas. To build a global community of shared future is to pursue openness, inclusiveness, mutual benefit, equity and justice, the white paper said. The goal is not to replace one system or civilization with another. Instead, it is about countries with different social systems, ideologies, histories, shared rights, and shared responsibilities in global affairs. The vision of a global community of shared future stands on the right side of history and on the side of human progress. It introduces a new approach for international relations, provides new ideas for global governance, opens up new prospects for international exchanges and draws a new blueprint for a better world, according to the white paper. Such important vision transcends outdated mindsets such as zero-sum game, power politics, and Cold War confrontations. It has become the overall goal of China's major-country diplomacy in the new era, and a great banner that leads the trend of the times and the direction of human progress. The concept of a global community of shared future has deep roots in China's profound cultural heritage and its unique experience of modernization. It carries forward the diplomatic traditions of China and draws on the outstanding achievements of all other civilizations, the white paper said. It also manifests China's time-honored historical traditions, distinct characteristics of the times, and a wealth of humanistic values.  The white paper also pointed out the direction and plan to build a global community of shared future including pressing ahead with a new type of economic globalization in which countries need to pursue a policy of openness and explicitly oppose protectionism, the erection of fences and barriers, unilateral sanctions, and maximum-pressure tactics, so as to connect economies and jointly build an open world economy. Some countries are seeking to decouple from China, enclosing themselves in ""small yards, high fences,"" which will ultimately only backfire, the white paper said. Also, some people overstate the need to ""reduce dependence"" and ""de-risk,"" which is essentially creating new risks. The direction and the plan also include following a peaceful development plan, fostering a new type of international relations, practicing true multilateralism and promoting the common values of humanity. Over the past decade, China has contributed its strength to building a global community of shared future with firm conviction and solid actions. For instance, by July 2023, more than three-quarters of countries in the world and over 30 international organizations had signed agreements on Belt and Road cooperation with China. The BRI originated in China but the opportunities and achievements it creates belong to the whole world. It's an initiative for economic cooperation, not for geopolitical or military alliances, and it's open and inclusive process that neither targets nor excludes any party, the white paper said. Among those BRI projects, for example, the China-Laos Railway began operation on December 3, 2021, with 167 tunnels and 301 bridges built in 11 years along its total length of 1,035 kilometers. The railway construction created more than 110,000 local jobs, and helped build about 2,000 kilometers of roads and canals for villages along the railway, benefiting local people. Besides the BRI, the Global Development Initiative, the Global Security Initiative and Global Civilization Initiative have evolved into a crucial cornerstone for building a global community of shared future, offering China's solutions to major challenges pertaining to peace and development for humanity. Facing constant flare-ups of hotspot issues, China has been committed to fulfilling its role as a responsible major country, pushing for the resolution of international and regional flashpoints, such as the Korean Peninsula, Palestine, the Iranian nuclear issue, Syria and Afghanistan, the white paper said. On the Ukraine issue, China has actively promoted talks for peace, put forth four points, four things that the international community should do together and three observations, and released China's position on the political settlement of the Ukraine crisis and has dispatched the special representative of the Chinese government on Eurasian affairs to engage in extensive interactions and exchanges with stakeholders on the political settlement of the Ukraine crisis. Also, through the mediation of China, Saudi Arabia and Iran achieve historic reconciliation earlier this year, setting a fine example for countries in the region to resolve disputes and differences and achieve good neighborly relations through dialogue and consultation, and catalyzing a wave of reconciliation in the Middle East. China has also proposed a range of regional and bilateral initiatives on building communities of shared future and working with stakeholders to build consensus and expand cooperation, there by playing a constructive role in promoting regional peace and development. It also boosts international cooperation in fields including fighting the COVID-19 pandemic, addressing disorder in cyberspace governance and dealing with the global climate challenge. Over the past decade, the vision of a global community of shared future has gained broader support. More countries and people have come to the understanding that this vision serves the common interests of humanity, represents popular calls for peace, justice and progress, and can create the greatest synergy among all nations for building a better world, the white paper said.",CHINA,POLITICS,Photo: Li Xuanmin/GT,Author details not found,Author details not found,33,1000,<FreqDist with 17 samples and 603 outcomes>

F-35: Closer Look at Colossally Costly Jet That Just Can’t Seem to Stay Airborne,Sputnik,2023-09-21,"A US Marine Corps F-35B went down over South Carolina on Sunday after its pilot ejected mid-flight for reasons unknown. Why do F-35s seem so crash-prone? What’s wrong with them? And what role does the waste and fraud in the US military-industrial complex play in creating such a Frankenstein’s monster of an aircraft? Sputnik explores.Debris from the F-35B that went missing over South Carolina on September 17 was found in Williamsburg County, South Carolina, about two hours northeast of Joint Base Charleston on Monday following more than a day of frantic searching by the military. An as yet unspecified “mishap” was blamed for the accident. The pilot escaped unscathed.“The mishap is currently under investigation, and we are unable to provide additional details to preserve the integrity of the investigative process,” the Marine Corps said in a statement Monday. The Marines ordered a two-day global pause in all aerial operations, with the errant F-35B becoming the third major aviation-related accident suffered by the military branch in less than two months.Air units will be discussing “fundamentals of safe flight operations, ground safety, maintenance and flight procedures, and maintaining combat readiness,” the Marine Corps said.How Many F-35s Have Been Lost?Since it started being introduced into service with the Marines (2015), the US Air Force (2016), and the US Navy (2019) and began to be exported to foreign clients (starting with Israel in 2018), the F-35 has gained an unenviable reputation of being a costly, buggy, and crash-prone jet, with the F-35B that went down over South Carolina last week being at least the 11th Lightning II lost since 2018.On September 28, 2018, a US Marine Corps F-35B crashed during a flight near Marine Corps Air Station Beaufort in South Carolina, with a faulty fuel tube blamed for the incident. The pilot emerged unscathed.On April 9, 2019, a Japanese Self- Defense Force F-35A went down off Honshu, Japan. The pilot was killed after losing his bearings and suffering “special disorientation” mid-flight over the ocean.On May 19, 2020, a US Air Force F-35A from the 58th Fighter Squadron crashed while performing a landing at Eglin Air Force Base in western Florida. Pilot error (trying to land at excessive speed) and a mechanical defect related to a flight control glitch that left the plane’s tail unresponsive were blamed. The pilot survived.On September 29, 2020, a US Marine Corps F-35B was lost over Imperial County, California after colliding with a KC-130 tanker during midflight refueling. The tanker crew managed to bring their aircraft down for a hard landing. The F-35 pilot ejected successfully.On November 17, 2021, a British Royal Air Force F-35B plunged into the Mediterranean Sea after its pilot ejected during routine operations. That crash was ultimately blamed on a protective cover getting wedged into the plane’s engine intake.On January 4, 2022, a South Korean Air Force F-35A suffering from issues with its onboard avionics carried out an emergency belly landing. Investigators blamed a bird striking the warplane’s landing gear mid-flight. The pilot emerged unharmed.On January 24, 2022, a US Navy F-35C plunged into the South China Sea after making a hard landing on the USS Carl Vinson super carrier. The pilot and six sailors on the deck of the aircraft carrier were injured. A Navy investigation attributed the incident to pilot error.On October 19, 2022, another F-35, this one from the US Air Force, crashed at Hill Air Force Base in Utah during a training mission. The pilot ejected safely. It was later determined that turbulent air somehow confused the jet’s onboard avionics to the point where the aircraft became uncontrollable.On December 1, 2022, a Marine Corps F-35B collapsed on a military base in Japan after suffering a landing gear failure during training. No one was injured.Finally, on December 15, 2022, a US Navy F-35B crashed while attempting to perform a vertical landing at Naval Air Station Joint Reserve Base Fort Worth in Texas during testing of the jet’s systems. A “harmonic resonance” issue related to the jet’s Pratt & Whitney F135 engine was blamed, with the Pentagon halting further F-35 deliveries by Lockheed until an investigation was concluded.What’s Wrong With the F-35?Nearly 17 years after the F-35’s first flight, and eight years after its adoption into service, the F-35 continues to maintain a troublingly long list of technical bugs affecting both hardware and software. The aircraft, which has an astronomical total estimated purchase and sustainment price tag of over $1.7 trillion, and a per-plane cost of $70-$90 million, has faced years of harsh criticism from US officials, including former President Donald Trump at one point, who said the jet’s costs had spiraled “out of control.”At its heart, the F-35 is the product of an idea that metastasized in the Pentagon after the end of the Cold War, envisioning an all-in-one fighter platform which could be used by every branch of the military, equipped with vertical take-off and landing capability, and carry out a broad array of missions using a variety of onboard weapons. The do-it-all jet was supposed to replace nearly all of America’s fourth-gen fighter, strike, and ground attack aircraft, including the F-16 Falcon, the F/A-18 Hornet and Super Hornet, the AV-8B Harrier II, and others.The jet features just a single onboard engine – the aforementioned Pratt & Whitney F135, with engine-related troubles not only regularly referred to by watchdogs as a “leading driver” of the F-35’s problems remaining “mission capable,” but also making its operation over enemy territory or over the sea risky, since if something goes wrong, the plane doesn’t have a backup engine to limp home with.Throughout its production cycle, the F-35 Lightning II has suffered a dizzying and seemingly endless list of technical problems, from neck-snapping ejection seats to problems, ironically, while operating in stormy weather.In its 2023 report, the congressional Government Accountability Office revealed that the F-35 program “continues to experience schedule delays, cost growth, and late deliveries,” with procurement costs jumping by $13.4 billion since 2019, and modernization behind schedule and over budget.“As of January 2023, of the 821 open deficiencies, the program office characterized five of these as category 1 [i.e. critical issues which could jeopardize flight safety and security], and 816 as category 2, [i.e. those which could impede or constrain mission success].”In all, between December 2006 and 2023, the GAO has reported a whopping 277 category 1 and 2,467 category 2 deficiencies with the aircraft, among them serious issues like cabin over-pressurization, problems with the jets’ night vision systems, software bugs, radar issues, corrosion, ejection seats which could snap pilots’ necks, etc.Is a Culture of Largess to Blame?Sunday’s accident in South Carolina is the latest piece of F-35-related bad news for Lockheed Martin. In June, it was reported that the Pentagon had halted the delivery of any additional upgraded F-35s until major issues related to new Technology Refresh 3 (TR-3) hardware and weapons-related software were resolved. DoD F-35 program director Mike Schmidt told Congress in March that the risk assessment related to the TR-3 hardware upgrade wouldn’t be finished until April 2024.Despite the delays and array of technical problems, the weapons giant has continued to rack up generous contracts related to F-35 procurement and production. For example, in July, the US Navy ordered a $490 million package of equipment from Lockheed “to procure various material mod kits, special test/tooling equipment, as well as…product engineering” for already delivered, but defective planes. In August, Lockheed received another $606 million “fixed-price incentive (firm-target) undefinitized” contract “for long lead time materials, parts, components, and efforts to support of maintaining on-time production and delivery of 173 Lot 19 F-35 Joint Strike Fighter aircraft for Foreign Military Sales (FMS) customers and non-US Department of Defense (DOD) participants.”The terms of the contracts seem to be the culprit behind the F-35’s soaring costs (and Lockheed’s soaring profits, despite delivery of defective products), with so-called “cost-plus” and “undefinitized” contracts effectively making any overruns the buyer’s problem – i.e. that of US taxpayers, and of citizens of any country unfortunate enough to pen contracts for the planes from Lockheed.What About America’s Competitors?The worst part about the F-35’s troublesome history seems to be that the F-35 has already become ""obsolete"" in the sense that many of the US and NATO’s competitors have obtained the ability to defeat them, with Russia and China gaining capabilities to track and target the jets going back to the mid-to-late 2010s. In April, Iran announced that its engineers had created advanced radar technologies to not only detect F-35s, but identify the radar signature of individual F-35 planes, enabling the Islamic Republic to plan defensive operations accordingly.",WORLD,AMERICAS,Picture description not found,Author details not found,Author details not found,60,1305,<FreqDist with 18 samples and 775 outcomes>
Toxic explosion in Nebraska shows US unable to take issues affecting public security seriously: experts,Xu Yelu,2023-09-15,"Barely two months after an explosion in Louisiana, a train carrying toxic perchloric acid has exploded in a Nebraska rail yard on Thursday, prompting evacuation orders to be issued, as huge plumes are seen engulfing the city. Experts said the incident shows the US has been unable to take seriously and overcome major issues affecting public safety and the environment and ecology in the country.The incident happened on Union Pacific Railroad tracks in the city of North Platte. North Platte Volunteer Fire Department announced that they would order those living in the area to evacuate due to the toxic smoke from the railroad, according to media reports.In a post on social media platforms, it said that ""Emergency evacuation for the area between splinter and front North of railroad track due fire at the railroad involving heavy toxic smoke.""In a statement to DailyMail.com, Union Pacific Railroad said that an explosion occurred inside a container which resulted in several railcars catching fire. The railcar did not derail, the company said, and had been in the yard for several hours.Union Pacific said that one of the containers contained a hazardous chemical called perchloric acid, according to Daily Mail.Perchloric is a hazardous material used in food, drugs and biocidal products, as well as explosives, according to the report.Two months ago, a fire at a Louisiana chemical plant triggered explosions that shook homes several miles away and sent flames and smoke billowing into the air in mid-July, prompting emergency officials to urge a few hundred nearby residents to shelter indoors for several hours and to turn off their air conditioners, the Associated Press reported.Antiquated infrastructure and the outdated transportation were one factor. Another was a flawed system of governance in the US transport industry, experts noted. There is no doubt that the US has serious loopholes in the transportation management of hazardous substances, and the relevant error correction mechanism is in fact not effective, which means that this kind of thing will occur in the future, Li Haidong, a professor at the China Foreign Affairs University, told the Global Times on Friday.This shows that the US has been unable to take seriously and overcome serious and major issues affecting public safety and the environment and ecology in the country, Li said. ""It must be said that this is a great irony to the self-proclaimed internal governance of the most advanced country in the world.""Analysts said that the frequent occurrence of similar incidents shows that the error correction mechanism in the US has failed. Apart from this, racism and the proliferation of guns are also clear examples of the failure of error correction mechanisms, experts noted.",WORLD,AMERICAS,"A resident of East Palestine in the state of Ohio, US, angrily points during a town hall meeting held by the US

Greek scholar believes in ‘endless possibilities and vast land’ between China-Greece exchanges,Xu Liuliu,2023-09-14,"Chongqing, Sichuan, Shandong… Stelios Virvidakis expectantly plans his next China tour before a visit by the Global Times at his office in Athens, Greece. The University of Athens professor has grown far busier recently since he and four other Greek scholars launched the Center of Chinese and Greek Ancient Civilizations in February. Over the summer, the center has received two scholars from China who have given lectures on the history of China, and other visiting guests from places like Israel, who offered their views on Chinese medicine and its history, and a lecturer from France with insights in Chinese mathematics and how scholars in ancient China studied the living science.""Students found them to be very interesting and greatly appreciated the lectures,"" Virvidakis told the Global Times. ""Greece and China share so many similarities. So in my opinion, the horizon for our cooperation and exchanges is vast. There are endless possibilities which have not been explored.""Mutual learning Chinese President Xi Jinping replied to a letter from Virvidakis and four other Greek scholars earlier in 2023, extending congratulations over the founding of the Center of Chinese and Greek Ancient Civilizations.Hailing the long history of the Chinese civilization and profound influence of the ancient Greek civilization, Xi said in the letter that more than 2,000 years ago, the two civilizations shone brightly on the two ends of the Eurasian continent, jointly making a fundamental contribution to the evolution of human civilization.Greece's golden era produced many of its great philosophers and literary giants. The era coincided with a period in China in which ""a hundred schools of thought contended with each other"" and flourished together.As early as the 4th century BC, China was known to the Greeks by a beautiful name: Sērikḗ. In the 16th century, Euclid's Elements was introduced into China, paving the way for scientific exchanges between China and the West. The story of Prometheus narrated by Aeschylus was an inspiration to many Chinese revolutionaries. The Republic by Plato and Politics by Aristotle are also among the Greek classics known to have long made a name for themselves in China.In the eyes of Virvidakis, Chinese civilization has always been a culture that attracts people though the language is difficult. However, Chinese art, Chinese painting, Chinese poetry, especially love poems, even detective stories about China, are incredibly fascinating. Chinese director Zhang Yimou, and movies like Farewell My Concubine and Raise the Red Lantern starring Gong Li, are also very popular. Greek archaeologists who are interested in Chinese archeology want to know how China explores the past.In other art forms, the mythology and theater, ""we have tragedy, which is our own tradition. You have Chinese opera with music."" Actors and artists always want to study similarities and look at the differences, which is also the commitment of the center to promoting exchanges and mutual learning between the two civilizations and promoting the development of civilizations in various countries. China also has this appeal because people in the West think ""it's very different, it's exotic, something strange, but then they realize that it's beautiful for them."" So ""they find a lot of aspects that they have not thought about before in order to understand.""

Tiantan, a UNESCO World Heritage Site built in 1420, in Beijing Photo: VCGPhilosophy, a way of life There is a feeling among some people in the West that the Chinese system is different in some ways, said the professor. For instance,the European and American systems place great emphasis on individual rights, but China takes a more holistic approach in which ""harmony, social harmony is more important in sovereign.""""We are not exactly the same and there are also differences. But I don't believe in the so-called clash of civilizations theory that the clash is very deep and we can't live together with our differences,"" he told the Global Times. ""In fact we can live together and have peaceful exchanges. As I said, I don't think there is any danger of Greece threatening China or China occupying Greece.""In February, Virvidakis held a lecture at the center's launching ceremony, titled Philosophy is a Way of Life. Philosophy is not just theory, he said, noting that in ancient Greece and China it didn't mean just making theories about the universe, nature, god, or much of the unknown world. ""It told you how to 'organize' your life to feel happy and achieve harmony with others."" Western philosophy cannot be understood just by itself as there are also Chinese and Indian schools of philosophy among others. ""It is easier to see some similarities in ideas between Confucius and Socrates or Confucius and Aristotle,"" said Virvidakis, explaining why he is so fond of Chinese philosophy, especially Confucius thought. A simple question about what is a good life has a variety of answers in different philosophical theories.  But studying philosophy is practical and a way of life. Modern people don't just derive happiness from materialism. They need art and other emotionally stirring elements in life. In different parts and different cultures of the world,people can share similarities in emotion and sentiment.Virvidakis said that one of the most important reasons for his involving in such studies and exchanges was because ""I'm interested and I want to learn more. I'm a student too. When you are a teacher in your whole life, you're going to be a student.""",ARTS,CULTURE & LEISURE,The University of Athens Photo: VCG,"Reporter, Beijing","Global Times senior reporter, mainly covers the reporting of movies, TV, music and culture news.",43,880,<FreqDist with 16 samples and 473 outcomes>

 The first Saudi ambassador to Palestine Naif bin Bandar Al-Sudairi arrived in the West Bank on Tuesday, the official Palestinian news agency WAFA reported.Leading an official delegation, Al-Sudairi, the non-resident ambassador to Palestine and non-resident consul general in Jerusalem, presented his credentials to Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas at the presidency headquarters in Ramallah, it said.Al-Sudairi's arrival comes amid Israel's efforts to normalize relations with Saudi Arabia.During their meeting, Abbas welcomed Al-Sudairi and said his visit to Palestine and his appointment as Saudi ambassador to the State of Palestine would contribute to ""strengthening the strong fraternal relations that bind the two countries and the two brotherly peoples.""The Saudi ambassador said he hoped that his visit would be ""a successful beginning for strengthening relations in all fields,"" stressing his country's firm and supportive positions for the Palestinian people and their just cause.Earlier in the day, Al-Sudairi told reporters in a statement that ""the Arab Peace Initiative is the basic point in any upcoming agreement,"" after being asked about the fate of the initiative in the event of reaching a normalization deal between Saudi Arabia and Israel.The Arab Peace Initiative was launched in 2002 after it was drafted by Saudi Arabia and adopted by the Arab League.The initiative calls for an end to the conflict between Israel and Palestine and the normalization of relations between Israel and Arab states, in exchange for an Israeli withdrawal from the areas it gained since 1967 and proper settlement to the issue of Palestinian refugees.The Palestinians demanded the establishment of an independent state alongside Israel in all of the Palestinian territories occupied by Israel in 1967, including the entire West Bank and the Gaza Strip, with East Jerusalem as its capital.The Saudi ambassador also confirmed that his country intends to open a consulate in East Jerusalem soon.",PHOTO,WORLD,"Saudi ambassador to Palestine Naif bin Bandar Al-Sudairi (Front) arrives at the Palestinian foreign ministry headquarters in the West Bank city of Ramallah, on Sept. 26, 2023.(Photo: Xinhua)",Author details not found,Author details not found,12,313,<FreqDist with 15 samples and 181 outcomes>
China releases a white paper on its proposals and actions on building a global community of shared future,GT staff reporters,2023-09-26," The Chinese government released a white paper on Tuesday to introduce the theoretical base, practice and development of a global community of shared future, as by presenting China's vision of the course of human development, it counters the hegemonic thinking of certain countries that seek supremacy. The white paper, titled ""A Global Community of Shared Future: China's Proposals and Actions,"" introduced the background for China to raise the concept of a global community of shared future as the world is undergoing changes on a scale unseen in a century with various problems posing unprecedented challenges for human society. The zero-sum game is doomed to fail, the white paper said. But certain countries still cling to this mindset, blindly pursuing absolute security and monopolistic advantages, which will do nothing for their development in the long run but create a major threat to the world. It is increasingly obvious that the obsession with superior strength, and the zero-sum mentality are in conflict with the needs of our times, the white paper said, pointing out that the new era calls for new ideas. To build a global community of shared future is to pursue openness, inclusiveness, mutual benefit, equity and justice, the white paper said. The goal is not to replace one system or civilization with another. Instead, it is about countries with different social systems, ideologies, histories, shared rights, and shared responsibilities in global affairs. The vision of a global community of shared future stands on the right side of history and on the side of human progress. It introduces a new approach for international relations, provides new ideas for global governance, opens up new prospects for international exchanges and draws a new blueprint for a better world, according to the white paper. Such important vision transcends outdated mindsets such as zero-sum game, power politics, and Cold War confrontations. It has become the overall goal of China's major-country diplomacy in the new era, and a great banner that leads the trend of the times and the direction of human progress. The concept of a global community of shared future has deep roots in China's profound cultural heritage and its unique experience of modernization. It carries forward the diplomatic traditions of China and draws on the outstanding achievements of all other civilizations, the white paper said. It also manifests China's time-honored historical traditions, distinct characteristics of the times, and a wealth of humanistic values.  The white paper also pointed out the direction and plan to build a global community of shared future including pressing ahead with a new type of economic globalization in which countries need to pursue a policy of openness and explicitly oppose protectionism, the erection of fences and barriers, unilateral sanctions, and maximum-pressure tactics, so as to connect economies and jointly build an open world economy. Some countries are seeking to decouple from China, enclosing themselves in ""small yards, high fences,"" which will ultimately only backfire, the white paper said. Also, some people overstate the need to ""reduce dependence"" and ""de-risk,"" which is essentially creating new risks. The direction and the plan also include following a peaceful development plan, fostering a new type of international relations, practicing true multilateralism and promoting the common values of humanity. Over the past decade, China has contributed its strength to building a global community of shared future with firm conviction and solid actions. For instance, by July 2023, more than three-quarters of countries in the world and over 30 international organizations had signed agreements on Belt and Road cooperation with China. The BRI originated in China but the opportunities and achievements it creates belong to the whole world. It's an initiative for economic cooperation, not for geopolitical or military alliances, and it's open and inclusive process that neither targets nor excludes any party, the white paper said. Among those BRI projects, for example, the China-Laos Railway began operation on December 3, 2021, with 167 tunnels and 301 bridges built in 11 years along its total length of 1,035 kilometers. The railway construction created more than 110,000 local jobs, and helped build about 2,000 kilometers of roads and canals for villages along the railway, benefiting local people. Besides the BRI, the Global Development Initiative, the Global Security Initiative and Global Civilization Initiative have evolved into a crucial cornerstone for building a global community of shared future, offering China's solutions to major challenges pertaining to peace and development for humanity. Facing constant flare-ups of hotspot issues, China has been committed to fulfilling its role as a responsible major country, pushing for the resolution of international and regional flashpoints, such as the Korean Peninsula, Palestine, the Iranian nuclear issue, Syria and Afghanistan, the white paper said. On the Ukraine issue, China has actively promoted talks for peace, put forth four points, four things that the international community should do together and three observations, and released China's position on the political settlement of the Ukraine crisis and has dispatched the special representative of the Chinese government on Eurasian affairs to engage in extensive interactions and exchanges with stakeholders on the political settlement of the Ukraine crisis. Also, through the mediation of China, Saudi Arabia and Iran achieve historic reconciliation earlier this year, setting a fine example for countries in the region to resolve disputes and differences and achieve good neighborly relations through dialogue and consultation, and catalyzing a wave of reconciliation in the Middle East. China has also proposed a range of regional and bilateral initiatives on building communities of shared future and working with stakeholders to build consensus and expand cooperation, there by playing a constructive role in promoting regional peace and development. It also boosts international cooperation in fields including fighting the COVID-19 pandemic, addressing disorder in cyberspace governance and dealing with the global climate challenge. Over the past decade, the vision of a global community of shared future has gained broader support. More countries and people have come to the understanding that this vision serves the common interests of humanity, represents popular calls for peace, justice and progress, and can create the greatest synergy among all nations for building a better world, the white paper said.",CHINA,POLITICS,Photo: Li Xuanmin/GT,Author details not found,Author details not found,33,1000,<FreqDist with 17 samples and 603 outcomes>

F-35: Closer Look at Colossally Costly Jet That Just Can’t Seem to Stay Airborne,Sputnik,2023-09-21,"A US Marine Corps F-35B went down over South Carolina on Sunday after its pilot ejected mid-flight for reasons unknown. Why do F-35s seem so crash-prone? What’s wrong with them? And what role does the waste and fraud in the US military-industrial complex play in creating such a Frankenstein’s monster of an aircraft? Sputnik explores.Debris from the F-35B that went missing over South Carolina on September 17 was found in Williamsburg County, South Carolina, about two hours northeast of Joint Base Charleston on Monday following more than a day of frantic searching by the military. An as yet unspecified “mishap” was blamed for the accident. The pilot escaped unscathed.“The mishap is currently under investigation, and we are unable to provide additional details to preserve the integrity of the investigative process,” the Marine Corps said in a statement Monday. The Marines ordered a two-day global pause in all aerial operations, with the errant F-35B becoming the third major aviation-related accident suffered by the military branch in less than two months.Air units will be discussing “fundamentals of safe flight operations, ground safety, maintenance and flight procedures, and maintaining combat readiness,” the Marine Corps said.How Many F-35s Have Been Lost?Since it started being introduced into service with the Marines (2015), the US Air Force (2016), and the US Navy (2019) and began to be exported to foreign clients (starting with Israel in 2018), the F-35 has gained an unenviable reputation of being a costly, buggy, and crash-prone jet, with the F-35B that went down over South Carolina last week being at least the 11th Lightning II lost since 2018.On September 28, 2018, a US Marine Corps F-35B crashed during a flight near Marine Corps Air Station Beaufort in South Carolina, with a faulty fuel tube blamed for the incident. The pilot emerged unscathed.On April 9, 2019, a Japanese Self- Defense Force F-35A went down off Honshu, Japan. The pilot was killed after losing his bearings and suffering “special disorientation” mid-flight over the ocean.On May 19, 2020, a US Air Force F-35A from the 58th Fighter Squadron crashed while performing a landing at Eglin Air Force Base in western Florida. Pilot error (trying to land at excessive speed) and a mechanical defect related to a flight control glitch that left the plane’s tail unresponsive were blamed. The pilot survived.On September 29, 2020, a US Marine Corps F-35B was lost over Imperial County, California after colliding with a KC-130 tanker during midflight refueling. The tanker crew managed to bring their aircraft down for a hard landing. The F-35 pilot ejected successfully.On November 17, 2021, a British Royal Air Force F-35B plunged into the Mediterranean Sea after its pilot ejected during routine operations. That crash was ultimately blamed on a protective cover getting wedged into the plane’s engine intake.On January 4, 2022, a South Korean Air Force F-35A suffering from issues with its onboard avionics carried out an emergency belly landing. Investigators blamed a bird striking the warplane’s landing gear mid-flight. The pilot emerged unharmed.On January 24, 2022, a US Navy F-35C plunged into the South China Sea after making a hard landing on the USS Carl Vinson super carrier. The pilot and six sailors on the deck of the aircraft carrier were injured. A Navy investigation attributed the incident to pilot error.On October 19, 2022, another F-35, this one from the US Air Force, crashed at Hill Air Force Base in Utah during a training mission. The pilot ejected safely. It was later determined that turbulent air somehow confused the jet’s onboard avionics to the point where the aircraft became uncontrollable.On December 1, 2022, a Marine Corps F-35B collapsed on a military base in Japan after suffering a landing gear failure during training. No one was injured.Finally, on December 15, 2022, a US Navy F-35B crashed while attempting to perform a vertical landing at Naval Air Station Joint Reserve Base Fort Worth in Texas during testing of the jet’s systems. A “harmonic resonance” issue related to the jet’s Pratt & Whitney F135 engine was blamed, with the Pentagon halting further F-35 deliveries by Lockheed until an investigation was concluded.What’s Wrong With the F-35?Nearly 17 years after the F-35’s first flight, and eight years after its adoption into service, the F-35 continues to maintain a troublingly long list of technical bugs affecting both hardware and software. The aircraft, which has an astronomical total estimated purchase and sustainment price tag of over $1.7 trillion, and a per-plane cost of $70-$90 million, has faced years of harsh criticism from US officials, including former President Donald Trump at one point, who said the jet’s costs had spiraled “out of control.”At its heart, the F-35 is the product of an idea that metastasized in the Pentagon after the end of the Cold War, envisioning an all-in-one fighter platform which could be used by every branch of the military, equipped with vertical take-off and landing capability, and carry out a broad array of missions using a variety of onboard weapons. The do-it-all jet was supposed to replace nearly all of America’s fourth-gen fighter, strike, and ground attack aircraft, including the F-16 Falcon, the F/A-18 Hornet and Super Hornet, the AV-8B Harrier II, and others.The jet features just a single onboard engine – the aforementioned Pratt & Whitney F135, with engine-related troubles not only regularly referred to by watchdogs as a “leading driver” of the F-35’s problems remaining “mission capable,” but also making its operation over enemy territory or over the sea risky, since if something goes wrong, the plane doesn’t have a backup engine to limp home with.Throughout its production cycle, the F-35 Lightning II has suffered a dizzying and seemingly endless list of technical problems, from neck-snapping ejection seats to problems, ironically, while operating in stormy weather.In its 2023 report, the congressional Government Accountability Office revealed that the F-35 program “continues to experience schedule delays, cost growth, and late deliveries,” with procurement costs jumping by $13.4 billion since 2019, and modernization behind schedule and over budget.“As of January 2023, of the 821 open deficiencies, the program office characterized five of these as category 1 [i.e. critical issues which could jeopardize flight safety and security], and 816 as category 2, [i.e. those which could impede or constrain mission success].”In all, between December 2006 and 2023, the GAO has reported a whopping 277 category 1 and 2,467 category 2 deficiencies with the aircraft, among them serious issues like cabin over-pressurization, problems with the jets’ night vision systems, software bugs, radar issues, corrosion, ejection seats which could snap pilots’ necks, etc.Is a Culture of Largess to Blame?Sunday’s accident in South Carolina is the latest piece of F-35-related bad news for Lockheed Martin. In June, it was reported that the Pentagon had halted the delivery of any additional upgraded F-35s until major issues related to new Technology Refresh 3 (TR-3) hardware and weapons-related software were resolved. DoD F-35 program director Mike Schmidt told Congress in March that the risk assessment related to the TR-3 hardware upgrade wouldn’t be finished until April 2024.Despite the delays and array of technical problems, the weapons giant has continued to rack up generous contracts related to F-35 procurement and production. For example, in July, the US Navy ordered a $490 million package of equipment from Lockheed “to procure various material mod kits, special test/tooling equipment, as well as…product engineering” for already delivered, but defective planes. In August, Lockheed received another $606 million “fixed-price incentive (firm-target) undefinitized” contract “for long lead time materials, parts, components, and efforts to support of maintaining on-time production and delivery of 173 Lot 19 F-35 Joint Strike Fighter aircraft for Foreign Military Sales (FMS) customers and non-US Department of Defense (DOD) participants.”The terms of the contracts seem to be the culprit behind the F-35’s soaring costs (and Lockheed’s soaring profits, despite delivery of defective products), with so-called “cost-plus” and “undefinitized” contracts effectively making any overruns the buyer’s problem – i.e. that of US taxpayers, and of citizens of any country unfortunate enough to pen contracts for the planes from Lockheed.What About America’s Competitors?The worst part about the F-35’s troublesome history seems to be that the F-35 has already become ""obsolete"" in the sense that many of the US and NATO’s competitors have obtained the ability to defeat them, with Russia and China gaining capabilities to track and target the jets going back to the mid-to-late 2010s. In April, Iran announced that its engineers had created advanced radar technologies to not only detect F-35s, but identify the radar signature of individual F-35 planes, enabling the Islamic Republic to plan defensive operations accordingly.",WORLD,AMERICAS,Picture description not found,Author details not found,Author details not found,60,1305,<FreqDist with 18 samples and 775 outcomes>
Toxic explosion in Nebraska shows US unable to take issues affecting public security seriously: experts,Xu Yelu,2023-09-15,"Barely two months after an explosion in Louisiana, a train carrying toxic perchloric acid has exploded in a Nebraska rail yard on Thursday, prompting evacuation orders to be issued, as huge plumes are seen engulfing the city. Experts said the incident shows the US has been unable to take seriously and overcome major issues affecting public safety and the environment and ecology in the country.The incident happened on Union Pacific Railroad tracks in the city of North Platte. North Platte Volunteer Fire Department announced that they would order those living in the area to evacuate due to the toxic smoke from the railroad, according to media reports.In a post on social media platforms, it said that ""Emergency evacuation for the area between splinter and front North of railroad track due fire at the railroad involving heavy toxic smoke.""In a statement to DailyMail.com, Union Pacific Railroad said that an explosion occurred inside a container which resulted in several railcars catching fire. The railcar did not derail, the company said, and had been in the yard for several hours.Union Pacific said that one of the containers contained a hazardous chemical called perchloric acid, according to Daily Mail.Perchloric is a hazardous material used in food, drugs and biocidal products, as well as explosives, according to the report.Two months ago, a fire at a Louisiana chemical plant triggered explosions that shook homes several miles away and sent flames and smoke billowing into the air in mid-July, prompting emergency officials to urge a few hundred nearby residents to shelter indoors for several hours and to turn off their air conditioners, the Associated Press reported.Antiquated infrastructure and the outdated transportation were one factor. Another was a flawed system of governance in the US transport industry, experts noted. There is no doubt that the US has serious loopholes in the transportation management of hazardous substances, and the relevant error correction mechanism is in fact not effective, which means that this kind of thing will occur in the future, Li Haidong, a professor at the China Foreign Affairs University, told the Global Times on Friday.This shows that the US has been unable to take seriously and overcome serious and major issues affecting public safety and the environment and ecology in the country, Li said. ""It must be said that this is a great irony to the self-proclaimed internal governance of the most advanced country in the world.""Analysts said that the frequent occurrence of similar incidents shows that the error correction mechanism in the US has failed. Apart from this, racism and the proliferation of guns are also clear examples of the failure of error correction mechanisms, experts noted.",WORLD,AMERICAS,"A resident of East Palestine in the state of Ohio, US, angrily points during a town hall meeting held by the US

Greek scholar believes in ‘endless possibilities and vast land’ between China-Greece exchanges,Xu Liuliu,2023-09-14,"Chongqing, Sichuan, Shandong… Stelios Virvidakis expectantly plans his next China tour before a visit by the Global Times at his office in Athens, Greece. The University of Athens professor has grown far busier recently since he and four other Greek scholars launched the Center of Chinese and Greek Ancient Civilizations in February. Over the summer, the center has received two scholars from China who have given lectures on the history of China, and other visiting guests from places like Israel, who offered their views on Chinese medicine and its history, and a lecturer from France with insights in Chinese mathematics and how scholars in ancient China studied the living science.""Students found them to be very interesting and greatly appreciated the lectures,"" Virvidakis told the Global Times. ""Greece and China share so many similarities. So in my opinion, the horizon for our cooperation and exchanges is vast. There are endless possibilities which have not been explored.""Mutual learning Chinese President Xi Jinping replied to a letter from Virvidakis and four other Greek scholars earlier in 2023, extending congratulations over the founding of the Center of Chinese and Greek Ancient Civilizations.Hailing the long history of the Chinese civilization and profound influence of the ancient Greek civilization, Xi said in the letter that more than 2,000 years ago, the two civilizations shone brightly on the two ends of the Eurasian continent, jointly making a fundamental contribution to the evolution of human civilization.Greece's golden era produced many of its great philosophers and literary giants. The era coincided with a period in China in which ""a hundred schools of thought contended with each other"" and flourished together.As early as the 4th century BC, China was known to the Greeks by a beautiful name: Sērikḗ. In the 16th century, Euclid's Elements was introduced into China, paving the way for scientific exchanges between China and the West. The story of Prometheus narrated by Aeschylus was an inspiration to many Chinese revolutionaries. The Republic by Plato and Politics by Aristotle are also among the Greek classics known to have long made a name for themselves in China.In the eyes of Virvidakis, Chinese civilization has always been a culture that attracts people though the language is difficult. However, Chinese art, Chinese painting, Chinese poetry, especially love poems, even detective stories about China, are incredibly fascinating. Chinese director Zhang Yimou, and movies like Farewell My Concubine and Raise the Red Lantern starring Gong Li, are also very popular. Greek archaeologists who are interested in Chinese archeology want to know how China explores the past.In other art forms, the mythology and theater, ""we have tragedy, which is our own tradition. You have Chinese opera with music."" Actors and artists always want to study similarities and look at the differences, which is also the commitment of the center to promoting exchanges and mutual learning between the two civilizations and promoting the development of civilizations in various countries. China also has this appeal because people in the West think ""it's very different, it's exotic, something strange, but then they realize that it's beautiful for them."" So ""they find a lot of aspects that they have not thought about before in order to understand.""

Tiantan, a UNESCO World Heritage Site built in 1420, in Beijing Photo: VCGPhilosophy, a way of life There is a feeling among some people in the West that the Chinese system is different in some ways, said the professor. For instance,the European and American systems place great emphasis on individual rights, but China takes a more holistic approach in which ""harmony, social harmony is more important in sovereign.""""We are not exactly the same and there are also differences. But I don't believe in the so-called clash of civilizations theory that the clash is very deep and we can't live together with our differences,"" he told the Global Times. ""In fact we can live together and have peaceful exchanges. As I said, I don't think there is any danger of Greece threatening China or China occupying Greece.""In February, Virvidakis held a lecture at the center's launching ceremony, titled Philosophy is a Way of Life. Philosophy is not just theory, he said, noting that in ancient Greece and China it didn't mean just making theories about the universe, nature, god, or much of the unknown world. ""It told you how to 'organize' your life to feel happy and achieve harmony with others."" Western philosophy cannot be understood just by itself as there are also Chinese and Indian schools of philosophy among others. ""It is easier to see some similarities in ideas between Confucius and Socrates or Confucius and Aristotle,"" said Virvidakis, explaining why he is so fond of Chinese philosophy, especially Confucius thought. A simple question about what is a good life has a variety of answers in different philosophical theories.  But studying philosophy is practical and a way of life. Modern people don't just derive happiness from materialism. They need art and other emotionally stirring elements in life. In different parts and different cultures of the world,people can share similarities in emotion and sentiment.Virvidakis said that one of the most important reasons for his involving in such studies and exchanges was because ""I'm interested and I want to learn more. I'm a student too. When you are a teacher in your whole life, you're going to be a student.""",ARTS,CULTURE & LEISURE,The University of Athens Photo: VCG,"Reporter, Beijing","Global Times senior reporter, mainly covers the reporting of movies, TV, music and culture news.",43,880,<FreqDist with 16 samples and 473 outcomes>

 The first Saudi ambassador to Palestine Naif bin Bandar Al-Sudairi arrived in the West Bank on Tuesday, the official Palestinian news agency WAFA reported.Leading an official delegation, Al-Sudairi, the non-resident ambassador to Palestine and non-resident consul general in Jerusalem, presented his credentials to Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas at the presidency headquarters in Ramallah, it said.Al-Sudairi's arrival comes amid Israel's efforts to normalize relations with Saudi Arabia.During their meeting, Abbas welcomed Al-Sudairi and said his visit to Palestine and his appointment as Saudi ambassador to the State of Palestine would contribute to ""strengthening the strong fraternal relations that bind the two countries and the two brotherly peoples.""The Saudi ambassador said he hoped that his visit would be ""a successful beginning for strengthening relations in all fields,"" stressing his country's firm and supportive positions for the Palestinian people and their just cause.Earlier in the day, Al-Sudairi told reporters in a statement that ""the Arab Peace Initiative is the basic point in any upcoming agreement,"" after being asked about the fate of the initiative in the event of reaching a normalization deal between Saudi Arabia and Israel.The Arab Peace Initiative was launched in 2002 after it was drafted by Saudi Arabia and adopted by the Arab League.The initiative calls for an end to the conflict between Israel and Palestine and the normalization of relations between Israel and Arab states, in exchange for an Israeli withdrawal from the areas it gained since 1967 and proper settlement to the issue of Palestinian refugees.The Palestinians demanded the establishment of an independent state alongside Israel in all of the Palestinian territories occupied by Israel in 1967, including the entire West Bank and the Gaza Strip, with East Jerusalem as its capital.The Saudi ambassador also confirmed that his country intends to open a consulate in East Jerusalem soon.",PHOTO,WORLD,"Saudi ambassador to Palestine Naif bin Bandar Al-Sudairi (Front) arrives at the Palestinian foreign ministry headquarters in the West Bank city of Ramallah, on Sept. 26, 2023.(Photo: Xinhua)",Author details not found,Author details not found,12,313,<FreqDist with 15 samples and 181 outcomes>
China releases a white paper on its proposals and actions on building a global community of shared future,GT staff reporters,2023-09-26," The Chinese government released a white paper on Tuesday to introduce the theoretical base, practice and development of a global community of shared future, as by presenting China's vision of the course of human development, it counters the hegemonic thinking of certain countries that seek supremacy. The white paper, titled ""A Global Community of Shared Future: China's Proposals and Actions,"" introduced the background for China to raise the concept of a global community of shared future as the world is undergoing changes on a scale unseen in a century with various problems posing unprecedented challenges for human society. The zero-sum game is doomed to fail, the white paper said. But certain countries still cling to this mindset, blindly pursuing absolute security and monopolistic advantages, which will do nothing for their development in the long run but create a major threat to the world. It is increasingly obvious that the obsession with superior strength, and the zero-sum mentality are in conflict with the needs of our times, the white paper said, pointing out that the new era calls for new ideas. To build a global community of shared future is to pursue openness, inclusiveness, mutual benefit, equity and justice, the white paper said. The goal is not to replace one system or civilization with another. Instead, it is about countries with different social systems, ideologies, histories, shared rights, and shared responsibilities in global affairs. The vision of a global community of shared future stands on the right side of history and on the side of human progress. It introduces a new approach for international relations, provides new ideas for global governance, opens up new prospects for international exchanges and draws a new blueprint for a better world, according to the white paper. Such important vision transcends outdated mindsets such as zero-sum game, power politics, and Cold War confrontations. It has become the overall goal of China's major-country diplomacy in the new era, and a great banner that leads the trend of the times and the direction of human progress. The concept of a global community of shared future has deep roots in China's profound cultural heritage and its unique experience of modernization. It carries forward the diplomatic traditions of China and draws on the outstanding achievements of all other civilizations, the white paper said. It also manifests China's time-honored historical traditions, distinct characteristics of the times, and a wealth of humanistic values.  The white paper also pointed out the direction and plan to build a global community of shared future including pressing ahead with a new type of economic globalization in which countries need to pursue a policy of openness and explicitly oppose protectionism, the erection of fences and barriers, unilateral sanctions, and maximum-pressure tactics, so as to connect economies and jointly build an open world economy. Some countries are seeking to decouple from China, enclosing themselves in ""small yards, high fences,"" which will ultimately only backfire, the white paper said. Also, some people overstate the need to ""reduce dependence"" and ""de-risk,"" which is essentially creating new risks. The direction and the plan also include following a peaceful development plan, fostering a new type of international relations, practicing true multilateralism and promoting the common values of humanity. Over the past decade, China has contributed its strength to building a global community of shared future with firm conviction and solid actions. For instance, by July 2023, more than three-quarters of countries in the world and over 30 international organizations had signed agreements on Belt and Road cooperation with China. The BRI originated in China but the opportunities and achievements it creates belong to the whole world. It's an initiative for economic cooperation, not for geopolitical or military alliances, and it's open and inclusive process that neither targets nor excludes any party, the white paper said. Among those BRI projects, for example, the China-Laos Railway began operation on December 3, 2021, with 167 tunnels and 301 bridges built in 11 years along its total length of 1,035 kilometers. The railway construction created more than 110,000 local jobs, and helped build about 2,000 kilometers of roads and canals for villages along the railway, benefiting local people. Besides the BRI, the Global Development Initiative, the Global Security Initiative and Global Civilization Initiative have evolved into a crucial cornerstone for building a global community of shared future, offering China's solutions to major challenges pertaining to peace and development for humanity. Facing constant flare-ups of hotspot issues, China has been committed to fulfilling its role as a responsible major country, pushing for the resolution of international and regional flashpoints, such as the Korean Peninsula, Palestine, the Iranian nuclear issue, Syria and Afghanistan, the white paper said. On the Ukraine issue, China has actively promoted talks for peace, put forth four points, four things that the international community should do together and three observations, and released China's position on the political settlement of the Ukraine crisis and has dispatched the special representative of the Chinese government on Eurasian affairs to engage in extensive interactions and exchanges with stakeholders on the political settlement of the Ukraine crisis. Also, through the mediation of China, Saudi Arabia and Iran achieve historic reconciliation earlier this year, setting a fine example for countries in the region to resolve disputes and differences and achieve good neighborly relations through dialogue and consultation, and catalyzing a wave of reconciliation in the Middle East. China has also proposed a range of regional and bilateral initiatives on building communities of shared future and working with stakeholders to build consensus and expand cooperation, there by playing a constructive role in promoting regional peace and development. It also boosts international cooperation in fields including fighting the COVID-19 pandemic, addressing disorder in cyberspace governance and dealing with the global climate challenge. Over the past decade, the vision of a global community of shared future has gained broader support. More countries and people have come to the understanding that this vision serves the common interests of humanity, represents popular calls for peace, justice and progress, and can create the greatest synergy among all nations for building a better world, the white paper said.",CHINA,POLITICS,Photo: Li Xuanmin/GT,Author details not found,Author details not found,33,1000,<FreqDist with 17 samples and 603 outcomes>

F-35: Closer Look at Colossally Costly Jet That Just Can’t Seem to Stay Airborne,Sputnik,2023-09-21,"A US Marine Corps F-35B went down over South Carolina on Sunday after its pilot ejected mid-flight for reasons unknown. Why do F-35s seem so crash-prone? What’s wrong with them? And what role does the waste and fraud in the US military-industrial complex play in creating such a Frankenstein’s monster of an aircraft? Sputnik explores.Debris from the F-35B that went missing over South Carolina on September 17 was found in Williamsburg County, South Carolina, about two hours northeast of Joint Base Charleston on Monday following more than a day of frantic searching by the military. An as yet unspecified “mishap” was blamed for the accident. The pilot escaped unscathed.“The mishap is currently under investigation, and we are unable to provide additional details to preserve the integrity of the investigative process,” the Marine Corps said in a statement Monday. The Marines ordered a two-day global pause in all aerial operations, with the errant F-35B becoming the third major aviation-related accident suffered by the military branch in less than two months.Air units will be discussing “fundamentals of safe flight operations, ground safety, maintenance and flight procedures, and maintaining combat readiness,” the Marine Corps said.How Many F-35s Have Been Lost?Since it started being introduced into service with the Marines (2015), the US Air Force (2016), and the US Navy (2019) and began to be exported to foreign clients (starting with Israel in 2018), the F-35 has gained an unenviable reputation of being a costly, buggy, and crash-prone jet, with the F-35B that went down over South Carolina last week being at least the 11th Lightning II lost since 2018.On September 28, 2018, a US Marine Corps F-35B crashed during a flight near Marine Corps Air Station Beaufort in South Carolina, with a faulty fuel tube blamed for the incident. The pilot emerged unscathed.On April 9, 2019, a Japanese Self- Defense Force F-35A went down off Honshu, Japan. The pilot was killed after losing his bearings and suffering “special disorientation” mid-flight over the ocean.On May 19, 2020, a US Air Force F-35A from the 58th Fighter Squadron crashed while performing a landing at Eglin Air Force Base in western Florida. Pilot error (trying to land at excessive speed) and a mechanical defect related to a flight control glitch that left the plane’s tail unresponsive were blamed. The pilot survived.On September 29, 2020, a US Marine Corps F-35B was lost over Imperial County, California after colliding with a KC-130 tanker during midflight refueling. The tanker crew managed to bring their aircraft down for a hard landing. The F-35 pilot ejected successfully.On November 17, 2021, a British Royal Air Force F-35B plunged into the Mediterranean Sea after its pilot ejected during routine operations. That crash was ultimately blamed on a protective cover getting wedged into the plane’s engine intake.On January 4, 2022, a South Korean Air Force F-35A suffering from issues with its onboard avionics carried out an emergency belly landing. Investigators blamed a bird striking the warplane’s landing gear mid-flight. The pilot emerged unharmed.On January 24, 2022, a US Navy F-35C plunged into the South China Sea after making a hard landing on the USS Carl Vinson super carrier. The pilot and six sailors on the deck of the aircraft carrier were injured. A Navy investigation attributed the incident to pilot error.On October 19, 2022, another F-35, this one from the US Air Force, crashed at Hill Air Force Base in Utah during a training mission. The pilot ejected safely. It was later determined that turbulent air somehow confused the jet’s onboard avionics to the point where the aircraft became uncontrollable.On December 1, 2022, a Marine Corps F-35B collapsed on a military base in Japan after suffering a landing gear failure during training. No one was injured.Finally, on December 15, 2022, a US Navy F-35B crashed while attempting to perform a vertical landing at Naval Air Station Joint Reserve Base Fort Worth in Texas during testing of the jet’s systems. A “harmonic resonance” issue related to the jet’s Pratt & Whitney F135 engine was blamed, with the Pentagon halting further F-35 deliveries by Lockheed until an investigation was concluded.What’s Wrong With the F-35?Nearly 17 years after the F-35’s first flight, and eight years after its adoption into service, the F-35 continues to maintain a troublingly long list of technical bugs affecting both hardware and software. The aircraft, which has an astronomical total estimated purchase and sustainment price tag of over $1.7 trillion, and a per-plane cost of $70-$90 million, has faced years of harsh criticism from US officials, including former President Donald Trump at one point, who said the jet’s costs had spiraled “out of control.”At its heart, the F-35 is the product of an idea that metastasized in the Pentagon after the end of the Cold War, envisioning an all-in-one fighter platform which could be used by every branch of the military, equipped with vertical take-off and landing capability, and carry out a broad array of missions using a variety of onboard weapons. The do-it-all jet was supposed to replace nearly all of America’s fourth-gen fighter, strike, and ground attack aircraft, including the F-16 Falcon, the F/A-18 Hornet and Super Hornet, the AV-8B Harrier II, and others.The jet features just a single onboard engine – the aforementioned Pratt & Whitney F135, with engine-related troubles not only regularly referred to by watchdogs as a “leading driver” of the F-35’s problems remaining “mission capable,” but also making its operation over enemy territory or over the sea risky, since if something goes wrong, the plane doesn’t have a backup engine to limp home with.Throughout its production cycle, the F-35 Lightning II has suffered a dizzying and seemingly endless list of technical problems, from neck-snapping ejection seats to problems, ironically, while operating in stormy weather.In its 2023 report, the congressional Government Accountability Office revealed that the F-35 program “continues to experience schedule delays, cost growth, and late deliveries,” with procurement costs jumping by $13.4 billion since 2019, and modernization behind schedule and over budget.“As of January 2023, of the 821 open deficiencies, the program office characterized five of these as category 1 [i.e. critical issues which could jeopardize flight safety and security], and 816 as category 2, [i.e. those which could impede or constrain mission success].”In all, between December 2006 and 2023, the GAO has reported a whopping 277 category 1 and 2,467 category 2 deficiencies with the aircraft, among them serious issues like cabin over-pressurization, problems with the jets’ night vision systems, software bugs, radar issues, corrosion, ejection seats which could snap pilots’ necks, etc.Is a Culture of Largess to Blame?Sunday’s accident in South Carolina is the latest piece of F-35-related bad news for Lockheed Martin. In June, it was reported that the Pentagon had halted the delivery of any additional upgraded F-35s until major issues related to new Technology Refresh 3 (TR-3) hardware and weapons-related software were resolved. DoD F-35 program director Mike Schmidt told Congress in March that the risk assessment related to the TR-3 hardware upgrade wouldn’t be finished until April 2024.Despite the delays and array of technical problems, the weapons giant has continued to rack up generous contracts related to F-35 procurement and production. For example, in July, the US Navy ordered a $490 million package of equipment from Lockheed “to procure various material mod kits, special test/tooling equipment, as well as…product engineering” for already delivered, but defective planes. In August, Lockheed received another $606 million “fixed-price incentive (firm-target) undefinitized” contract “for long lead time materials, parts, components, and efforts to support of maintaining on-time production and delivery of 173 Lot 19 F-35 Joint Strike Fighter aircraft for Foreign Military Sales (FMS) customers and non-US Department of Defense (DOD) participants.”The terms of the contracts seem to be the culprit behind the F-35’s soaring costs (and Lockheed’s soaring profits, despite delivery of defective products), with so-called “cost-plus” and “undefinitized” contracts effectively making any overruns the buyer’s problem – i.e. that of US taxpayers, and of citizens of any country unfortunate enough to pen contracts for the planes from Lockheed.What About America’s Competitors?The worst part about the F-35’s troublesome history seems to be that the F-35 has already become ""obsolete"" in the sense that many of the US and NATO’s competitors have obtained the ability to defeat them, with Russia and China gaining capabilities to track and target the jets going back to the mid-to-late 2010s. In April, Iran announced that its engineers had created advanced radar technologies to not only detect F-35s, but identify the radar signature of individual F-35 planes, enabling the Islamic Republic to plan defensive operations accordingly.",WORLD,AMERICAS,Picture description not found,Author details not found,Author details not found,60,1305,<FreqDist with 18 samples and 775 outcomes>
Toxic explosion in Nebraska shows US unable to take issues affecting public security seriously: experts,Xu Yelu,2023-09-15,"Barely two months after an explosion in Louisiana, a train carrying toxic perchloric acid has exploded in a Nebraska rail yard on Thursday, prompting evacuation orders to be issued, as huge plumes are seen engulfing the city. Experts said the incident shows the US has been unable to take seriously and overcome major issues affecting public safety and the environment and ecology in the country.The incident happened on Union Pacific Railroad tracks in the city of North Platte. North Platte Volunteer Fire Department announced that they would order those living in the area to evacuate due to the toxic smoke from the railroad, according to media reports.In a post on social media platforms, it said that ""Emergency evacuation for the area between splinter and front North of railroad track due fire at the railroad involving heavy toxic smoke.""In a statement to DailyMail.com, Union Pacific Railroad said that an explosion occurred inside a container which resulted in several railcars catching fire. The railcar did not derail, the company said, and had been in the yard for several hours.Union Pacific said that one of the containers contained a hazardous chemical called perchloric acid, according to Daily Mail.Perchloric is a hazardous material used in food, drugs and biocidal products, as well as explosives, according to the report.Two months ago, a fire at a Louisiana chemical plant triggered explosions that shook homes several miles away and sent flames and smoke billowing into the air in mid-July, prompting emergency officials to urge a few hundred nearby residents to shelter indoors for several hours and to turn off their air conditioners, the Associated Press reported.Antiquated infrastructure and the outdated transportation were one factor. Another was a flawed system of governance in the US transport industry, experts noted. There is no doubt that the US has serious loopholes in the transportation management of hazardous substances, and the relevant error correction mechanism is in fact not effective, which means that this kind of thing will occur in the future, Li Haidong, a professor at the China Foreign Affairs University, told the Global Times on Friday.This shows that the US has been unable to take seriously and overcome serious and major issues affecting public safety and the environment and ecology in the country, Li said. ""It must be said that this is a great irony to the self-proclaimed internal governance of the most advanced country in the world.""Analysts said that the frequent occurrence of similar incidents shows that the error correction mechanism in the US has failed. Apart from this, racism and the proliferation of guns are also clear examples of the failure of error correction mechanisms, experts noted.",WORLD,AMERICAS,"A resident of East Palestine in the state of Ohio, US, angrily points during a town hall meeting held by the US

Greek scholar believes in ‘endless possibilities and vast land’ between China-Greece exchanges,Xu Liuliu,2023-09-14,"Chongqing, Sichuan, Shandong… Stelios Virvidakis expectantly plans his next China tour before a visit by the Global Times at his office in Athens, Greece. The University of Athens professor has grown far busier recently since he and four other Greek scholars launched the Center of Chinese and Greek Ancient Civilizations in February. Over the summer, the center has received two scholars from China who have given lectures on the history of China, and other visiting guests from places like Israel, who offered their views on Chinese medicine and its history, and a lecturer from France with insights in Chinese mathematics and how scholars in ancient China studied the living science.""Students found them to be very interesting and greatly appreciated the lectures,"" Virvidakis told the Global Times. ""Greece and China share so many similarities. So in my opinion, the horizon for our cooperation and exchanges is vast. There are endless possibilities which have not been explored.""Mutual learning Chinese President Xi Jinping replied to a letter from Virvidakis and four other Greek scholars earlier in 2023, extending congratulations over the founding of the Center of Chinese and Greek Ancient Civilizations.Hailing the long history of the Chinese civilization and profound influence of the ancient Greek civilization, Xi said in the letter that more than 2,000 years ago, the two civilizations shone brightly on the two ends of the Eurasian continent, jointly making a fundamental contribution to the evolution of human civilization.Greece's golden era produced many of its great philosophers and literary giants. The era coincided with a period in China in which ""a hundred schools of thought contended with each other"" and flourished together.As early as the 4th century BC, China was known to the Greeks by a beautiful name: Sērikḗ. In the 16th century, Euclid's Elements was introduced into China, paving the way for scientific exchanges between China and the West. The story of Prometheus narrated by Aeschylus was an inspiration to many Chinese revolutionaries. The Republic by Plato and Politics by Aristotle are also among the Greek classics known to have long made a name for themselves in China.In the eyes of Virvidakis, Chinese civilization has always been a culture that attracts people though the language is difficult. However, Chinese art, Chinese painting, Chinese poetry, especially love poems, even detective stories about China, are incredibly fascinating. Chinese director Zhang Yimou, and movies like Farewell My Concubine and Raise the Red Lantern starring Gong Li, are also very popular. Greek archaeologists who are interested in Chinese archeology want to know how China explores the past.In other art forms, the mythology and theater, ""we have tragedy, which is our own tradition. You have Chinese opera with music."" Actors and artists always want to study similarities and look at the differences, which is also the commitment of the center to promoting exchanges and mutual learning between the two civilizations and promoting the development of civilizations in various countries. China also has this appeal because people in the West think ""it's very different, it's exotic, something strange, but then they realize that it's beautiful for them."" So ""they find a lot of aspects that they have not thought about before in order to understand.""

Tiantan, a UNESCO World Heritage Site built in 1420, in Beijing Photo: VCGPhilosophy, a way of life There is a feeling among some people in the West that the Chinese system is different in some ways, said the professor. For instance,the European and American systems place great emphasis on individual rights, but China takes a more holistic approach in which ""harmony, social harmony is more important in sovereign.""""We are not exactly the same and there are also differences. But I don't believe in the so-called clash of civilizations theory that the clash is very deep and we can't live together with our differences,"" he told the Global Times. ""In fact we can live together and have peaceful exchanges. As I said, I don't think there is any danger of Greece threatening China or China occupying Greece.""In February, Virvidakis held a lecture at the center's launching ceremony, titled Philosophy is a Way of Life. Philosophy is not just theory, he said, noting that in ancient Greece and China it didn't mean just making theories about the universe, nature, god, or much of the unknown world. ""It told you how to 'organize' your life to feel happy and achieve harmony with others."" Western philosophy cannot be understood just by itself as there are also Chinese and Indian schools of philosophy among others. ""It is easier to see some similarities in ideas between Confucius and Socrates or Confucius and Aristotle,"" said Virvidakis, explaining why he is so fond of Chinese philosophy, especially Confucius thought. A simple question about what is a good life has a variety of answers in different philosophical theories.  But studying philosophy is practical and a way of life. Modern people don't just derive happiness from materialism. They need art and other emotionally stirring elements in life. In different parts and different cultures of the world,people can share similarities in emotion and sentiment.Virvidakis said that one of the most important reasons for his involving in such studies and exchanges was because ""I'm interested and I want to learn more. I'm a student too. When you are a teacher in your whole life, you're going to be a student.""",ARTS,CULTURE & LEISURE,The University of Athens Photo: VCG,"Reporter, Beijing","Global Times senior reporter, mainly covers the reporting of movies, TV, music and culture news.",43,880,<FreqDist with 16 samples and 473 outcomes>

 The first Saudi ambassador to Palestine Naif bin Bandar Al-Sudairi arrived in the West Bank on Tuesday, the official Palestinian news agency WAFA reported.Leading an official delegation, Al-Sudairi, the non-resident ambassador to Palestine and non-resident consul general in Jerusalem, presented his credentials to Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas at the presidency headquarters in Ramallah, it said.Al-Sudairi's arrival comes amid Israel's efforts to normalize relations with Saudi Arabia.During their meeting, Abbas welcomed Al-Sudairi and said his visit to Palestine and his appointment as Saudi ambassador to the State of Palestine would contribute to ""strengthening the strong fraternal relations that bind the two countries and the two brotherly peoples.""The Saudi ambassador said he hoped that his visit would be ""a successful beginning for strengthening relations in all fields,"" stressing his country's firm and supportive positions for the Palestinian people and their just cause.Earlier in the day, Al-Sudairi told reporters in a statement that ""the Arab Peace Initiative is the basic point in any upcoming agreement,"" after being asked about the fate of the initiative in the event of reaching a normalization deal between Saudi Arabia and Israel.The Arab Peace Initiative was launched in 2002 after it was drafted by Saudi Arabia and adopted by the Arab League.The initiative calls for an end to the conflict between Israel and Palestine and the normalization of relations between Israel and Arab states, in exchange for an Israeli withdrawal from the areas it gained since 1967 and proper settlement to the issue of Palestinian refugees.The Palestinians demanded the establishment of an independent state alongside Israel in all of the Palestinian territories occupied by Israel in 1967, including the entire West Bank and the Gaza Strip, with East Jerusalem as its capital.The Saudi ambassador also confirmed that his country intends to open a consulate in East Jerusalem soon.",PHOTO,WORLD,"Saudi ambassador to Palestine Naif bin Bandar Al-Sudairi (Front) arrives at the Palestinian foreign ministry headquarters in the West Bank city of Ramallah, on Sept. 26, 2023.(Photo: Xinhua)",Author details not found,Author details not found,12,313,<FreqDist with 15 samples and 181 outcomes>
China releases a white paper on its proposals and actions on building a global community of shared future,GT staff reporters,2023-09-26," The Chinese government released a white paper on Tuesday to introduce the theoretical base, practice and development of a global community of shared future, as by presenting China's vision of the course of human development, it counters the hegemonic thinking of certain countries that seek supremacy. The white paper, titled ""A Global Community of Shared Future: China's Proposals and Actions,"" introduced the background for China to raise the concept of a global community of shared future as the world is undergoing changes on a scale unseen in a century with various problems posing unprecedented challenges for human society. The zero-sum game is doomed to fail, the white paper said. But certain countries still cling to this mindset, blindly pursuing absolute security and monopolistic advantages, which will do nothing for their development in the long run but create a major threat to the world. It is increasingly obvious that the obsession with superior strength, and the zero-sum mentality are in conflict with the needs of our times, the white paper said, pointing out that the new era calls for new ideas. To build a global community of shared future is to pursue openness, inclusiveness, mutual benefit, equity and justice, the white paper said. The goal is not to replace one system or civilization with another. Instead, it is about countries with different social systems, ideologies, histories, shared rights, and shared responsibilities in global affairs. The vision of a global community of shared future stands on the right side of history and on the side of human progress. It introduces a new approach for international relations, provides new ideas for global governance, opens up new prospects for international exchanges and draws a new blueprint for a better world, according to the white paper. Such important vision transcends outdated mindsets such as zero-sum game, power politics, and Cold War confrontations. It has become the overall goal of China's major-country diplomacy in the new era, and a great banner that leads the trend of the times and the direction of human progress. The concept of a global community of shared future has deep roots in China's profound cultural heritage and its unique experience of modernization. It carries forward the diplomatic traditions of China and draws on the outstanding achievements of all other civilizations, the white paper said. It also manifests China's time-honored historical traditions, distinct characteristics of the times, and a wealth of humanistic values.  The white paper also pointed out the direction and plan to build a global community of shared future including pressing ahead with a new type of economic globalization in which countries need to pursue a policy of openness and explicitly oppose protectionism, the erection of fences and barriers, unilateral sanctions, and maximum-pressure tactics, so as to connect economies and jointly build an open world economy. Some countries are seeking to decouple from China, enclosing themselves in ""small yards, high fences,"" which will ultimately only backfire, the white paper said. Also, some people overstate the need to ""reduce dependence"" and ""de-risk,"" which is essentially creating new risks. The direction and the plan also include following a peaceful development plan, fostering a new type of international relations, practicing true multilateralism and promoting the common values of humanity. Over the past decade, China has contributed its strength to building a global community of shared future with firm conviction and solid actions. For instance, by July 2023, more than three-quarters of countries in the world and over 30 international organizations had signed agreements on Belt and Road cooperation with China. The BRI originated in China but the opportunities and achievements it creates belong to the whole world. It's an initiative for economic cooperation, not for geopolitical or military alliances, and it's open and inclusive process that neither targets nor excludes any party, the white paper said. Among those BRI projects, for example, the China-Laos Railway began operation on December 3, 2021, with 167 tunnels and 301 bridges built in 11 years along its total length of 1,035 kilometers. The railway construction created more than 110,000 local jobs, and helped build about 2,000 kilometers of roads and canals for villages along the railway, benefiting local people. Besides the BRI, the Global Development Initiative, the Global Security Initiative and Global Civilization Initiative have evolved into a crucial cornerstone for building a global community of shared future, offering China's solutions to major challenges pertaining to peace and development for humanity. Facing constant flare-ups of hotspot issues, China has been committed to fulfilling its role as a responsible major country, pushing for the resolution of international and regional flashpoints, such as the Korean Peninsula, Palestine, the Iranian nuclear issue, Syria and Afghanistan, the white paper said. On the Ukraine issue, China has actively promoted talks for peace, put forth four points, four things that the international community should do together and three observations, and released China's position on the political settlement of the Ukraine crisis and has dispatched the special representative of the Chinese government on Eurasian affairs to engage in extensive interactions and exchanges with stakeholders on the political settlement of the Ukraine crisis. Also, through the mediation of China, Saudi Arabia and Iran achieve historic reconciliation earlier this year, setting a fine example for countries in the region to resolve disputes and differences and achieve good neighborly relations through dialogue and consultation, and catalyzing a wave of reconciliation in the Middle East. China has also proposed a range of regional and bilateral initiatives on building communities of shared future and working with stakeholders to build consensus and expand cooperation, there by playing a constructive role in promoting regional peace and development. It also boosts international cooperation in fields including fighting the COVID-19 pandemic, addressing disorder in cyberspace governance and dealing with the global climate challenge. Over the past decade, the vision of a global community of shared future has gained broader support. More countries and people have come to the understanding that this vision serves the common interests of humanity, represents popular calls for peace, justice and progress, and can create the greatest synergy among all nations for building a better world, the white paper said.",CHINA,POLITICS,Photo: Li Xuanmin/GT,Author details not found,Author details not found,33,1000,<FreqDist with 17 samples and 603 outcomes>

F-35: Closer Look at Colossally Costly Jet That Just Can’t Seem to Stay Airborne,Sputnik,2023-09-21,"A US Marine Corps F-35B went down over South Carolina on Sunday after its pilot ejected mid-flight for reasons unknown. Why do F-35s seem so crash-prone? What’s wrong with them? And what role does the waste and fraud in the US military-industrial complex play in creating such a Frankenstein’s monster of an aircraft? Sputnik explores.Debris from the F-35B that went missing over South Carolina on September 17 was found in Williamsburg County, South Carolina, about two hours northeast of Joint Base Charleston on Monday following more than a day of frantic searching by the military. An as yet unspecified “mishap” was blamed for the accident. The pilot escaped unscathed.“The mishap is currently under investigation, and we are unable to provide additional details to preserve the integrity of the investigative process,” the Marine Corps said in a statement Monday. The Marines ordered a two-day global pause in all aerial operations, with the errant F-35B becoming the third major aviation-related accident suffered by the military branch in less than two months.Air units will be discussing “fundamentals of safe flight operations, ground safety, maintenance and flight procedures, and maintaining combat readiness,” the Marine Corps said.How Many F-35s Have Been Lost?Since it started being introduced into service with the Marines (2015), the US Air Force (2016), and the US Navy (2019) and began to be exported to foreign clients (starting with Israel in 2018), the F-35 has gained an unenviable reputation of being a costly, buggy, and crash-prone jet, with the F-35B that went down over South Carolina last week being at least the 11th Lightning II lost since 2018.On September 28, 2018, a US Marine Corps F-35B crashed during a flight near Marine Corps Air Station Beaufort in South Carolina, with a faulty fuel tube blamed for the incident. The pilot emerged unscathed.On April 9, 2019, a Japanese Self- Defense Force F-35A went down off Honshu, Japan. The pilot was killed after losing his bearings and suffering “special disorientation” mid-flight over the ocean.On May 19, 2020, a US Air Force F-35A from the 58th Fighter Squadron crashed while performing a landing at Eglin Air Force Base in western Florida. Pilot error (trying to land at excessive speed) and a mechanical defect related to a flight control glitch that left the plane’s tail unresponsive were blamed. The pilot survived.On September 29, 2020, a US Marine Corps F-35B was lost over Imperial County, California after colliding with a KC-130 tanker during midflight refueling. The tanker crew managed to bring their aircraft down for a hard landing. The F-35 pilot ejected successfully.On November 17, 2021, a British Royal Air Force F-35B plunged into the Mediterranean Sea after its pilot ejected during routine operations. That crash was ultimately blamed on a protective cover getting wedged into the plane’s engine intake.On January 4, 2022, a South Korean Air Force F-35A suffering from issues with its onboard avionics carried out an emergency belly landing. Investigators blamed a bird striking the warplane’s landing gear mid-flight. The pilot emerged unharmed.On January 24, 2022, a US Navy F-35C plunged into the South China Sea after making a hard landing on the USS Carl Vinson super carrier. The pilot and six sailors on the deck of the aircraft carrier were injured. A Navy investigation attributed the incident to pilot error.On October 19, 2022, another F-35, this one from the US Air Force, crashed at Hill Air Force Base in Utah during a training mission. The pilot ejected safely. It was later determined that turbulent air somehow confused the jet’s onboard avionics to the point where the aircraft became uncontrollable.On December 1, 2022, a Marine Corps F-35B collapsed on a military base in Japan after suffering a landing gear failure during training. No one was injured.Finally, on December 15, 2022, a US Navy F-35B crashed while attempting to perform a vertical landing at Naval Air Station Joint Reserve Base Fort Worth in Texas during testing of the jet’s systems. A “harmonic resonance” issue related to the jet’s Pratt & Whitney F135 engine was blamed, with the Pentagon halting further F-35 deliveries by Lockheed until an investigation was concluded.What’s Wrong With the F-35?Nearly 17 years after the F-35’s first flight, and eight years after its adoption into service, the F-35 continues to maintain a troublingly long list of technical bugs affecting both hardware and software. The aircraft, which has an astronomical total estimated purchase and sustainment price tag of over $1.7 trillion, and a per-plane cost of $70-$90 million, has faced years of harsh criticism from US officials, including former President Donald Trump at one point, who said the jet’s costs had spiraled “out of control.”At its heart, the F-35 is the product of an idea that metastasized in the Pentagon after the end of the Cold War, envisioning an all-in-one fighter platform which could be used by every branch of the military, equipped with vertical take-off and landing capability, and carry out a broad array of missions using a variety of onboard weapons. The do-it-all jet was supposed to replace nearly all of America’s fourth-gen fighter, strike, and ground attack aircraft, including the F-16 Falcon, the F/A-18 Hornet and Super Hornet, the AV-8B Harrier II, and others.The jet features just a single onboard engine – the aforementioned Pratt & Whitney F135, with engine-related troubles not only regularly referred to by watchdogs as a “leading driver” of the F-35’s problems remaining “mission capable,” but also making its operation over enemy territory or over the sea risky, since if something goes wrong, the plane doesn’t have a backup engine to limp home with.Throughout its production cycle, the F-35 Lightning II has suffered a dizzying and seemingly endless list of technical problems, from neck-snapping ejection seats to problems, ironically, while operating in stormy weather.In its 2023 report, the congressional Government Accountability Office revealed that the F-35 program “continues to experience schedule delays, cost growth, and late deliveries,” with procurement costs jumping by $13.4 billion since 2019, and modernization behind schedule and over budget.“As of January 2023, of the 821 open deficiencies, the program office characterized five of these as category 1 [i.e. critical issues which could jeopardize flight safety and security], and 816 as category 2, [i.e. those which could impede or constrain mission success].”In all, between December 2006 and 2023, the GAO has reported a whopping 277 category 1 and 2,467 category 2 deficiencies with the aircraft, among them serious issues like cabin over-pressurization, problems with the jets’ night vision systems, software bugs, radar issues, corrosion, ejection seats which could snap pilots’ necks, etc.Is a Culture of Largess to Blame?Sunday’s accident in South Carolina is the latest piece of F-35-related bad news for Lockheed Martin. In June, it was reported that the Pentagon had halted the delivery of any additional upgraded F-35s until major issues related to new Technology Refresh 3 (TR-3) hardware and weapons-related software were resolved. DoD F-35 program director Mike Schmidt told Congress in March that the risk assessment related to the TR-3 hardware upgrade wouldn’t be finished until April 2024.Despite the delays and array of technical problems, the weapons giant has continued to rack up generous contracts related to F-35 procurement and production. For example, in July, the US Navy ordered a $490 million package of equipment from Lockheed “to procure various material mod kits, special test/tooling equipment, as well as…product engineering” for already delivered, but defective planes. In August, Lockheed received another $606 million “fixed-price incentive (firm-target) undefinitized” contract “for long lead time materials, parts, components, and efforts to support of maintaining on-time production and delivery of 173 Lot 19 F-35 Joint Strike Fighter aircraft for Foreign Military Sales (FMS) customers and non-US Department of Defense (DOD) participants.”The terms of the contracts seem to be the culprit behind the F-35’s soaring costs (and Lockheed’s soaring profits, despite delivery of defective products), with so-called “cost-plus” and “undefinitized” contracts effectively making any overruns the buyer’s problem – i.e. that of US taxpayers, and of citizens of any country unfortunate enough to pen contracts for the planes from Lockheed.What About America’s Competitors?The worst part about the F-35’s troublesome history seems to be that the F-35 has already become ""obsolete"" in the sense that many of the US and NATO’s competitors have obtained the ability to defeat them, with Russia and China gaining capabilities to track and target the jets going back to the mid-to-late 2010s. In April, Iran announced that its engineers had created advanced radar technologies to not only detect F-35s, but identify the radar signature of individual F-35 planes, enabling the Islamic Republic to plan defensive operations accordingly.",WORLD,AMERICAS,Picture description not found,Author details not found,Author details not found,60,1305,<FreqDist with 18 samples and 775 outcomes>
Toxic explosion in Nebraska shows US unable to take issues affecting public security seriously: experts,Xu Yelu,2023-09-15,"Barely two months after an explosion in Louisiana, a train carrying toxic perchloric acid has exploded in a Nebraska rail yard on Thursday, prompting evacuation orders to be issued, as huge plumes are seen engulfing the city. Experts said the incident shows the US has been unable to take seriously and overcome major issues affecting public safety and the environment and ecology in the country.The incident happened on Union Pacific Railroad tracks in the city of North Platte. North Platte Volunteer Fire Department announced that they would order those living in the area to evacuate due to the toxic smoke from the railroad, according to media reports.In a post on social media platforms, it said that ""Emergency evacuation for the area between splinter and front North of railroad track due fire at the railroad involving heavy toxic smoke.""In a statement to DailyMail.com, Union Pacific Railroad said that an explosion occurred inside a container which resulted in several railcars catching fire. The railcar did not derail, the company said, and had been in the yard for several hours.Union Pacific said that one of the containers contained a hazardous chemical called perchloric acid, according to Daily Mail.Perchloric is a hazardous material used in food, drugs and biocidal products, as well as explosives, according to the report.Two months ago, a fire at a Louisiana chemical plant triggered explosions that shook homes several miles away and sent flames and smoke billowing into the air in mid-July, prompting emergency officials to urge a few hundred nearby residents to shelter indoors for several hours and to turn off their air conditioners, the Associated Press reported.Antiquated infrastructure and the outdated transportation were one factor. Another was a flawed system of governance in the US transport industry, experts noted. There is no doubt that the US has serious loopholes in the transportation management of hazardous substances, and the relevant error correction mechanism is in fact not effective, which means that this kind of thing will occur in the future, Li Haidong, a professor at the China Foreign Affairs University, told the Global Times on Friday.This shows that the US has been unable to take seriously and overcome serious and major issues affecting public safety and the environment and ecology in the country, Li said. ""It must be said that this is a great irony to the self-proclaimed internal governance of the most advanced country in the world.""Analysts said that the frequent occurrence of similar incidents shows that the error correction mechanism in the US has failed. Apart from this, racism and the proliferation of guns are also clear examples of the failure of error correction mechanisms, experts noted.",WORLD,AMERICAS,"A resident of East Palestine in the state of Ohio, US, angrily points during a town hall meeting held by the US

Greek scholar believes in ‘endless possibilities and vast land’ between China-Greece exchanges,Xu Liuliu,2023-09-14,"Chongqing, Sichuan, Shandong… Stelios Virvidakis expectantly plans his next China tour before a visit by the Global Times at his office in Athens, Greece. The University of Athens professor has grown far busier recently since he and four other Greek scholars launched the Center of Chinese and Greek Ancient Civilizations in February. Over the summer, the center has received two scholars from China who have given lectures on the history of China, and other visiting guests from places like Israel, who offered their views on Chinese medicine and its history, and a lecturer from France with insights in Chinese mathematics and how scholars in ancient China studied the living science.""Students found them to be very interesting and greatly appreciated the lectures,"" Virvidakis told the Global Times. ""Greece and China share so many similarities. So in my opinion, the horizon for our cooperation and exchanges is vast. There are endless possibilities which have not been explored.""Mutual learning Chinese President Xi Jinping replied to a letter from Virvidakis and four other Greek scholars earlier in 2023, extending congratulations over the founding of the Center of Chinese and Greek Ancient Civilizations.Hailing the long history of the Chinese civilization and profound influence of the ancient Greek civilization, Xi said in the letter that more than 2,000 years ago, the two civilizations shone brightly on the two ends of the Eurasian continent, jointly making a fundamental contribution to the evolution of human civilization.Greece's golden era produced many of its great philosophers and literary giants. The era coincided with a period in China in which ""a hundred schools of thought contended with each other"" and flourished together.As early as the 4th century BC, China was known to the Greeks by a beautiful name: Sērikḗ. In the 16th century, Euclid's Elements was introduced into China, paving the way for scientific exchanges between China and the West. The story of Prometheus narrated by Aeschylus was an inspiration to many Chinese revolutionaries. The Republic by Plato and Politics by Aristotle are also among the Greek classics known to have long made a name for themselves in China.In the eyes of Virvidakis, Chinese civilization has always been a culture that attracts people though the language is difficult. However, Chinese art, Chinese painting, Chinese poetry, especially love poems, even detective stories about China, are incredibly fascinating. Chinese director Zhang Yimou, and movies like Farewell My Concubine and Raise the Red Lantern starring Gong Li, are also very popular. Greek archaeologists who are interested in Chinese archeology want to know how China explores the past.In other art forms, the mythology and theater, ""we have tragedy, which is our own tradition. You have Chinese opera with music."" Actors and artists always want to study similarities and look at the differences, which is also the commitment of the center to promoting exchanges and mutual learning between the two civilizations and promoting the development of civilizations in various countries. China also has this appeal because people in the West think ""it's very different, it's exotic, something strange, but then they realize that it's beautiful for them."" So ""they find a lot of aspects that they have not thought about before in order to understand.""

Tiantan, a UNESCO World Heritage Site built in 1420, in Beijing Photo: VCGPhilosophy, a way of life There is a feeling among some people in the West that the Chinese system is different in some ways, said the professor. For instance,the European and American systems place great emphasis on individual rights, but China takes a more holistic approach in which ""harmony, social harmony is more important in sovereign.""""We are not exactly the same and there are also differences. But I don't believe in the so-called clash of civilizations theory that the clash is very deep and we can't live together with our differences,"" he told the Global Times. ""In fact we can live together and have peaceful exchanges. As I said, I don't think there is any danger of Greece threatening China or China occupying Greece.""In February, Virvidakis held a lecture at the center's launching ceremony, titled Philosophy is a Way of Life. Philosophy is not just theory, he said, noting that in ancient Greece and China it didn't mean just making theories about the universe, nature, god, or much of the unknown world. ""It told you how to 'organize' your life to feel happy and achieve harmony with others."" Western philosophy cannot be understood just by itself as there are also Chinese and Indian schools of philosophy among others. ""It is easier to see some similarities in ideas between Confucius and Socrates or Confucius and Aristotle,"" said Virvidakis, explaining why he is so fond of Chinese philosophy, especially Confucius thought. A simple question about what is a good life has a variety of answers in different philosophical theories.  But studying philosophy is practical and a way of life. Modern people don't just derive happiness from materialism. They need art and other emotionally stirring elements in life. In different parts and different cultures of the world,people can share similarities in emotion and sentiment.Virvidakis said that one of the most important reasons for his involving in such studies and exchanges was because ""I'm interested and I want to learn more. I'm a student too. When you are a teacher in your whole life, you're going to be a student.""",ARTS,CULTURE & LEISURE,The University of Athens Photo: VCG,"Reporter, Beijing","Global Times senior reporter, mainly covers the reporting of movies, TV, music and culture news.",43,880,<FreqDist with 16 samples and 473 outcomes>

 The first Saudi ambassador to Palestine Naif bin Bandar Al-Sudairi arrived in the West Bank on Tuesday, the official Palestinian news agency WAFA reported.Leading an official delegation, Al-Sudairi, the non-resident ambassador to Palestine and non-resident consul general in Jerusalem, presented his credentials to Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas at the presidency headquarters in Ramallah, it said.Al-Sudairi's arrival comes amid Israel's efforts to normalize relations with Saudi Arabia.During their meeting, Abbas welcomed Al-Sudairi and said his visit to Palestine and his appointment as Saudi ambassador to the State of Palestine would contribute to ""strengthening the strong fraternal relations that bind the two countries and the two brotherly peoples.""The Saudi ambassador said he hoped that his visit would be ""a successful beginning for strengthening relations in all fields,"" stressing his country's firm and supportive positions for the Palestinian people and their just cause.Earlier in the day, Al-Sudairi told reporters in a statement that ""the Arab Peace Initiative is the basic point in any upcoming agreement,"" after being asked about the fate of the initiative in the event of reaching a normalization deal between Saudi Arabia and Israel.The Arab Peace Initiative was launched in 2002 after it was drafted by Saudi Arabia and adopted by the Arab League.The initiative calls for an end to the conflict between Israel and Palestine and the normalization of relations between Israel and Arab states, in exchange for an Israeli withdrawal from the areas it gained since 1967 and proper settlement to the issue of Palestinian refugees.The Palestinians demanded the establishment of an independent state alongside Israel in all of the Palestinian territories occupied by Israel in 1967, including the entire West Bank and the Gaza Strip, with East Jerusalem as its capital.The Saudi ambassador also confirmed that his country intends to open a consulate in East Jerusalem soon.",PHOTO,WORLD,"Saudi ambassador to Palestine Naif bin Bandar Al-Sudairi (Front) arrives at the Palestinian foreign ministry headquarters in the West Bank city of Ramallah, on Sept. 26, 2023.(Photo: Xinhua)",Author details not found,Author details not found,12,313,<FreqDist with 15 samples and 181 outcomes>
China releases a white paper on its proposals and actions on building a global community of shared future,GT staff reporters,2023-09-26," The Chinese government released a white paper on Tuesday to introduce the theoretical base, practice and development of a global community of shared future, as by presenting China's vision of the course of human development, it counters the hegemonic thinking of certain countries that seek supremacy. The white paper, titled ""A Global Community of Shared Future: China's Proposals and Actions,"" introduced the background for China to raise the concept of a global community of shared future as the world is undergoing changes on a scale unseen in a century with various problems posing unprecedented challenges for human society. The zero-sum game is doomed to fail, the white paper said. But certain countries still cling to this mindset, blindly pursuing absolute security and monopolistic advantages, which will do nothing for their development in the long run but create a major threat to the world. It is increasingly obvious that the obsession with superior strength, and the zero-sum mentality are in conflict with the needs of our times, the white paper said, pointing out that the new era calls for new ideas. To build a global community of shared future is to pursue openness, inclusiveness, mutual benefit, equity and justice, the white paper said. The goal is not to replace one system or civilization with another. Instead, it is about countries with different social systems, ideologies, histories, shared rights, and shared responsibilities in global affairs. The vision of a global community of shared future stands on the right side of history and on the side of human progress. It introduces a new approach for international relations, provides new ideas for global governance, opens up new prospects for international exchanges and draws a new blueprint for a better world, according to the white paper. Such important vision transcends outdated mindsets such as zero-sum game, power politics, and Cold War confrontations. It has become the overall goal of China's major-country diplomacy in the new era, and a great banner that leads the trend of the times and the direction of human progress. The concept of a global community of shared future has deep roots in China's profound cultural heritage and its unique experience of modernization. It carries forward the diplomatic traditions of China and draws on the outstanding achievements of all other civilizations, the white paper said. It also manifests China's time-honored historical traditions, distinct characteristics of the times, and a wealth of humanistic values.  The white paper also pointed out the direction and plan to build a global community of shared future including pressing ahead with a new type of economic globalization in which countries need to pursue a policy of openness and explicitly oppose protectionism, the erection of fences and barriers, unilateral sanctions, and maximum-pressure tactics, so as to connect economies and jointly build an open world economy. Some countries are seeking to decouple from China, enclosing themselves in ""small yards, high fences,"" which will ultimately only backfire, the white paper said. Also, some people overstate the need to ""reduce dependence"" and ""de-risk,"" which is essentially creating new risks. The direction and the plan also include following a peaceful development plan, fostering a new type of international relations, practicing true multilateralism and promoting the common values of humanity. Over the past decade, China has contributed its strength to building a global community of shared future with firm conviction and solid actions. For instance, by July 2023, more than three-quarters of countries in the world and over 30 international organizations had signed agreements on Belt and Road cooperation with China. The BRI originated in China but the opportunities and achievements it creates belong to the whole world. It's an initiative for economic cooperation, not for geopolitical or military alliances, and it's open and inclusive process that neither targets nor excludes any party, the white paper said. Among those BRI projects, for example, the China-Laos Railway began operation on December 3, 2021, with 167 tunnels and 301 bridges built in 11 years along its total length of 1,035 kilometers. The railway construction created more than 110,000 local jobs, and helped build about 2,000 kilometers of roads and canals for villages along the railway, benefiting local people. Besides the BRI, the Global Development Initiative, the Global Security Initiative and Global Civilization Initiative have evolved into a crucial cornerstone for building a global community of shared future, offering China's solutions to major challenges pertaining to peace and development for humanity. Facing constant flare-ups of hotspot issues, China has been committed to fulfilling its role as a responsible major country, pushing for the resolution of international and regional flashpoints, such as the Korean Peninsula, Palestine, the Iranian nuclear issue, Syria and Afghanistan, the white paper said. On the Ukraine issue, China has actively promoted talks for peace, put forth four points, four things that the international community should do together and three observations, and released China's position on the political settlement of the Ukraine crisis and has dispatched the special representative of the Chinese government on Eurasian affairs to engage in extensive interactions and exchanges with stakeholders on the political settlement of the Ukraine crisis. Also, through the mediation of China, Saudi Arabia and Iran achieve historic reconciliation earlier this year, setting a fine example for countries in the region to resolve disputes and differences and achieve good neighborly relations through dialogue and consultation, and catalyzing a wave of reconciliation in the Middle East. China has also proposed a range of regional and bilateral initiatives on building communities of shared future and working with stakeholders to build consensus and expand cooperation, there by playing a constructive role in promoting regional peace and development. It also boosts international cooperation in fields including fighting the COVID-19 pandemic, addressing disorder in cyberspace governance and dealing with the global climate challenge. Over the past decade, the vision of a global community of shared future has gained broader support. More countries and people have come to the understanding that this vision serves the common interests of humanity, represents popular calls for peace, justice and progress, and can create the greatest synergy among all nations for building a better world, the white paper said.",CHINA,POLITICS,Photo: Li Xuanmin/GT,Author details not found,Author details not found,33,1000,<FreqDist with 17 samples and 603 outcomes>

F-35: Closer Look at Colossally Costly Jet That Just Can’t Seem to Stay Airborne,Sputnik,2023-09-21,"A US Marine Corps F-35B went down over South Carolina on Sunday after its pilot ejected mid-flight for reasons unknown. Why do F-35s seem so crash-prone? What’s wrong with them? And what role does the waste and fraud in the US military-industrial complex play in creating such a Frankenstein’s monster of an aircraft? Sputnik explores.Debris from the F-35B that went missing over South Carolina on September 17 was found in Williamsburg County, South Carolina, about two hours northeast of Joint Base Charleston on Monday following more than a day of frantic searching by the military. An as yet unspecified “mishap” was blamed for the accident. The pilot escaped unscathed.“The mishap is currently under investigation, and we are unable to provide additional details to preserve the integrity of the investigative process,” the Marine Corps said in a statement Monday. The Marines ordered a two-day global pause in all aerial operations, with the errant F-35B becoming the third major aviation-related accident suffered by the military branch in less than two months.Air units will be discussing “fundamentals of safe flight operations, ground safety, maintenance and flight procedures, and maintaining combat readiness,” the Marine Corps said.How Many F-35s Have Been Lost?Since it started being introduced into service with the Marines (2015), the US Air Force (2016), and the US Navy (2019) and began to be exported to foreign clients (starting with Israel in 2018), the F-35 has gained an unenviable reputation of being a costly, buggy, and crash-prone jet, with the F-35B that went down over South Carolina last week being at least the 11th Lightning II lost since 2018.On September 28, 2018, a US Marine Corps F-35B crashed during a flight near Marine Corps Air Station Beaufort in South Carolina, with a faulty fuel tube blamed for the incident. The pilot emerged unscathed.On April 9, 2019, a Japanese Self- Defense Force F-35A went down off Honshu, Japan. The pilot was killed after losing his bearings and suffering “special disorientation” mid-flight over the ocean.On May 19, 2020, a US Air Force F-35A from the 58th Fighter Squadron crashed while performing a landing at Eglin Air Force Base in western Florida. Pilot error (trying to land at excessive speed) and a mechanical defect related to a flight control glitch that left the plane’s tail unresponsive were blamed. The pilot survived.On September 29, 2020, a US Marine Corps F-35B was lost over Imperial County, California after colliding with a KC-130 tanker during midflight refueling. The tanker crew managed to bring their aircraft down for a hard landing. The F-35 pilot ejected successfully.On November 17, 2021, a British Royal Air Force F-35B plunged into the Mediterranean Sea after its pilot ejected during routine operations. That crash was ultimately blamed on a protective cover getting wedged into the plane’s engine intake.On January 4, 2022, a South Korean Air Force F-35A suffering from issues with its onboard avionics carried out an emergency belly landing. Investigators blamed a bird striking the warplane’s landing gear mid-flight. The pilot emerged unharmed.On January 24, 2022, a US Navy F-35C plunged into the South China Sea after making a hard landing on the USS Carl Vinson super carrier. The pilot and six sailors on the deck of the aircraft carrier were injured. A Navy investigation attributed the incident to pilot error.On October 19, 2022, another F-35, this one from the US Air Force, crashed at Hill Air Force Base in Utah during a training mission. The pilot ejected safely. It was later determined that turbulent air somehow confused the jet’s onboard avionics to the point where the aircraft became uncontrollable.On December 1, 2022, a Marine Corps F-35B collapsed on a military base in Japan after suffering a landing gear failure during training. No one was injured.Finally, on December 15, 2022, a US Navy F-35B crashed while attempting to perform a vertical landing at Naval Air Station Joint Reserve Base Fort Worth in Texas during testing of the jet’s systems. A “harmonic resonance” issue related to the jet’s Pratt & Whitney F135 engine was blamed, with the Pentagon halting further F-35 deliveries by Lockheed until an investigation was concluded.What’s Wrong With the F-35?Nearly 17 years after the F-35’s first flight, and eight years after its adoption into service, the F-35 continues to maintain a troublingly long list of technical bugs affecting both hardware and software. The aircraft, which has an astronomical total estimated purchase and sustainment price tag of over $1.7 trillion, and a per-plane cost of $70-$90 million, has faced years of harsh criticism from US officials, including former President Donald Trump at one point, who said the jet’s costs had spiraled “out of control.”At its heart, the F-35 is the product of an idea that metastasized in the Pentagon after the end of the Cold War, envisioning an all-in-one fighter platform which could be used by every branch of the military, equipped with vertical take-off and landing capability, and carry out a broad array of missions using a variety of onboard weapons. The do-it-all jet was supposed to replace nearly all of America’s fourth-gen fighter, strike, and ground attack aircraft, including the F-16 Falcon, the F/A-18 Hornet and Super Hornet, the AV-8B Harrier II, and others.The jet features just a single onboard engine – the aforementioned Pratt & Whitney F135, with engine-related troubles not only regularly referred to by watchdogs as a “leading driver” of the F-35’s problems remaining “mission capable,” but also making its operation over enemy territory or over the sea risky, since if something goes wrong, the plane doesn’t have a backup engine to limp home with.Throughout its production cycle, the F-35 Lightning II has suffered a dizzying and seemingly endless list of technical problems, from neck-snapping ejection seats to problems, ironically, while operating in stormy weather.In its 2023 report, the congressional Government Accountability Office revealed that the F-35 program “continues to experience schedule delays, cost growth, and late deliveries,” with procurement costs jumping by $13.4 billion since 2019, and modernization behind schedule and over budget.“As of January 2023, of the 821 open deficiencies, the program office characterized five of these as category 1 [i.e. critical issues which could jeopardize flight safety and security], and 816 as category 2, [i.e. those which could impede or constrain mission success].”In all, between December 2006 and 2023, the GAO has reported a whopping 277 category 1 and 2,467 category 2 deficiencies with the aircraft, among them serious issues like cabin over-pressurization, problems with the jets’ night vision systems, software bugs, radar issues, corrosion, ejection seats which could snap pilots’ necks, etc.Is a Culture of Largess to Blame?Sunday’s accident in South Carolina is the latest piece of F-35-related bad news for Lockheed Martin. In June, it was reported that the Pentagon had halted the delivery of any additional upgraded F-35s until major issues related to new Technology Refresh 3 (TR-3) hardware and weapons-related software were resolved. DoD F-35 program director Mike Schmidt told Congress in March that the risk assessment related to the TR-3 hardware upgrade wouldn’t be finished until April 2024.Despite the delays and array of technical problems, the weapons giant has continued to rack up generous contracts related to F-35 procurement and production. For example, in July, the US Navy ordered a $490 million package of equipment from Lockheed “to procure various material mod kits, special test/tooling equipment, as well as…product engineering” for already delivered, but defective planes. In August, Lockheed received another $606 million “fixed-price incentive (firm-target) undefinitized” contract “for long lead time materials, parts, components, and efforts to support of maintaining on-time production and delivery of 173 Lot 19 F-35 Joint Strike Fighter aircraft for Foreign Military Sales (FMS) customers and non-US Department of Defense (DOD) participants.”The terms of the contracts seem to be the culprit behind the F-35’s soaring costs (and Lockheed’s soaring profits, despite delivery of defective products), with so-called “cost-plus” and “undefinitized” contracts effectively making any overruns the buyer’s problem – i.e. that of US taxpayers, and of citizens of any country unfortunate enough to pen contracts for the planes from Lockheed.What About America’s Competitors?The worst part about the F-35’s troublesome history seems to be that the F-35 has already become ""obsolete"" in the sense that many of the US and NATO’s competitors have obtained the ability to defeat them, with Russia and China gaining capabilities to track and target the jets going back to the mid-to-late 2010s. In April, Iran announced that its engineers had created advanced radar technologies to not only detect F-35s, but identify the radar signature of individual F-35 planes, enabling the Islamic Republic to plan defensive operations accordingly.",WORLD,AMERICAS,Picture description not found,Author details not found,Author details not found,60,1305,<FreqDist with 18 samples and 775 outcomes>
Toxic explosion in Nebraska shows US unable to take issues affecting public security seriously: experts,Xu Yelu,2023-09-15,"Barely two months after an explosion in Louisiana, a train carrying toxic perchloric acid has exploded in a Nebraska rail yard on Thursday, prompting evacuation orders to be issued, as huge plumes are seen engulfing the city. Experts said the incident shows the US has been unable to take seriously and overcome major issues affecting public safety and the environment and ecology in the country.The incident happened on Union Pacific Railroad tracks in the city of North Platte. North Platte Volunteer Fire Department announced that they would order those living in the area to evacuate due to the toxic smoke from the railroad, according to media reports.In a post on social media platforms, it said that ""Emergency evacuation for the area between splinter and front North of railroad track due fire at the railroad involving heavy toxic smoke.""In a statement to DailyMail.com, Union Pacific Railroad said that an explosion occurred inside a container which resulted in several railcars catching fire. The railcar did not derail, the company said, and had been in the yard for several hours.Union Pacific said that one of the containers contained a hazardous chemical called perchloric acid, according to Daily Mail.Perchloric is a hazardous material used in food, drugs and biocidal products, as well as explosives, according to the report.Two months ago, a fire at a Louisiana chemical plant triggered explosions that shook homes several miles away and sent flames and smoke billowing into the air in mid-July, prompting emergency officials to urge a few hundred nearby residents to shelter indoors for several hours and to turn off their air conditioners, the Associated Press reported.Antiquated infrastructure and the outdated transportation were one factor. Another was a flawed system of governance in the US transport industry, experts noted. There is no doubt that the US has serious loopholes in the transportation management of hazardous substances, and the relevant error correction mechanism is in fact not effective, which means that this kind of thing will occur in the future, Li Haidong, a professor at the China Foreign Affairs University, told the Global Times on Friday.This shows that the US has been unable to take seriously and overcome serious and major issues affecting public safety and the environment and ecology in the country, Li said. ""It must be said that this is a great irony to the self-proclaimed internal governance of the most advanced country in the world.""Analysts said that the frequent occurrence of similar incidents shows that the error correction mechanism in the US has failed. Apart from this, racism and the proliferation of guns are also clear examples of the failure of error correction mechanisms, experts noted.",WORLD,AMERICAS,"A resident of East Palestine in the state of Ohio, US, angrily points during a town hall meeting held by the US

Greek scholar believes in ‘endless possibilities and vast land’ between China-Greece exchanges,Xu Liuliu,2023-09-14,"Chongqing, Sichuan, Shandong… Stelios Virvidakis expectantly plans his next China tour before a visit by the Global Times at his office in Athens, Greece. The University of Athens professor has grown far busier recently since he and four other Greek scholars launched the Center of Chinese and Greek Ancient Civilizations in February. Over the summer, the center has received two scholars from China who have given lectures on the history of China, and other visiting guests from places like Israel, who offered their views on Chinese medicine and its history, and a lecturer from France with insights in Chinese mathematics and how scholars in ancient China studied the living science.""Students found them to be very interesting and greatly appreciated the lectures,"" Virvidakis told the Global Times. ""Greece and China share so many similarities. So in my opinion, the horizon for our cooperation and exchanges is vast. There are endless possibilities which have not been explored.""Mutual learning Chinese President Xi Jinping replied to a letter from Virvidakis and four other Greek scholars earlier in 2023, extending congratulations over the founding of the Center of Chinese and Greek Ancient Civilizations.Hailing the long history of the Chinese civilization and profound influence of the ancient Greek civilization, Xi said in the letter that more than 2,000 years ago, the two civilizations shone brightly on the two ends of the Eurasian continent, jointly making a fundamental contribution to the evolution of human civilization.Greece's golden era produced many of its great philosophers and literary giants. The era coincided with a period in China in which ""a hundred schools of thought contended with each other"" and flourished together.As early as the 4th century BC, China was known to the Greeks by a beautiful name: Sērikḗ. In the 16th century, Euclid's Elements was introduced into China, paving the way for scientific exchanges between China and the West. The story of Prometheus narrated by Aeschylus was an inspiration to many Chinese revolutionaries. The Republic by Plato and Politics by Aristotle are also among the Greek classics known to have long made a name for themselves in China.In the eyes of Virvidakis, Chinese civilization has always been a culture that attracts people though the language is difficult. However, Chinese art, Chinese painting, Chinese poetry, especially love poems, even detective stories about China, are incredibly fascinating. Chinese director Zhang Yimou, and movies like Farewell My Concubine and Raise the Red Lantern starring Gong Li, are also very popular. Greek archaeologists who are interested in Chinese archeology want to know how China explores the past.In other art forms, the mythology and theater, ""we have tragedy, which is our own tradition. You have Chinese opera with music."" Actors and artists always want to study similarities and look at the differences, which is also the commitment of the center to promoting exchanges and mutual learning between the two civilizations and promoting the development of civilizations in various countries. China also has this appeal because people in the West think ""it's very different, it's exotic, something strange, but then they realize that it's beautiful for them."" So ""they find a lot of aspects that they have not thought about before in order to understand.""

Tiantan, a UNESCO World Heritage Site built in 1420, in Beijing Photo: VCGPhilosophy, a way of life There is a feeling among some people in the West that the Chinese system is different in some ways, said the professor. For instance,the European and American systems place great emphasis on individual rights, but China takes a more holistic approach in which ""harmony, social harmony is more important in sovereign.""""We are not exactly the same and there are also differences. But I don't believe in the so-called clash of civilizations theory that the clash is very deep and we can't live together with our differences,"" he told the Global Times. ""In fact we can live together and have peaceful exchanges. As I said, I don't think there is any danger of Greece threatening China or China occupying Greece.""In February, Virvidakis held a lecture at the center's launching ceremony, titled Philosophy is a Way of Life. Philosophy is not just theory, he said, noting that in ancient Greece and China it didn't mean just making theories about the universe, nature, god, or much of the unknown world. ""It told you how to 'organize' your life to feel happy and achieve harmony with others."" Western philosophy cannot be understood just by itself as there are also Chinese and Indian schools of philosophy among others. ""It is easier to see some similarities in ideas between Confucius and Socrates or Confucius and Aristotle,"" said Virvidakis, explaining why he is so fond of Chinese philosophy, especially Confucius thought. A simple question about what is a good life has a variety of answers in different philosophical theories.  But studying philosophy is practical and a way of life. Modern people don't just derive happiness from materialism. They need art and other emotionally stirring elements in life. In different parts and different cultures of the world,people can share similarities in emotion and sentiment.Virvidakis said that one of the most important reasons for his involving in such studies and exchanges was because ""I'm interested and I want to learn more. I'm a student too. When you are a teacher in your whole life, you're going to be a student.""",ARTS,CULTURE & LEISURE,The University of Athens Photo: VCG,"Reporter, Beijing","Global Times senior reporter, mainly covers the reporting of movies, TV, music and culture news.",43,880,<FreqDist with 16 samples and 473 outcomes>

 The first Saudi ambassador to Palestine Naif bin Bandar Al-Sudairi arrived in the West Bank on Tuesday, the official Palestinian news agency WAFA reported.Leading an official delegation, Al-Sudairi, the non-resident ambassador to Palestine and non-resident consul general in Jerusalem, presented his credentials to Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas at the presidency headquarters in Ramallah, it said.Al-Sudairi's arrival comes amid Israel's efforts to normalize relations with Saudi Arabia.During their meeting, Abbas welcomed Al-Sudairi and said his visit to Palestine and his appointment as Saudi ambassador to the State of Palestine would contribute to ""strengthening the strong fraternal relations that bind the two countries and the two brotherly peoples.""The Saudi ambassador said he hoped that his visit would be ""a successful beginning for strengthening relations in all fields,"" stressing his country's firm and supportive positions for the Palestinian people and their just cause.Earlier in the day, Al-Sudairi told reporters in a statement that ""the Arab Peace Initiative is the basic point in any upcoming agreement,"" after being asked about the fate of the initiative in the event of reaching a normalization deal between Saudi Arabia and Israel.The Arab Peace Initiative was launched in 2002 after it was drafted by Saudi Arabia and adopted by the Arab League.The initiative calls for an end to the conflict between Israel and Palestine and the normalization of relations between Israel and Arab states, in exchange for an Israeli withdrawal from the areas it gained since 1967 and proper settlement to the issue of Palestinian refugees.The Palestinians demanded the establishment of an independent state alongside Israel in all of the Palestinian territories occupied by Israel in 1967, including the entire West Bank and the Gaza Strip, with East Jerusalem as its capital.The Saudi ambassador also confirmed that his country intends to open a consulate in East Jerusalem soon.",PHOTO,WORLD,"Saudi ambassador to Palestine Naif bin Bandar Al-Sudairi (Front) arrives at the Palestinian foreign ministry headquarters in the West Bank city of Ramallah, on Sept. 26, 2023.(Photo: Xinhua)",Author details not found,Author details not found,12,313,<FreqDist with 15 samples and 181 outcomes>
China releases a white paper on its proposals and actions on building a global community of shared future,GT staff reporters,2023-09-26," The Chinese government released a white paper on Tuesday to introduce the theoretical base, practice and development of a global community of shared future, as by presenting China's vision of the course of human development, it counters the hegemonic thinking of certain countries that seek supremacy. The white paper, titled ""A Global Community of Shared Future: China's Proposals and Actions,"" introduced the background for China to raise the concept of a global community of shared future as the world is undergoing changes on a scale unseen in a century with various problems posing unprecedented challenges for human society. The zero-sum game is doomed to fail, the white paper said. But certain countries still cling to this mindset, blindly pursuing absolute security and monopolistic advantages, which will do nothing for their development in the long run but create a major threat to the world. It is increasingly obvious that the obsession with superior strength, and the zero-sum mentality are in conflict with the needs of our times, the white paper said, pointing out that the new era calls for new ideas. To build a global community of shared future is to pursue openness, inclusiveness, mutual benefit, equity and justice, the white paper said. The goal is not to replace one system or civilization with another. Instead, it is about countries with different social systems, ideologies, histories, shared rights, and shared responsibilities in global affairs. The vision of a global community of shared future stands on the right side of history and on the side of human progress. It introduces a new approach for international relations, provides new ideas for global governance, opens up new prospects for international exchanges and draws a new blueprint for a better world, according to the white paper. Such important vision transcends outdated mindsets such as zero-sum game, power politics, and Cold War confrontations. It has become the overall goal of China's major-country diplomacy in the new era, and a great banner that leads the trend of the times and the direction of human progress. The concept of a global community of shared future has deep roots in China's profound cultural heritage and its unique experience of modernization. It carries forward the diplomatic traditions of China and draws on the outstanding achievements of all other civilizations, the white paper said. It also manifests China's time-honored historical traditions, distinct characteristics of the times, and a wealth of humanistic values.  The white paper also pointed out the direction and plan to build a global community of shared future including pressing ahead with a new type of economic globalization in which countries need to pursue a policy of openness and explicitly oppose protectionism, the erection of fences and barriers, unilateral sanctions, and maximum-pressure tactics, so as to connect economies and jointly build an open world economy. Some countries are seeking to decouple from China, enclosing themselves in ""small yards, high fences,"" which will ultimately only backfire, the white paper said. Also, some people overstate the need to ""reduce dependence"" and ""de-risk,"" which is essentially creating new risks. The direction and the plan also include following a peaceful development plan, fostering a new type of international relations, practicing true multilateralism and promoting the common values of humanity. Over the past decade, China has contributed its strength to building a global community of shared future with firm conviction and solid actions. For instance, by July 2023, more than three-quarters of countries in the world and over 30 international organizations had signed agreements on Belt and Road cooperation with China. The BRI originated in China but the opportunities and achievements it creates belong to the whole world. It's an initiative for economic cooperation, not for geopolitical or military alliances, and it's open and inclusive process that neither targets nor excludes any party, the white paper said. Among those BRI projects, for example, the China-Laos Railway began operation on December 3, 2021, with 167 tunnels and 301 bridges built in 11 years along its total length of 1,035 kilometers. The railway construction created more than 110,000 local jobs, and helped build about 2,000 kilometers of roads and canals for villages along the railway, benefiting local people. Besides the BRI, the Global Development Initiative, the Global Security Initiative and Global Civilization Initiative have evolved into a crucial cornerstone for building a global community of shared future, offering China's solutions to major challenges pertaining to peace and development for humanity. Facing constant flare-ups of hotspot issues, China has been committed to fulfilling its role as a responsible major country, pushing for the resolution of international and regional flashpoints, such as the Korean Peninsula, Palestine, the Iranian nuclear issue, Syria and Afghanistan, the white paper said. On the Ukraine issue, China has actively promoted talks for peace, put forth four points, four things that the international community should do together and three observations, and released China's position on the political settlement of the Ukraine crisis and has dispatched the special representative of the Chinese government on Eurasian affairs to engage in extensive interactions and exchanges with stakeholders on the political settlement of the Ukraine crisis. Also, through the mediation of China, Saudi Arabia and Iran achieve historic reconciliation earlier this year, setting a fine example for countries in the region to resolve disputes and differences and achieve good neighborly relations through dialogue and consultation, and catalyzing a wave of reconciliation in the Middle East. China has also proposed a range of regional and bilateral initiatives on building communities of shared future and working with stakeholders to build consensus and expand cooperation, there by playing a constructive role in promoting regional peace and development. It also boosts international cooperation in fields including fighting the COVID-19 pandemic, addressing disorder in cyberspace governance and dealing with the global climate challenge. Over the past decade, the vision of a global community of shared future has gained broader support. More countries and people have come to the understanding that this vision serves the common interests of humanity, represents popular calls for peace, justice and progress, and can create the greatest synergy among all nations for building a better world, the white paper said.",CHINA,POLITICS,Photo: Li Xuanmin/GT,Author details not found,Author details not found,33,1000,<FreqDist with 17 samples and 603 outcomes>

F-35: Closer Look at Colossally Costly Jet That Just Can’t Seem to Stay Airborne,Sputnik,2023-09-21,"A US Marine Corps F-35B went down over South Carolina on Sunday after its pilot ejected mid-flight for reasons unknown. Why do F-35s seem so crash-prone? What’s wrong with them? And what role does the waste and fraud in the US military-industrial complex play in creating such a Frankenstein’s monster of an aircraft? Sputnik explores.Debris from the F-35B that went missing over South Carolina on September 17 was found in Williamsburg County, South Carolina, about two hours northeast of Joint Base Charleston on Monday following more than a day of frantic searching by the military. An as yet unspecified “mishap” was blamed for the accident. The pilot escaped unscathed.“The mishap is currently under investigation, and we are unable to provide additional details to preserve the integrity of the investigative process,” the Marine Corps said in a statement Monday. The Marines ordered a two-day global pause in all aerial operations, with the errant F-35B becoming the third major aviation-related accident suffered by the military branch in less than two months.Air units will be discussing “fundamentals of safe flight operations, ground safety, maintenance and flight procedures, and maintaining combat readiness,” the Marine Corps said.How Many F-35s Have Been Lost?Since it started being introduced into service with the Marines (2015), the US Air Force (2016), and the US Navy (2019) and began to be exported to foreign clients (starting with Israel in 2018), the F-35 has gained an unenviable reputation of being a costly, buggy, and crash-prone jet, with the F-35B that went down over South Carolina last week being at least the 11th Lightning II lost since 2018.On September 28, 2018, a US Marine Corps F-35B crashed during a flight near Marine Corps Air Station Beaufort in South Carolina, with a faulty fuel tube blamed for the incident. The pilot emerged unscathed.On April 9, 2019, a Japanese Self- Defense Force F-35A went down off Honshu, Japan. The pilot was killed after losing his bearings and suffering “special disorientation” mid-flight over the ocean.On May 19, 2020, a US Air Force F-35A from the 58th Fighter Squadron crashed while performing a landing at Eglin Air Force Base in western Florida. Pilot error (trying to land at excessive speed) and a mechanical defect related to a flight control glitch that left the plane’s tail unresponsive were blamed. The pilot survived.On September 29, 2020, a US Marine Corps F-35B was lost over Imperial County, California after colliding with a KC-130 tanker during midflight refueling. The tanker crew managed to bring their aircraft down for a hard landing. The F-35 pilot ejected successfully.On November 17, 2021, a British Royal Air Force F-35B plunged into the Mediterranean Sea after its pilot ejected during routine operations. That crash was ultimately blamed on a protective cover getting wedged into the plane’s engine intake.On January 4, 2022, a South Korean Air Force F-35A suffering from issues with its onboard avionics carried out an emergency belly landing. Investigators blamed a bird striking the warplane’s landing gear mid-flight. The pilot emerged unharmed.On January 24, 2022, a US Navy F-35C plunged into the South China Sea after making a hard landing on the USS Carl Vinson super carrier. The pilot and six sailors on the deck of the aircraft carrier were injured. A Navy investigation attributed the incident to pilot error.On October 19, 2022, another F-35, this one from the US Air Force, crashed at Hill Air Force Base in Utah during a training mission. The pilot ejected safely. It was later determined that turbulent air somehow confused the jet’s onboard avionics to the point where the aircraft became uncontrollable.On December 1, 2022, a Marine Corps F-35B collapsed on a military base in Japan after suffering a landing gear failure during training. No one was injured.Finally, on December 15, 2022, a US Navy F-35B crashed while attempting to perform a vertical landing at Naval Air Station Joint Reserve Base Fort Worth in Texas during testing of the jet’s systems. A “harmonic resonance” issue related to the jet’s Pratt & Whitney F135 engine was blamed, with the Pentagon halting further F-35 deliveries by Lockheed until an investigation was concluded.What’s Wrong With the F-35?Nearly 17 years after the F-35’s first flight, and eight years after its adoption into service, the F-35 continues to maintain a troublingly long list of technical bugs affecting both hardware and software. The aircraft, which has an astronomical total estimated purchase and sustainment price tag of over $1.7 trillion, and a per-plane cost of $70-$90 million, has faced years of harsh criticism from US officials, including former President Donald Trump at one point, who said the jet’s costs had spiraled “out of control.”At its heart, the F-35 is the product of an idea that metastasized in the Pentagon after the end of the Cold War, envisioning an all-in-one fighter platform which could be used by every branch of the military, equipped with vertical take-off and landing capability, and carry out a broad array of missions using a variety of onboard weapons. The do-it-all jet was supposed to replace nearly all of America’s fourth-gen fighter, strike, and ground attack aircraft, including the F-16 Falcon, the F/A-18 Hornet and Super Hornet, the AV-8B Harrier II, and others.The jet features just a single onboard engine – the aforementioned Pratt & Whitney F135, with engine-related troubles not only regularly referred to by watchdogs as a “leading driver” of the F-35’s problems remaining “mission capable,” but also making its operation over enemy territory or over the sea risky, since if something goes wrong, the plane doesn’t have a backup engine to limp home with.Throughout its production cycle, the F-35 Lightning II has suffered a dizzying and seemingly endless list of technical problems, from neck-snapping ejection seats to problems, ironically, while operating in stormy weather.In its 2023 report, the congressional Government Accountability Office revealed that the F-35 program “continues to experience schedule delays, cost growth, and late deliveries,” with procurement costs jumping by $13.4 billion since 2019, and modernization behind schedule and over budget.“As of January 2023, of the 821 open deficiencies, the program office characterized five of these as category 1 [i.e. critical issues which could jeopardize flight safety and security], and 816 as category 2, [i.e. those which could impede or constrain mission success].”In all, between December 2006 and 2023, the GAO has reported a whopping 277 category 1 and 2,467 category 2 deficiencies with the aircraft, among them serious issues like cabin over-pressurization, problems with the jets’ night vision systems, software bugs, radar issues, corrosion, ejection seats which could snap pilots’ necks, etc.Is a Culture of Largess to Blame?Sunday’s accident in South Carolina is the latest piece of F-35-related bad news for Lockheed Martin. In June, it was reported that the Pentagon had halted the delivery of any additional upgraded F-35s until major issues related to new Technology Refresh 3 (TR-3) hardware and weapons-related software were resolved. DoD F-35 program director Mike Schmidt told Congress in March that the risk assessment related to the TR-3 hardware upgrade wouldn’t be finished until April 2024.Despite the delays and array of technical problems, the weapons giant has continued to rack up generous contracts related to F-35 procurement and production. For example, in July, the US Navy ordered a $490 million package of equipment from Lockheed “to procure various material mod kits, special test/tooling equipment, as well as…product engineering” for already delivered, but defective planes. In August, Lockheed received another $606 million “fixed-price incentive (firm-target) undefinitized” contract “for long lead time materials, parts, components, and efforts to support of maintaining on-time production and delivery of 173 Lot 19 F-35 Joint Strike Fighter aircraft for Foreign Military Sales (FMS) customers and non-US Department of Defense (DOD) participants.”The terms of the contracts seem to be the culprit behind the F-35’s soaring costs (and Lockheed’s soaring profits, despite delivery of defective products), with so-called “cost-plus” and “undefinitized” contracts effectively making any overruns the buyer’s problem – i.e. that of US taxpayers, and of citizens of any country unfortunate enough to pen contracts for the planes from Lockheed.What About America’s Competitors?The worst part about the F-35’s troublesome history seems to be that the F-35 has already become ""obsolete"" in the sense that many of the US and NATO’s competitors have obtained the ability to defeat them, with Russia and China gaining capabilities to track and target the jets going back to the mid-to-late 2010s. In April, Iran announced that its engineers had created advanced radar technologies to not only detect F-35s, but identify the radar signature of individual F-35 planes, enabling the Islamic Republic to plan defensive operations accordingly.",WORLD,AMERICAS,Picture description not found,Author details not found,Author details not found,60,1305,<FreqDist with 18 samples and 775 outcomes>
Toxic explosion in Nebraska shows US unable to take issues affecting public security seriously: experts,Xu Yelu,2023-09-15,"Barely two months after an explosion in Louisiana, a train carrying toxic perchloric acid has exploded in a Nebraska rail yard on Thursday, prompting evacuation orders to be issued, as huge plumes are seen engulfing the city. Experts said the incident shows the US has been unable to take seriously and overcome major issues affecting public safety and the environment and ecology in the country.The incident happened on Union Pacific Railroad tracks in the city of North Platte. North Platte Volunteer Fire Department announced that they would order those living in the area to evacuate due to the toxic smoke from the railroad, according to media reports.In a post on social media platforms, it said that ""Emergency evacuation for the area between splinter and front North of railroad track due fire at the railroad involving heavy toxic smoke.""In a statement to DailyMail.com, Union Pacific Railroad said that an explosion occurred inside a container which resulted in several railcars catching fire. The railcar did not derail, the company said, and had been in the yard for several hours.Union Pacific said that one of the containers contained a hazardous chemical called perchloric acid, according to Daily Mail.Perchloric is a hazardous material used in food, drugs and biocidal products, as well as explosives, according to the report.Two months ago, a fire at a Louisiana chemical plant triggered explosions that shook homes several miles away and sent flames and smoke billowing into the air in mid-July, prompting emergency officials to urge a few hundred nearby residents to shelter indoors for several hours and to turn off their air conditioners, the Associated Press reported.Antiquated infrastructure and the outdated transportation were one factor. Another was a flawed system of governance in the US transport industry, experts noted. There is no doubt that the US has serious loopholes in the transportation management of hazardous substances, and the relevant error correction mechanism is in fact not effective, which means that this kind of thing will occur in the future, Li Haidong, a professor at the China Foreign Affairs University, told the Global Times on Friday.This shows that the US has been unable to take seriously and overcome serious and major issues affecting public safety and the environment and ecology in the country, Li said. ""It must be said that this is a great irony to the self-proclaimed internal governance of the most advanced country in the world.""Analysts said that the frequent occurrence of similar incidents shows that the error correction mechanism in the US has failed. Apart from this, racism and the proliferation of guns are also clear examples of the failure of error correction mechanisms, experts noted.",WORLD,AMERICAS,"A resident of East Palestine in the state of Ohio, US, angrily points during a town hall meeting held by the US

Greek scholar believes in ‘endless possibilities and vast land’ between China-Greece exchanges,Xu Liuliu,2023-09-14,"Chongqing, Sichuan, Shandong… Stelios Virvidakis expectantly plans his next China tour before a visit by the Global Times at his office in Athens, Greece. The University of Athens professor has grown far busier recently since he and four other Greek scholars launched the Center of Chinese and Greek Ancient Civilizations in February. Over the summer, the center has received two scholars from China who have given lectures on the history of China, and other visiting guests from places like Israel, who offered their views on Chinese medicine and its history, and a lecturer from France with insights in Chinese mathematics and how scholars in ancient China studied the living science.""Students found them to be very interesting and greatly appreciated the lectures,"" Virvidakis told the Global Times. ""Greece and China share so many similarities. So in my opinion, the horizon for our cooperation and exchanges is vast. There are endless possibilities which have not been explored.""Mutual learning Chinese President Xi Jinping replied to a letter from Virvidakis and four other Greek scholars earlier in 2023, extending congratulations over the founding of the Center of Chinese and Greek Ancient Civilizations.Hailing the long history of the Chinese civilization and profound influence of the ancient Greek civilization, Xi said in the letter that more than 2,000 years ago, the two civilizations shone brightly on the two ends of the Eurasian continent, jointly making a fundamental contribution to the evolution of human civilization.Greece's golden era produced many of its great philosophers and literary giants. The era coincided with a period in China in which ""a hundred schools of thought contended with each other"" and flourished together.As early as the 4th century BC, China was known to the Greeks by a beautiful name: Sērikḗ. In the 16th century, Euclid's Elements was introduced into China, paving the way for scientific exchanges between China and the West. The story of Prometheus narrated by Aeschylus was an inspiration to many Chinese revolutionaries. The Republic by Plato and Politics by Aristotle are also among the Greek classics known to have long made a name for themselves in China.In the eyes of Virvidakis, Chinese civilization has always been a culture that attracts people though the language is difficult. However, Chinese art, Chinese painting, Chinese poetry, especially love poems, even detective stories about China, are incredibly fascinating. Chinese director Zhang Yimou, and movies like Farewell My Concubine and Raise the Red Lantern starring Gong Li, are also very popular. Greek archaeologists who are interested in Chinese archeology want to know how China explores the past.In other art forms, the mythology and theater, ""we have tragedy, which is our own tradition. You have Chinese opera with music."" Actors and artists always want to study similarities and look at the differences, which is also the commitment of the center to promoting exchanges and mutual learning between the two civilizations and promoting the development of civilizations in various countries. China also has this appeal because people in the West think ""it's very different, it's exotic, something strange, but then they realize that it's beautiful for them."" So ""they find a lot of aspects that they have not thought about before in order to understand.""

Tiantan, a UNESCO World Heritage Site built in 1420, in Beijing Photo: VCGPhilosophy, a way of life There is a feeling among some people in the West that the Chinese system is different in some ways, said the professor. For instance,the European and American systems place great emphasis on individual rights, but China takes a more holistic approach in which ""harmony, social harmony is more important in sovereign.""""We are not exactly the same and there are also differences. But I don't believe in the so-called clash of civilizations theory that the clash is very deep and we can't live together with our differences,"" he told the Global Times. ""In fact we can live together and have peaceful exchanges. As I said, I don't think there is any danger of Greece threatening China or China occupying Greece.""In February, Virvidakis held a lecture at the center's launching ceremony, titled Philosophy is a Way of Life. Philosophy is not just theory, he said, noting that in ancient Greece and China it didn't mean just making theories about the universe, nature, god, or much of the unknown world. ""It told you how to 'organize' your life to feel happy and achieve harmony with others."" Western philosophy cannot be understood just by itself as there are also Chinese and Indian schools of philosophy among others. ""It is easier to see some similarities in ideas between Confucius and Socrates or Confucius and Aristotle,"" said Virvidakis, explaining why he is so fond of Chinese philosophy, especially Confucius thought. A simple question about what is a good life has a variety of answers in different philosophical theories.  But studying philosophy is practical and a way of life. Modern people don't just derive happiness from materialism. They need art and other emotionally stirring elements in life. In different parts and different cultures of the world,people can share similarities in emotion and sentiment.Virvidakis said that one of the most important reasons for his involving in such studies and exchanges was because ""I'm interested and I want to learn more. I'm a student too. When you are a teacher in your whole life, you're going to be a student.""",ARTS,CULTURE & LEISURE,The University of Athens Photo: VCG,"Reporter, Beijing","Global Times senior reporter, mainly covers the reporting of movies, TV, music and culture news.",43,880,<FreqDist with 16 samples and 473 outcomes>

 The first Saudi ambassador to Palestine Naif bin Bandar Al-Sudairi arrived in the West Bank on Tuesday, the official Palestinian news agency WAFA reported.Leading an official delegation, Al-Sudairi, the non-resident ambassador to Palestine and non-resident consul general in Jerusalem, presented his credentials to Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas at the presidency headquarters in Ramallah, it said.Al-Sudairi's arrival comes amid Israel's efforts to normalize relations with Saudi Arabia.During their meeting, Abbas welcomed Al-Sudairi and said his visit to Palestine and his appointment as Saudi ambassador to the State of Palestine would contribute to ""strengthening the strong fraternal relations that bind the two countries and the two brotherly peoples.""The Saudi ambassador said he hoped that his visit would be ""a successful beginning for strengthening relations in all fields,"" stressing his country's firm and supportive positions for the Palestinian people and their just cause.Earlier in the day, Al-Sudairi told reporters in a statement that ""the Arab Peace Initiative is the basic point in any upcoming agreement,"" after being asked about the fate of the initiative in the event of reaching a normalization deal between Saudi Arabia and Israel.The Arab Peace Initiative was launched in 2002 after it was drafted by Saudi Arabia and adopted by the Arab League.The initiative calls for an end to the conflict between Israel and Palestine and the normalization of relations between Israel and Arab states, in exchange for an Israeli withdrawal from the areas it gained since 1967 and proper settlement to the issue of Palestinian refugees.The Palestinians demanded the establishment of an independent state alongside Israel in all of the Palestinian territories occupied by Israel in 1967, including the entire West Bank and the Gaza Strip, with East Jerusalem as its capital.The Saudi ambassador also confirmed that his country intends to open a consulate in East Jerusalem soon.",PHOTO,WORLD,"Saudi ambassador to Palestine Naif bin Bandar Al-Sudairi (Front) arrives at the Palestinian foreign ministry headquarters in the West Bank city of Ramallah, on Sept. 26, 2023.(Photo: Xinhua)",Author details not found,Author details not found,12,313,<FreqDist with 15 samples and 181 outcomes>
China releases a white paper on its proposals and actions on building a global community of shared future,GT staff reporters,2023-09-26," The Chinese government released a white paper on Tuesday to introduce the theoretical base, practice and development of a global community of shared future, as by presenting China's vision of the course of human development, it counters the hegemonic thinking of certain countries that seek supremacy. The white paper, titled ""A Global Community of Shared Future: China's Proposals and Actions,"" introduced the background for China to raise the concept of a global community of shared future as the world is undergoing changes on a scale unseen in a century with various problems posing unprecedented challenges for human society. The zero-sum game is doomed to fail, the white paper said. But certain countries still cling to this mindset, blindly pursuing absolute security and monopolistic advantages, which will do nothing for their development in the long run but create a major threat to the world. It is increasingly obvious that the obsession with superior strength, and the zero-sum mentality are in conflict with the needs of our times, the white paper said, pointing out that the new era calls for new ideas. To build a global community of shared future is to pursue openness, inclusiveness, mutual benefit, equity and justice, the white paper said. The goal is not to replace one system or civilization with another. Instead, it is about countries with different social systems, ideologies, histories, shared rights, and shared responsibilities in global affairs. The vision of a global community of shared future stands on the right side of history and on the side of human progress. It introduces a new approach for international relations, provides new ideas for global governance, opens up new prospects for international exchanges and draws a new blueprint for a better world, according to the white paper. Such important vision transcends outdated mindsets such as zero-sum game, power politics, and Cold War confrontations. It has become the overall goal of China's major-country diplomacy in the new era, and a great banner that leads the trend of the times and the direction of human progress. The concept of a global community of shared future has deep roots in China's profound cultural heritage and its unique experience of modernization. It carries forward the diplomatic traditions of China and draws on the outstanding achievements of all other civilizations, the white paper said. It also manifests China's time-honored historical traditions, distinct characteristics of the times, and a wealth of humanistic values.  The white paper also pointed out the direction and plan to build a global community of shared future including pressing ahead with a new type of economic globalization in which countries need to pursue a policy of openness and explicitly oppose protectionism, the erection of fences and barriers, unilateral sanctions, and maximum-pressure tactics, so as to connect economies and jointly build an open world economy. Some countries are seeking to decouple from China, enclosing themselves in ""small yards, high fences,"" which will ultimately only backfire, the white paper said. Also, some people overstate the need to ""reduce dependence"" and ""de-risk,"" which is essentially creating new risks. The direction and the plan also include following a peaceful development plan, fostering a new type of international relations, practicing true multilateralism and promoting the common values of humanity. Over the past decade, China has contributed its strength to building a global community of shared future with firm conviction and solid actions. For instance, by July 2023, more than three-quarters of countries in the world and over 30 international organizations had signed agreements on Belt and Road cooperation with China. The BRI originated in China but the opportunities and achievements it creates belong to the whole world. It's an initiative for economic cooperation, not for geopolitical or military alliances, and it's open and inclusive process that neither targets nor excludes any party, the white paper said. Among those BRI projects, for example, the China-Laos Railway began operation on December 3, 2021, with 167 tunnels and 301 bridges built in 11 years along its total length of 1,035 kilometers. The railway construction created more than 110,000 local jobs, and helped build about 2,000 kilometers of roads and canals for villages along the railway, benefiting local people. Besides the BRI, the Global Development Initiative, the Global Security Initiative and Global Civilization Initiative have evolved into a crucial cornerstone for building a global community of shared future, offering China's solutions to major challenges pertaining to peace and development for humanity. Facing constant flare-ups of hotspot issues, China has been committed to fulfilling its role as a responsible major country, pushing for the resolution of international and regional flashpoints, such as the Korean Peninsula, Palestine, the Iranian nuclear issue, Syria and Afghanistan, the white paper said. On the Ukraine issue, China has actively promoted talks for peace, put forth four points, four things that the international community should do together and three observations, and released China's position on the political settlement of the Ukraine crisis and has dispatched the special representative of the Chinese government on Eurasian affairs to engage in extensive interactions and exchanges with stakeholders on the political settlement of the Ukraine crisis. Also, through the mediation of China, Saudi Arabia and Iran achieve historic reconciliation earlier this year, setting a fine example for countries in the region to resolve disputes and differences and achieve good neighborly relations through dialogue and consultation, and catalyzing a wave of reconciliation in the Middle East. China has also proposed a range of regional and bilateral initiatives on building communities of shared future and working with stakeholders to build consensus and expand cooperation, there by playing a constructive role in promoting regional peace and development. It also boosts international cooperation in fields including fighting the COVID-19 pandemic, addressing disorder in cyberspace governance and dealing with the global climate challenge. Over the past decade, the vision of a global community of shared future has gained broader support. More countries and people have come to the understanding that this vision serves the common interests of humanity, represents popular calls for peace, justice and progress, and can create the greatest synergy among all nations for building a better world, the white paper said.",CHINA,POLITICS,Photo: Li Xuanmin/GT,Author details not found,Author details not found,33,1000,<FreqDist with 17 samples and 603 outcomes>

F-35: Closer Look at Colossally Costly Jet That Just Can’t Seem to Stay Airborne,Sputnik,2023-09-21,"A US Marine Corps F-35B went down over South Carolina on Sunday after its pilot ejected mid-flight for reasons unknown. Why do F-35s seem so crash-prone? What’s wrong with them? And what role does the waste and fraud in the US military-industrial complex play in creating such a Frankenstein’s monster of an aircraft? Sputnik explores.Debris from the F-35B that went missing over South Carolina on September 17 was found in Williamsburg County, South Carolina, about two hours northeast of Joint Base Charleston on Monday following more than a day of frantic searching by the military. An as yet unspecified “mishap” was blamed for the accident. The pilot escaped unscathed.“The mishap is currently under investigation, and we are unable to provide additional details to preserve the integrity of the investigative process,” the Marine Corps said in a statement Monday. The Marines ordered a two-day global pause in all aerial operations, with the errant F-35B becoming the third major aviation-related accident suffered by the military branch in less than two months.Air units will be discussing “fundamentals of safe flight operations, ground safety, maintenance and flight procedures, and maintaining combat readiness,” the Marine Corps said.How Many F-35s Have Been Lost?Since it started being introduced into service with the Marines (2015), the US Air Force (2016), and the US Navy (2019) and began to be exported to foreign clients (starting with Israel in 2018), the F-35 has gained an unenviable reputation of being a costly, buggy, and crash-prone jet, with the F-35B that went down over South Carolina last week being at least the 11th Lightning II lost since 2018.On September 28, 2018, a US Marine Corps F-35B crashed during a flight near Marine Corps Air Station Beaufort in South Carolina, with a faulty fuel tube blamed for the incident. The pilot emerged unscathed.On April 9, 2019, a Japanese Self- Defense Force F-35A went down off Honshu, Japan. The pilot was killed after losing his bearings and suffering “special disorientation” mid-flight over the ocean.On May 19, 2020, a US Air Force F-35A from the 58th Fighter Squadron crashed while performing a landing at Eglin Air Force Base in western Florida. Pilot error (trying to land at excessive speed) and a mechanical defect related to a flight control glitch that left the plane’s tail unresponsive were blamed. The pilot survived.On September 29, 2020, a US Marine Corps F-35B was lost over Imperial County, California after colliding with a KC-130 tanker during midflight refueling. The tanker crew managed to bring their aircraft down for a hard landing. The F-35 pilot ejected successfully.On November 17, 2021, a British Royal Air Force F-35B plunged into the Mediterranean Sea after its pilot ejected during routine operations. That crash was ultimately blamed on a protective cover getting wedged into the plane’s engine intake.On January 4, 2022, a South Korean Air Force F-35A suffering from issues with its onboard avionics carried out an emergency belly landing. Investigators blamed a bird striking the warplane’s landing gear mid-flight. The pilot emerged unharmed.On January 24, 2022, a US Navy F-35C plunged into the South China Sea after making a hard landing on the USS Carl Vinson super carrier. The pilot and six sailors on the deck of the aircraft carrier were injured. A Navy investigation attributed the incident to pilot error.On October 19, 2022, another F-35, this one from the US Air Force, crashed at Hill Air Force Base in Utah during a training mission. The pilot ejected safely. It was later determined that turbulent air somehow confused the jet’s onboard avionics to the point where the aircraft became uncontrollable.On December 1, 2022, a Marine Corps F-35B collapsed on a military base in Japan after suffering a landing gear failure during training. No one was injured.Finally, on December 15, 2022, a US Navy F-35B crashed while attempting to perform a vertical landing at Naval Air Station Joint Reserve Base Fort Worth in Texas during testing of the jet’s systems. A “harmonic resonance” issue related to the jet’s Pratt & Whitney F135 engine was blamed, with the Pentagon halting further F-35 deliveries by Lockheed until an investigation was concluded.What’s Wrong With the F-35?Nearly 17 years after the F-35’s first flight, and eight years after its adoption into service, the F-35 continues to maintain a troublingly long list of technical bugs affecting both hardware and software. The aircraft, which has an astronomical total estimated purchase and sustainment price tag of over $1.7 trillion, and a per-plane cost of $70-$90 million, has faced years of harsh criticism from US officials, including former President Donald Trump at one point, who said the jet’s costs had spiraled “out of control.”At its heart, the F-35 is the product of an idea that metastasized in the Pentagon after the end of the Cold War, envisioning an all-in-one fighter platform which could be used by every branch of the military, equipped with vertical take-off and landing capability, and carry out a broad array of missions using a variety of onboard weapons. The do-it-all jet was supposed to replace nearly all of America’s fourth-gen fighter, strike, and ground attack aircraft, including the F-16 Falcon, the F/A-18 Hornet and Super Hornet, the AV-8B Harrier II, and others.The jet features just a single onboard engine – the aforementioned Pratt & Whitney F135, with engine-related troubles not only regularly referred to by watchdogs as a “leading driver” of the F-35’s problems remaining “mission capable,” but also making its operation over enemy territory or over the sea risky, since if something goes wrong, the plane doesn’t have a backup engine to limp home with.Throughout its production cycle, the F-35 Lightning II has suffered a dizzying and seemingly endless list of technical problems, from neck-snapping ejection seats to problems, ironically, while operating in stormy weather.In its 2023 report, the congressional Government Accountability Office revealed that the F-35 program “continues to experience schedule delays, cost growth, and late deliveries,” with procurement costs jumping by $13.4 billion since 2019, and modernization behind schedule and over budget.“As of January 2023, of the 821 open deficiencies, the program office characterized five of these as category 1 [i.e. critical issues which could jeopardize flight safety and security], and 816 as category 2, [i.e. those which could impede or constrain mission success].”In all, between December 2006 and 2023, the GAO has reported a whopping 277 category 1 and 2,467 category 2 deficiencies with the aircraft, among them serious issues like cabin over-pressurization, problems with the jets’ night vision systems, software bugs, radar issues, corrosion, ejection seats which could snap pilots’ necks, etc.Is a Culture of Largess to Blame?Sunday’s accident in South Carolina is the latest piece of F-35-related bad news for Lockheed Martin. In June, it was reported that the Pentagon had halted the delivery of any additional upgraded F-35s until major issues related to new Technology Refresh 3 (TR-3) hardware and weapons-related software were resolved. DoD F-35 program director Mike Schmidt told Congress in March that the risk assessment related to the TR-3 hardware upgrade wouldn’t be finished until April 2024.Despite the delays and array of technical problems, the weapons giant has continued to rack up generous contracts related to F-35 procurement and production. For example, in July, the US Navy ordered a $490 million package of equipment from Lockheed “to procure various material mod kits, special test/tooling equipment, as well as…product engineering” for already delivered, but defective planes. In August, Lockheed received another $606 million “fixed-price incentive (firm-target) undefinitized” contract “for long lead time materials, parts, components, and efforts to support of maintaining on-time production and delivery of 173 Lot 19 F-35 Joint Strike Fighter aircraft for Foreign Military Sales (FMS) customers and non-US Department of Defense (DOD) participants.”The terms of the contracts seem to be the culprit behind the F-35’s soaring costs (and Lockheed’s soaring profits, despite delivery of defective products), with so-called “cost-plus” and “undefinitized” contracts effectively making any overruns the buyer’s problem – i.e. that of US taxpayers, and of citizens of any country unfortunate enough to pen contracts for the planes from Lockheed.What About America’s Competitors?The worst part about the F-35’s troublesome history seems to be that the F-35 has already become ""obsolete"" in the sense that many of the US and NATO’s competitors have obtained the ability to defeat them, with Russia and China gaining capabilities to track and target the jets going back to the mid-to-late 2010s. In April, Iran announced that its engineers had created advanced radar technologies to not only detect F-35s, but identify the radar signature of individual F-35 planes, enabling the Islamic Republic to plan defensive operations accordingly.",WORLD,AMERICAS,Picture description not found,Author details not found,Author details not found,60,1305,<FreqDist with 18 samples and 775 outcomes>
Toxic explosion in Nebraska shows US unable to take issues affecting public security seriously: experts,Xu Yelu,2023-09-15,"Barely two months after an explosion in Louisiana, a train carrying toxic perchloric acid has exploded in a Nebraska rail yard on Thursday, prompting evacuation orders to be issued, as huge plumes are seen engulfing the city. Experts said the incident shows the US has been unable to take seriously and overcome major issues affecting public safety and the environment and ecology in the country.The incident happened on Union Pacific Railroad tracks in the city of North Platte. North Platte Volunteer Fire Department announced that they would order those living in the area to evacuate due to the toxic smoke from the railroad, according to media reports.In a post on social media platforms, it said that ""Emergency evacuation for the area between splinter and front North of railroad track due fire at the railroad involving heavy toxic smoke.""In a statement to DailyMail.com, Union Pacific Railroad said that an explosion occurred inside a container which resulted in several railcars catching fire. The railcar did not derail, the company said, and had been in the yard for several hours.Union Pacific said that one of the containers contained a hazardous chemical called perchloric acid, according to Daily Mail.Perchloric is a hazardous material used in food, drugs and biocidal products, as well as explosives, according to the report.Two months ago, a fire at a Louisiana chemical plant triggered explosions that shook homes several miles away and sent flames and smoke billowing into the air in mid-July, prompting emergency officials to urge a few hundred nearby residents to shelter indoors for several hours and to turn off their air conditioners, the Associated Press reported.Antiquated infrastructure and the outdated transportation were one factor. Another was a flawed system of governance in the US transport industry, experts noted. There is no doubt that the US has serious loopholes in the transportation management of hazardous substances, and the relevant error correction mechanism is in fact not effective, which means that this kind of thing will occur in the future, Li Haidong, a professor at the China Foreign Affairs University, told the Global Times on Friday.This shows that the US has been unable to take seriously and overcome serious and major issues affecting public safety and the environment and ecology in the country, Li said. ""It must be said that this is a great irony to the self-proclaimed internal governance of the most advanced country in the world.""Analysts said that the frequent occurrence of similar incidents shows that the error correction mechanism in the US has failed. Apart from this, racism and the proliferation of guns are also clear examples of the failure of error correction mechanisms, experts noted.",WORLD,AMERICAS,"A resident of East Palestine in the state of Ohio, US, angrily points during a town hall meeting held by the US

Greek scholar believes in ‘endless possibilities and vast land’ between China-Greece exchanges,Xu Liuliu,2023-09-14,"Chongqing, Sichuan, Shandong… Stelios Virvidakis expectantly plans his next China tour before a visit by the Global Times at his office in Athens, Greece. The University of Athens professor has grown far busier recently since he and four other Greek scholars launched the Center of Chinese and Greek Ancient Civilizations in February. Over the summer, the center has received two scholars from China who have given lectures on the history of China, and other visiting guests from places like Israel, who offered their views on Chinese medicine and its history, and a lecturer from France with insights in Chinese mathematics and how scholars in ancient China studied the living science.""Students found them to be very interesting and greatly appreciated the lectures,"" Virvidakis told the Global Times. ""Greece and China share so many similarities. So in my opinion, the horizon for our cooperation and exchanges is vast. There are endless possibilities which have not been explored.""Mutual learning Chinese President Xi Jinping replied to a letter from Virvidakis and four other Greek scholars earlier in 2023, extending congratulations over the founding of the Center of Chinese and Greek Ancient Civilizations.Hailing the long history of the Chinese civilization and profound influence of the ancient Greek civilization, Xi said in the letter that more than 2,000 years ago, the two civilizations shone brightly on the two ends of the Eurasian continent, jointly making a fundamental contribution to the evolution of human civilization.Greece's golden era produced many of its great philosophers and literary giants. The era coincided with a period in China in which ""a hundred schools of thought contended with each other"" and flourished together.As early as the 4th century BC, China was known to the Greeks by a beautiful name: Sērikḗ. In the 16th century, Euclid's Elements was introduced into China, paving the way for scientific exchanges between China and the West. The story of Prometheus narrated by Aeschylus was an inspiration to many Chinese revolutionaries. The Republic by Plato and Politics by Aristotle are also among the Greek classics known to have long made a name for themselves in China.In the eyes of Virvidakis, Chinese civilization has always been a culture that attracts people though the language is difficult. However, Chinese art, Chinese painting, Chinese poetry, especially love poems, even detective stories about China, are incredibly fascinating. Chinese director Zhang Yimou, and movies like Farewell My Concubine and Raise the Red Lantern starring Gong Li, are also very popular. Greek archaeologists who are interested in Chinese archeology want to know how China explores the past.In other art forms, the mythology and theater, ""we have tragedy, which is our own tradition. You have Chinese opera with music."" Actors and artists always want to study similarities and look at the differences, which is also the commitment of the center to promoting exchanges and mutual learning between the two civilizations and promoting the development of civilizations in various countries. China also has this appeal because people in the West think ""it's very different, it's exotic, something strange, but then they realize that it's beautiful for them."" So ""they find a lot of aspects that they have not thought about before in order to understand.""

Tiantan, a UNESCO World Heritage Site built in 1420, in Beijing Photo: VCGPhilosophy, a way of life There is a feeling among some people in the West that the Chinese system is different in some ways, said the professor. For instance,the European and American systems place great emphasis on individual rights, but China takes a more holistic approach in which ""harmony, social harmony is more important in sovereign.""""We are not exactly the same and there are also differences. But I don't believe in the so-called clash of civilizations theory that the clash is very deep and we can't live together with our differences,"" he told the Global Times. ""In fact we can live together and have peaceful exchanges. As I said, I don't think there is any danger of Greece threatening China or China occupying Greece.""In February, Virvidakis held a lecture at the center's launching ceremony, titled Philosophy is a Way of Life. Philosophy is not just theory, he said, noting that in ancient Greece and China it didn't mean just making theories about the universe, nature, god, or much of the unknown world. ""It told you how to 'organize' your life to feel happy and achieve harmony with others."" Western philosophy cannot be understood just by itself as there are also Chinese and Indian schools of philosophy among others. ""It is easier to see some similarities in ideas between Confucius and Socrates or Confucius and Aristotle,"" said Virvidakis, explaining why he is so fond of Chinese philosophy, especially Confucius thought. A simple question about what is a good life has a variety of answers in different philosophical theories.  But studying philosophy is practical and a way of life. Modern people don't just derive happiness from materialism. They need art and other emotionally stirring elements in life. In different parts and different cultures of the world,people can share similarities in emotion and sentiment.Virvidakis said that one of the most important reasons for his involving in such studies and exchanges was because ""I'm interested and I want to learn more.

 The first Saudi ambassador to Palestine Naif bin Bandar Al-Sudairi arrived in the West Bank on Tuesday, the official Palestinian news agency WAFA reported.Leading an official delegation, Al-Sudairi, the non-resident ambassador to Palestine and non-resident consul general in Jerusalem, presented his credentials to Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas at the presidency headquarters in Ramallah, it said.Al-Sudairi's arrival comes amid Israel's efforts to normalize relations with Saudi Arabia.During their meeting, Abbas welcomed Al-Sudairi and said his visit to Palestine and his appointment as Saudi ambassador to the State of Palestine would contribute to ""strengthening the strong fraternal relations that bind the two countries and the two brotherly peoples.""The Saudi ambassador said he hoped that his visit would be ""a successful beginning for strengthening relations in all fields,"" stressing his country's firm and supportive positions for the Palestinian people and their just cause.Earlier in the day, Al-Sudairi told reporters in a statement that ""the Arab Peace Initiative is the basic point in any upcoming agreement,"" after being asked about the fate of the initiative in the event of reaching a normalization deal between Saudi Arabia and Israel.The Arab Peace Initiative was launched in 2002 after it was drafted by Saudi Arabia and adopted by the Arab League.The initiative calls for an end to the conflict between Israel and Palestine and the normalization of relations between Israel and Arab states, in exchange for an Israeli withdrawal from the areas it gained since 1967 and proper settlement to the issue of Palestinian refugees.The Palestinians demanded the establishment of an independent state alongside Israel in all of the Palestinian territories occupied by Israel in 1967, including the entire West Bank and the Gaza Strip, with East Jerusalem as its capital.The Saudi ambassador also confirmed that his country intends to open a consulate in East Jerusalem soon.",PHOTO,WORLD,"Saudi ambassador to Palestine Naif bin Bandar Al-Sudairi (Front) arrives at the Palestinian foreign ministry headquarters in the West Bank city of Ramallah, on Sept. 26, 2023.(Photo: Xinhua)",Author details not found,Author details not found,12,313,<FreqDist with 15 samples and 181 outcomes>
China releases a white paper on its proposals and actions on building a global community of shared future,GT staff reporters,2023-09-26," The Chinese government released a white paper on Tuesday to introduce the theoretical base, practice and development of a global community of shared future, as by presenting China's vision of the course of human development, it counters the hegemonic thinking of certain countries that seek supremacy. The white paper, titled ""A Global Community of Shared Future: China's Proposals and Actions,"" introduced the background for China to raise the concept of a global community of shared future as the world is undergoing changes on a scale unseen in a century with various problems posing unprecedented challenges for human society. The zero-sum game is doomed to fail, the white paper said. But certain countries still cling to this mindset, blindly pursuing absolute security and monopolistic advantages, which will do nothing for their development in the long run but create a major threat to the world. It is increasingly obvious that the obsession with superior strength, and the zero-sum mentality are in conflict with the needs of our times, the white paper said, pointing out that the new era calls for new ideas. To build a global community of shared future is to pursue openness, inclusiveness, mutual benefit, equity and justice, the white paper said. The goal is not to replace one system or civilization with another. Instead, it is about countries with different social systems, ideologies, histories, shared rights, and shared responsibilities in global affairs. The vision of a global community of shared future stands on the right side of history and on the side of human progress. It introduces a new approach for international relations, provides new ideas for global governance, opens up new prospects for international exchanges and draws a new blueprint for a better world, according to the white paper. Such important vision transcends outdated mindsets such as zero-sum game, power politics, and Cold War confrontations. It has become the overall goal of China's major-country diplomacy in the new era, and a great banner that leads the trend of the times and the direction of human progress. The concept of a global community of shared future has deep roots in China's profound cultural heritage and its unique experience of modernization. It carries forward the diplomatic traditions of China and draws on the outstanding achievements of all other civilizations, the white paper said. It also manifests China's time-honored historical traditions, distinct characteristics of the times, and a wealth of humanistic values.  The white paper also pointed out the direction and plan to build a global community of shared future including pressing ahead with a new type of economic globalization in which countries need to pursue a policy of openness and explicitly oppose protectionism, the erection of fences and barriers, unilateral sanctions, and maximum-pressure tactics, so as to connect economies and jointly build an open world economy. Some countries are seeking to decouple from China, enclosing themselves in ""small yards, high fences,"" which will ultimately only backfire, the white paper said. Also, some people overstate the need to ""reduce dependence"" and ""de-risk,"" which is essentially creating new risks. The direction and the plan also include following a peaceful development plan, fostering a new type of international relations, practicing true multilateralism and promoting the common values of humanity. Over the past decade, China has contributed its strength to building a global community of shared future with firm conviction and solid actions. For instance, by July 2023, more than three-quarters of countries in the world and over 30 international organizations had signed agreements on Belt and Road cooperation with China. The BRI originated in China but the opportunities and achievements it creates belong to the whole world. It's an initiative for economic cooperation, not for geopolitical or military alliances, and it's open and inclusive process that neither targets nor excludes any party, the white paper said. Among those BRI projects, for example, the China-Laos Railway began operation on December 3, 2021, with 167 tunnels and 301 bridges built in 11 years along its total length of 1,035 kilometers. The railway construction created more than 110,000 local jobs, and helped build about 2,000 kilometers of roads and canals for villages along the railway, benefiting local people. Besides the BRI, the Global Development Initiative, the Global Security Initiative and Global Civilization Initiative have evolved into a crucial cornerstone for building a global community of shared future, offering China's solutions to major challenges pertaining to peace and development for humanity. Facing constant flare-ups of hotspot issues, China has been committed to fulfilling its role as a responsible major country, pushing for the resolution of international and regional flashpoints, such as the Korean Peninsula, Palestine, the Iranian nuclear issue, Syria and Afghanistan, the white paper said. On the Ukraine issue, China has actively promoted talks for peace, put forth four points, four things that the international community should do together and three observations, and released China's position on the political settlement of the Ukraine crisis and has dispatched the special representative of the Chinese government on Eurasian affairs to engage in extensive interactions and exchanges with stakeholders on the political settlement of the Ukraine crisis. Also, through the mediation of China, Saudi Arabia and Iran achieve historic reconciliation earlier this year, setting a fine example for countries in the region to resolve disputes and differences and achieve good neighborly relations through dialogue and consultation, and catalyzing a wave of reconciliation in the Middle East. China has also proposed a range of regional and bilateral initiatives on building communities of shared future and working with stakeholders to build consensus and expand cooperation, there by playing a constructive role in promoting regional peace and development. It also boosts international cooperation in fields including fighting the COVID-19 pandemic, addressing disorder in cyberspace governance and dealing with the global climate challenge. Over the past decade, the vision of a global community of shared future has gained broader support. More countries and people have come to the understanding that this vision serves the common interests of humanity, represents popular calls for peace, justice and progress, and can create the greatest synergy among all nations for building a better world, the white paper said.",CHINA,POLITICS,Photo: Li Xuanmin/GT,Author details not found,Author details not found,33,1000,<FreqDist with 17 samples and 603 outcomes>

F-35: Closer Look at Colossally Costly Jet That Just Can’t Seem to Stay Airborne,Sputnik,2023-09-21,"A US Marine Corps F-35B went down over South Carolina on Sunday after its pilot ejected mid-flight for reasons unknown. Why do F-35s seem so crash-prone? What’s wrong with them? And what role does the waste and fraud in the US military-industrial complex play in creating such a Frankenstein’s monster of an aircraft? Sputnik explores.Debris from the F-35B that went missing over South Carolina on September 17 was found in Williamsburg County, South Carolina, about two hours northeast of Joint Base Charleston on Monday following more than a day of frantic searching by the military. An as yet unspecified “mishap” was blamed for the accident. The pilot escaped unscathed.“The mishap is currently under investigation, and we are unable to provide additional details to preserve the integrity of the investigative process,” the Marine Corps said in a statement Monday. The Marines ordered a two-day global pause in all aerial operations, with the errant F-35B becoming the third major aviation-related accident suffered by the military branch in less than two months.Air units will be discussing “fundamentals of safe flight operations, ground safety, maintenance and flight procedures, and maintaining combat readiness,” the Marine Corps said.How Many F-35s Have Been Lost?Since it started being introduced into service with the Marines (2015), the US Air Force (2016), and the US Navy (2019) and began to be exported to foreign clients (starting with Israel in 2018), the F-35 has gained an unenviable reputation of being a costly, buggy, and crash-prone jet, with the F-35B that went down over South Carolina last week being at least the 11th Lightning II lost since 2018.On September 28, 2018, a US Marine Corps F-35B crashed during a flight near Marine Corps Air Station Beaufort in South Carolina, with a faulty fuel tube blamed for the incident. The pilot emerged unscathed.On April 9, 2019, a Japanese Self- Defense Force F-35A went down off Honshu, Japan. The pilot was killed after losing his bearings and suffering “special disorientation” mid-flight over the ocean.On May 19, 2020, a US Air Force F-35A from the 58th Fighter Squadron crashed while performing a landing at Eglin Air Force Base in western Florida. Pilot error (trying to land at excessive speed) and a mechanical defect related to a flight control glitch that left the plane’s tail unresponsive were blamed. The pilot survived.On September 29, 2020, a US Marine Corps F-35B was lost over Imperial County, California after colliding with a KC-130 tanker during midflight refueling. The tanker crew managed to bring their aircraft down for a hard landing. The F-35 pilot ejected successfully.On November 17, 2021, a British Royal Air Force F-35B plunged into the Mediterranean Sea after its pilot ejected during routine operations. That crash was ultimately blamed on a protective cover getting wedged into the plane’s engine intake.On January 4, 2022, a South Korean Air Force F-35A suffering from issues with its onboard avionics carried out an emergency belly landing. Investigators blamed a bird striking the warplane’s landing gear mid-flight. The pilot emerged unharmed.On January 24, 2022, a US Navy F-35C plunged into the South China Sea after making a hard landing on the USS Carl Vinson super carrier. The pilot and six sailors on the deck of the aircraft carrier were injured. A Navy investigation attributed the incident to pilot error.On October 19, 2022, another F-35, this one from the US Air Force, crashed at Hill Air Force Base in Utah during a training mission. The pilot ejected safely. It was later determined that turbulent air somehow confused the jet’s onboard avionics to the point where the aircraft became uncontrollable.On December 1, 2022, a Marine Corps F-35B collapsed on a military base in Japan after suffering a landing gear failure during training. No one was injured.Finally, on December 15, 2022, a US Navy F-35B crashed while attempting to perform a vertical landing at Naval Air Station Joint Reserve Base Fort Worth in Texas during testing of the jet’s systems. A “harmonic resonance” issue related to the jet’s Pratt & Whitney F135 engine was blamed, with the Pentagon halting further F-35 deliveries by Lockheed until an investigation was concluded.What’s Wrong With the F-35?Nearly 17 years after the F-35’s first flight, and eight years after its adoption into service, the F-35 continues to maintain a troublingly long list of technical bugs affecting both hardware and software. The aircraft, which has an astronomical total estimated purchase and sustainment price tag of over $1.7 trillion, and a per-plane cost of $70-$90 million, has faced years of harsh criticism from US officials, including former President Donald Trump at one point, who said the jet’s costs had spiraled “out of control.”At its heart, the F-35 is the product of an idea that metastasized in the Pentagon after the end of the Cold War, envisioning an all-in-one fighter platform which could be used by every branch of the military, equipped with vertical take-off and landing capability, and carry out a broad array of missions using a variety of onboard weapons. The do-it-all jet was supposed to replace nearly all of America’s fourth-gen fighter, strike, and ground attack aircraft, including the F-16 Falcon, the F/A-18 Hornet and Super Hornet, the AV-8B Harrier II, and others.The jet features just a single onboard engine – the aforementioned Pratt & Whitney F135, with engine-related troubles not only regularly referred to by watchdogs as a “leading driver” of the F-35’s problems remaining “mission capable,” but also making its operation over enemy territory or over the sea risky, since if something goes wrong, the plane doesn’t have a backup engine to limp home with.Throughout its production cycle, the F-35 Lightning II has suffered a dizzying and seemingly endless list of technical problems, from neck-snapping ejection seats to problems, ironically, while operating in stormy weather.In its 2023 report, the congressional Government Accountability Office revealed that the F-35 program “continues to experience schedule delays, cost growth, and late deliveries,” with procurement costs jumping by $13.4 billion since 2019, and modernization behind schedule and over budget.“As of January 2023, of the 821 open deficiencies, the program office characterized five of these as category 1 [i.e. critical issues which could jeopardize flight safety and security], and 816 as category 2, [i.e. those which could impede or constrain mission success].”In all, between December 2006 and 2023, the GAO has reported a whopping 277 category 1 and 2,467 category 2 deficiencies with the aircraft, among them serious issues like cabin over-pressurization, problems with the jets’ night vision systems, software bugs, radar issues, corrosion, ejection seats which could snap pilots’ necks, etc.Is a Culture of Largess to Blame?Sunday’s accident in South Carolina is the latest piece of F-35-related bad news for Lockheed Martin. In June, it was reported that the Pentagon had halted the delivery of any additional upgraded F-35s until major issues related to new Technology Refresh 3 (TR-3) hardware and weapons-related software were resolved. DoD F-35 program director Mike Schmidt told Congress in March that the risk assessment related to the TR-3 hardware upgrade wouldn’t be finished until April 2024.Despite the delays and array of technical problems, the weapons giant has continued to rack up generous contracts related to F-35 procurement and production. For example, in July, the US Navy ordered a $490 million package of equipment from Lockheed “to procure various material mod kits, special test/tooling equipment, as well as…product engineering” for already delivered, but defective planes. In August, Lockheed received another $606 million “fixed-price incentive (firm-target) undefinitized” contract “for long lead time materials, parts, components, and efforts to support of maintaining on-time production and delivery of 173 Lot 19 F-35 Joint Strike Fighter aircraft for Foreign Military Sales (FMS) customers and non-US Department of Defense (DOD) participants.”The terms of the contracts seem to be the culprit behind the F-35’s soaring costs (and Lockheed’s soaring profits, despite delivery of defective products), with so-called “cost-plus” and “undefinitized” contracts effectively making any overruns the buyer’s problem – i.e. that of US taxpayers, and of citizens of any country unfortunate enough to pen contracts for the planes from Lockheed.What About America’s Competitors?The worst part about the F-35’s troublesome history seems to be that the F-35 has already become ""obsolete"" in the sense that many of the US and NATO’s competitors have obtained the ability to defeat them, with Russia and China gaining capabilities to track and target the jets going back to the mid-to-late 2010s. In April, Iran announced that its engineers had created advanced radar technologies to not only detect F-35s, but identify the radar signature of individual F-35 planes, enabling the Islamic Republic to plan defensive operations accordingly.",WORLD,AMERICAS,Picture description not found,Author details not found,Author details not found,60,1305,<FreqDist with 18 samples and 775 outcomes>
Toxic explosion in Nebraska shows US unable to take issues affecting public security seriously: experts,Xu Yelu,2023-09-15,"Barely two months after an explosion in Louisiana, a train carrying toxic perchloric acid has exploded in a Nebraska rail yard on Thursday, prompting evacuation orders to be issued, as huge plumes are seen engulfing the city. Experts said the incident shows the US has been unable to take seriously and overcome major issues affecting public safety and the environment and ecology in the country.The incident happened on Union Pacific Railroad tracks in the city of North Platte. North Platte Volunteer Fire Department announced that they would order those living in the area to evacuate due to the toxic smoke from the railroad, according to media reports.In a post on social media platforms, it said that ""Emergency evacuation for the area between splinter and front North of railroad track due fire at the railroad involving heavy toxic smoke.""In a statement to DailyMail.com, Union Pacific Railroad said that an explosion occurred inside a container which resulted in several railcars catching fire. The railcar did not derail, the company said, and had been in the yard for several hours.Union Pacific said that one of the containers contained a hazardous chemical called perchloric acid, according to Daily Mail.Perchloric is a hazardous material used in food, drugs and biocidal products, as well as explosives, according to the report.Two months ago, a fire at a Louisiana chemical plant triggered explosions that shook homes several miles away and sent flames and smoke billowing into the air in mid-July, prompting emergency officials to urge a few hundred nearby residents to shelter indoors for several hours and to turn off their air conditioners, the Associated Press reported.Antiquated infrastructure and the outdated transportation were one factor. Another was a flawed system of governance in the US transport industry, experts noted. There is no doubt that the US has serious loopholes in the transportation management of hazardous substances, and the relevant error correction mechanism is in fact not effective, which means that this kind of thing will occur in the future, Li Haidong, a professor at the China Foreign Affairs University, told the Global Times on Friday.This shows that the US has been unable to take seriously and overcome serious and major issues affecting public safety and the environment and ecology in the country, Li said. ""It must be said that this is a great irony to the self-proclaimed internal governance of the most advanced country in the world.""Analysts said that the frequent occurrence of similar incidents shows that the error correction mechanism in the US has failed. Apart from this, racism and the proliferation of guns are also clear examples of the failure of error correction mechanisms, experts noted.",WORLD,AMERICAS,"A resident of East Palestine in the state of Ohio, US, angrily points during a town hall meeting held by the US

Greek scholar believes in ‘endless possibilities and vast land’ between China-Greece exchanges,Xu Liuliu,2023-09-14,"Chongqing, Sichuan, Shandong… Stelios Virvidakis expectantly plans his next China tour before a visit by the Global Times at his office in Athens, Greece. The University of Athens professor has grown far busier recently since he and four other Greek scholars launched the Center of Chinese and Greek Ancient Civilizations in February. Over the summer, the center has received two scholars from China who have given lectures on the history of China, and other visiting guests from places like Israel, who offered their views on Chinese medicine and its history, and a lecturer from France with insights in Chinese mathematics and how scholars in ancient China studied the living science.""Students found them to be very interesting and greatly appreciated the lectures,"" Virvidakis told the Global Times. ""Greece and China share so many similarities. So in my opinion, the horizon for our cooperation and exchanges is vast. There are endless possibilities which have not been explored.""Mutual learning Chinese President Xi Jinping replied to a letter from Virvidakis and four other Greek scholars earlier in 2023, extending congratulations over the founding of the Center of Chinese and Greek Ancient Civilizations.Hailing the long history of the Chinese civilization and profound influence of the ancient Greek civilization, Xi said in the letter that more than 2,000 years ago, the two civilizations shone brightly on the two ends of the Eurasian continent, jointly making a fundamental contribution to the evolution of human civilization.Greece's golden era produced many of its great philosophers and literary giants. The era coincided with a period in China in which ""a hundred schools of thought contended with each other"" and flourished together.As early as the 4th century BC, China was known to the Greeks by a beautiful name: Sērikḗ. In the 16th century, Euclid's Elements was introduced into China, paving the way for scientific exchanges between China and the West. The story of Prometheus narrated by Aeschylus was an inspiration to many Chinese revolutionaries. The Republic by Plato and Politics by Aristotle are also among the Greek classics known to have long made a name for themselves in China.In the eyes of Virvidakis, Chinese civilization has always been a culture that attracts people though the language is difficult. However, Chinese art, Chinese painting, Chinese poetry, especially love poems, even detective stories about China, are incredibly fascinating. Chinese director Zhang Yimou, and movies like Farewell My Concubine and Raise the Red Lantern starring Gong Li, are also very popular. Greek archaeologists who are interested in Chinese archeology want to know how China explores the past.In other art forms, the mythology and theater, ""we have tragedy, which is our own tradition. You have Chinese opera with music."" Actors and artists always want to study similarities and look at the differences, which is also the commitment of the center to promoting exchanges and mutual learning between the two civilizations and promoting the development of civilizations in various countries. China also has this appeal because people in the West think ""it's very different, it's exotic, something strange, but then they realize that it's beautiful for them."" So ""they find a lot of aspects that they have not thought about before in order to understand.""

Tiantan, a UNESCO World Heritage Site built in 1420, in Beijing Photo: VCGPhilosophy, a way of life There is a feeling among some people in the West that the Chinese system is different in some ways, said the professor. For instance,the European and American systems place great emphasis on individual rights, but China takes a more holistic approach in which ""harmony, social harmony is more important in sovereign.""""We are not exactly the same and there are also differences. But I don't believe in the so-called clash of civilizations theory that the clash is very deep and we can't live together with our differences,"" he told the Global Times. ""In fact we can live together and have peaceful exchanges. As I said, I don't think there is any danger of Greece threatening China or China occupying Greece.""In February, Virvidakis held a lecture at the center's launching ceremony, titled Philosophy is a Way of Life. Philosophy is not just theory, he said, noting that in ancient Greece and China it didn't mean just making theories about the universe, nature, god, or much of the unknown world. ""It told you how to 'organize' your life to feel happy and achieve harmony with others."" Western philosophy cannot be understood just by itself as there are also Chinese and Indian schools of philosophy among others. ""It is easier to see some similarities in ideas between Confucius and Socrates or Confucius and Aristotle,"" said Virvidakis, explaining why he is so fond of Chinese philosophy, especially Confucius thought. A simple question about what is a good life has a variety of answers in different philosophical theories.  But studying philosophy is practical and a way of life. Modern people don't just derive happiness from materialism. They need art and other emotionally stirring elements in life.

 The first Saudi ambassador to Palestine Naif bin Bandar Al-Sudairi arrived in the West Bank on Tuesday, the official Palestinian news agency WAFA reported.Leading an official delegation, Al-Sudairi, the non-resident ambassador to Palestine and non-resident consul general in Jerusalem, presented his credentials to Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas at the presidency headquarters in Ramallah, it said.Al-Sudairi's arrival comes amid Israel's efforts to normalize relations with Saudi Arabia.During their meeting, Abbas welcomed Al-Sudairi and said his visit to Palestine and his appointment as Saudi ambassador to the State of Palestine would contribute to ""strengthening the strong fraternal relations that bind the two countries and the two brotherly peoples.""The Saudi ambassador said he hoped that his visit would be ""a successful beginning for strengthening relations in all fields,"" stressing his country's firm and supportive positions for the Palestinian people and their just cause.Earlier in the day, Al-Sudairi told reporters in a statement that ""the Arab Peace Initiative is the basic point in any upcoming agreement,"" after being asked about the fate of the initiative in the event of reaching a normalization deal between Saudi Arabia and Israel.The Arab Peace Initiative was launched in 2002 after it was drafted by Saudi Arabia and adopted by the Arab League.The initiative calls for an end to the conflict between Israel and Palestine and the normalization of relations between Israel and Arab states, in exchange for an Israeli withdrawal from the areas it gained since 1967 and proper settlement to the issue of Palestinian refugees.The Palestinians demanded the establishment of an independent state alongside Israel in all of the Palestinian territories occupied by Israel in 1967, including the entire West Bank and the Gaza Strip, with East Jerusalem as its capital.The Saudi ambassador also confirmed that his country intends to open a consulate in East Jerusalem soon.",PHOTO,WORLD,"Saudi ambassador to Palestine Naif bin Bandar Al-Sudairi (Front) arrives at the Palestinian foreign ministry headquarters in the West Bank city of Ramallah, on Sept. 26, 2023.(Photo: Xinhua)",Author details not found,Author details not found,12,313,<FreqDist with 15 samples and 181 outcomes>
China releases a white paper on its proposals and actions on building a global community of shared future,GT staff reporters,2023-09-26," The Chinese government released a white paper on Tuesday to introduce the theoretical base, practice and development of a global community of shared future, as by presenting China's vision of the course of human development, it counters the hegemonic thinking of certain countries that seek supremacy. The white paper, titled ""A Global Community of Shared Future: China's Proposals and Actions,"" introduced the background for China to raise the concept of a global community of shared future as the world is undergoing changes on a scale unseen in a century with various problems posing unprecedented challenges for human society. The zero-sum game is doomed to fail, the white paper said. But certain countries still cling to this mindset, blindly pursuing absolute security and monopolistic advantages, which will do nothing for their development in the long run but create a major threat to the world. It is increasingly obvious that the obsession with superior strength, and the zero-sum mentality are in conflict with the needs of our times, the white paper said, pointing out that the new era calls for new ideas. To build a global community of shared future is to pursue openness, inclusiveness, mutual benefit, equity and justice, the white paper said. The goal is not to replace one system or civilization with another. Instead, it is about countries with different social systems, ideologies, histories, shared rights, and shared responsibilities in global affairs. The vision of a global community of shared future stands on the right side of history and on the side of human progress. It introduces a new approach for international relations, provides new ideas for global governance, opens up new prospects for international exchanges and draws a new blueprint for a better world, according to the white paper. Such important vision transcends outdated mindsets such as zero-sum game, power politics, and Cold War confrontations. It has become the overall goal of China's major-country diplomacy in the new era, and a great banner that leads the trend of the times and the direction of human progress. The concept of a global community of shared future has deep roots in China's profound cultural heritage and its unique experience of modernization. It carries forward the diplomatic traditions of China and draws on the outstanding achievements of all other civilizations, the white paper said. It also manifests China's time-honored historical traditions, distinct characteristics of the times, and a wealth of humanistic values.  The white paper also pointed out the direction and plan to build a global community of shared future including pressing ahead with a new type of economic globalization in which countries need to pursue a policy of openness and explicitly oppose protectionism, the erection of fences and barriers, unilateral sanctions, and maximum-pressure tactics, so as to connect economies and jointly build an open world economy. Some countries are seeking to decouple from China, enclosing themselves in ""small yards, high fences,"" which will ultimately only backfire, the white paper said. Also, some people overstate the need to ""reduce dependence"" and ""de-risk,"" which is essentially creating new risks. The direction and the plan also include following a peaceful development plan, fostering a new type of international relations, practicing true multilateralism and promoting the common values of humanity. Over the past decade, China has contributed its strength to building a global community of shared future with firm conviction and solid actions. For instance, by July 2023, more than three-quarters of countries in the world and over 30 international organizations had signed agreements on Belt and Road cooperation with China. The BRI originated in China but the opportunities and achievements it creates belong to the whole world. It's an initiative for economic cooperation, not for geopolitical or military alliances, and it's open and inclusive process that neither targets nor excludes any party, the white paper said. Among those BRI projects, for example, the China-Laos Railway began operation on December 3, 2021, with 167 tunnels and 301 bridges built in 11 years along its total length of 1,035 kilometers. The railway construction created more than 110,000 local jobs, and helped build about 2,000 kilometers of roads and canals for villages along the railway, benefiting local people. Besides the BRI, the Global Development Initiative, the Global Security Initiative and Global Civilization Initiative have evolved into a crucial cornerstone for building a global community of shared future, offering China's solutions to major challenges pertaining to peace and development for humanity. Facing constant flare-ups of hotspot issues, China has been committed to fulfilling its role as a responsible major country, pushing for the resolution of international and regional flashpoints, such as the Korean Peninsula, Palestine, the Iranian nuclear issue, Syria and Afghanistan, the white paper said. On the Ukraine issue, China has actively promoted talks for peace, put forth four points, four things that the international community should do together and three observations, and released China's position on the political settlement of the Ukraine crisis and has dispatched the special representative of the Chinese government on Eurasian affairs to engage in extensive interactions and exchanges with stakeholders on the political settlement of the Ukraine crisis. Also, through the mediation of China, Saudi Arabia and Iran achieve historic reconciliation earlier this year, setting a fine example for countries in the region to resolve disputes and differences and achieve good neighborly relations through dialogue and consultation, and catalyzing a wave of reconciliation in the Middle East. China has also proposed a range of regional and bilateral initiatives on building communities of shared future and working with stakeholders to build consensus and expand cooperation, there by playing a constructive role in promoting regional peace and development. It also boosts international cooperation in fields including fighting the COVID-19 pandemic, addressing disorder in cyberspace governance and dealing with the global climate challenge. Over the past decade, the vision of a global community of shared future has gained broader support. More countries and people have come to the understanding that this vision serves the common interests of humanity, represents popular calls for peace, justice and progress, and can create the greatest synergy among all nations for building a better world, the white paper said.",CHINA,POLITICS,Photo: Li Xuanmin/GT,Author details not found,Author details not found,33,1000,<FreqDist with 17 samples and 603 outcomes>

F-35: Closer Look at Colossally Costly Jet That Just Can’t Seem to Stay Airborne,Sputnik,2023-09-21,"A US Marine Corps F-35B went down over South Carolina on Sunday after its pilot ejected mid-flight for reasons unknown. Why do F-35s seem so crash-prone? What’s wrong with them? And what role does the waste and fraud in the US military-industrial complex play in creating such a Frankenstein’s monster of an aircraft? Sputnik explores.Debris from the F-35B that went missing over South Carolina on September 17 was found in Williamsburg County, South Carolina, about two hours northeast of Joint Base Charleston on Monday following more than a day of frantic searching by the military. An as yet unspecified “mishap” was blamed for the accident. The pilot escaped unscathed.“The mishap is currently under investigation, and we are unable to provide additional details to preserve the integrity of the investigative process,” the Marine Corps said in a statement Monday. The Marines ordered a two-day global pause in all aerial operations, with the errant F-35B becoming the third major aviation-related accident suffered by the military branch in less than two months.Air units will be discussing “fundamentals of safe flight operations, ground safety, maintenance and flight procedures, and maintaining combat readiness,” the Marine Corps said.How Many F-35s Have Been Lost?Since it started being introduced into service with the Marines (2015), the US Air Force (2016), and the US Navy (2019) and began to be exported to foreign clients (starting with Israel in 2018), the F-35 has gained an unenviable reputation of being a costly, buggy, and crash-prone jet, with the F-35B that went down over South Carolina last week being at least the 11th Lightning II lost since 2018.On September 28, 2018, a US Marine Corps F-35B crashed during a flight near Marine Corps Air Station Beaufort in South Carolina, with a faulty fuel tube blamed for the incident. The pilot emerged unscathed.On April 9, 2019, a Japanese Self- Defense Force F-35A went down off Honshu, Japan. The pilot was killed after losing his bearings and suffering “special disorientation” mid-flight over the ocean.On May 19, 2020, a US Air Force F-35A from the 58th Fighter Squadron crashed while performing a landing at Eglin Air Force Base in western Florida. Pilot error (trying to land at excessive speed) and a mechanical defect related to a flight control glitch that left the plane’s tail unresponsive were blamed. The pilot survived.On September 29, 2020, a US Marine Corps F-35B was lost over Imperial County, California after colliding with a KC-130 tanker during midflight refueling. The tanker crew managed to bring their aircraft down for a hard landing. The F-35 pilot ejected successfully.On November 17, 2021, a British Royal Air Force F-35B plunged into the Mediterranean Sea after its pilot ejected during routine operations. That crash was ultimately blamed on a protective cover getting wedged into the plane’s engine intake.On January 4, 2022, a South Korean Air Force F-35A suffering from issues with its onboard avionics carried out an emergency belly landing. Investigators blamed a bird striking the warplane’s landing gear mid-flight. The pilot emerged unharmed.On January 24, 2022, a US Navy F-35C plunged into the South China Sea after making a hard landing on the USS Carl Vinson super carrier. The pilot and six sailors on the deck of the aircraft carrier were injured. A Navy investigation attributed the incident to pilot error.On October 19, 2022, another F-35, this one from the US Air Force, crashed at Hill Air Force Base in Utah during a training mission. The pilot ejected safely. It was later determined that turbulent air somehow confused the jet’s onboard avionics to the point where the aircraft became uncontrollable.On December 1, 2022, a Marine Corps F-35B collapsed on a military base in Japan after suffering a landing gear failure during training. No one was injured.Finally, on December 15, 2022, a US Navy F-35B crashed while attempting to perform a vertical landing at Naval Air Station Joint Reserve Base Fort Worth in Texas during testing of the jet’s systems. A “harmonic resonance” issue related to the jet’s Pratt & Whitney F135 engine was blamed, with the Pentagon halting further F-35 deliveries by Lockheed until an investigation was concluded.What’s Wrong With the F-35?Nearly 17 years after the F-35’s first flight, and eight years after its adoption into service, the F-35 continues to maintain a troublingly long list of technical bugs affecting both hardware and software. The aircraft, which has an astronomical total estimated purchase and sustainment price tag of over $1.7 trillion, and a per-plane cost of $70-$90 million, has faced years of harsh criticism from US officials, including former President Donald Trump at one point, who said the jet’s costs had spiraled “out of control.”At its heart, the F-35 is the product of an idea that metastasized in the Pentagon after the end of the Cold War, envisioning an all-in-one fighter platform which could be used by every branch of the military, equipped with vertical take-off and landing capability, and carry out a broad array of missions using a variety of onboard weapons. The do-it-all jet was supposed to replace nearly all of America’s fourth-gen fighter, strike, and ground attack aircraft, including the F-16 Falcon, the F/A-18 Hornet and Super Hornet, the AV-8B Harrier II, and others.The jet features just a single onboard engine – the aforementioned Pratt & Whitney F135, with engine-related troubles not only regularly referred to by watchdogs as a “leading driver” of the F-35’s problems remaining “mission capable,” but also making its operation over enemy territory or over the sea risky, since if something goes wrong, the plane doesn’t have a backup engine to limp home with.Throughout its production cycle, the F-35 Lightning II has suffered a dizzying and seemingly endless list of technical problems, from neck-snapping ejection seats to problems, ironically, while operating in stormy weather.In its 2023 report, the congressional Government Accountability Office revealed that the F-35 program “continues to experience schedule delays, cost growth, and late deliveries,” with procurement costs jumping by $13.4 billion since 2019, and modernization behind schedule and over budget.“As of January 2023, of the 821 open deficiencies, the program office characterized five of these as category 1 [i.e. critical issues which could jeopardize flight safety and security], and 816 as category 2, [i.e. those which could impede or constrain mission success].”In all, between December 2006 and 2023, the GAO has reported a whopping 277 category 1 and 2,467 category 2 deficiencies with the aircraft, among them serious issues like cabin over-pressurization, problems with the jets’ night vision systems, software bugs, radar issues, corrosion, ejection seats which could snap pilots’ necks, etc.Is a Culture of Largess to Blame?Sunday’s accident in South Carolina is the latest piece of F-35-related bad news for Lockheed Martin. In June, it was reported that the Pentagon had halted the delivery of any additional upgraded F-35s until major issues related to new Technology Refresh 3 (TR-3) hardware and weapons-related software were resolved. DoD F-35 program director Mike Schmidt told Congress in March that the risk assessment related to the TR-3 hardware upgrade wouldn’t be finished until April 2024.Despite the delays and array of technical problems, the weapons giant has continued to rack up generous contracts related to F-35 procurement and production. For example, in July, the US Navy ordered a $490 million package of equipment from Lockheed “to procure various material mod kits, special test/tooling equipment, as well as…product engineering” for already delivered, but defective planes. In August, Lockheed received another $606 million “fixed-price incentive (firm-target) undefinitized” contract “for long lead time materials, parts, components, and efforts to support of maintaining on-time production and delivery of 173 Lot 19 F-35 Joint Strike Fighter aircraft for Foreign Military Sales (FMS) customers and non-US Department of Defense (DOD) participants.”The terms of the contracts seem to be the culprit behind the F-35’s soaring costs (and Lockheed’s soaring profits, despite delivery of defective products), with so-called “cost-plus” and “undefinitized” contracts effectively making any overruns the buyer’s problem – i.e. that of US taxpayers, and of citizens of any country unfortunate enough to pen contracts for the planes from Lockheed.What About America’s Competitors?The worst part about the F-35’s troublesome history seems to be that the F-35 has already become ""obsolete"" in the sense that many of the US and NATO’s competitors have obtained the ability to defeat them, with Russia and China gaining capabilities to track and target the jets going back to the mid-to-late 2010s. In April, Iran announced that its engineers had created advanced radar technologies to not only detect F-35s, but identify the radar signature of individual F-35 planes, enabling the Islamic Republic to plan defensive operations accordingly.",WORLD,AMERICAS,Picture description not found,Author details not found,Author details not found,60,1305,<FreqDist with 18 samples and 775 outcomes>
Toxic explosion in Nebraska shows US unable to take issues affecting public security seriously: experts,Xu Yelu,2023-09-15,"Barely two months after an explosion in Louisiana, a train carrying toxic perchloric acid has exploded in a Nebraska rail yard on Thursday, prompting evacuation orders to be issued, as huge plumes are seen engulfing the city. Experts said the incident shows the US has been unable to take seriously and overcome major issues affecting public safety and the environment and ecology in the country.The incident happened on Union Pacific Railroad tracks in the city of North Platte. North Platte Volunteer Fire Department announced that they would order those living in the area to evacuate due to the toxic smoke from the railroad, according to media reports.In a post on social media platforms, it said that ""Emergency evacuation for the area between splinter and front North of railroad track due fire at the railroad involving heavy toxic smoke.""In a statement to DailyMail.com, Union Pacific Railroad said that an explosion occurred inside a container which resulted in several railcars catching fire. The railcar did not derail, the company said, and had been in the yard for several hours.Union Pacific said that one of the containers contained a hazardous chemical called perchloric acid, according to Daily Mail.Perchloric is a hazardous material used in food, drugs and biocidal products, as well as explosives, according to the report.Two months ago, a fire at a Louisiana chemical plant triggered explosions that shook homes several miles away and sent flames and smoke billowing into the air in mid-July, prompting emergency officials to urge a few hundred nearby residents to shelter indoors for several hours and to turn off their air conditioners, the Associated Press reported.Antiquated infrastructure and the outdated transportation were one factor. Another was a flawed system of governance in the US transport industry, experts noted. There is no doubt that the US has serious loopholes in the transportation management of hazardous substances, and the relevant error correction mechanism is in fact not effective, which means that this kind of thing will occur in the future, Li Haidong, a professor at the China Foreign Affairs University, told the Global Times on Friday.This shows that the US has been unable to take seriously and overcome serious and major issues affecting public safety and the environment and ecology in the country, Li said. ""It must be said that this is a great irony to the self-proclaimed internal governance of the most advanced country in the world.""Analysts said that the frequent occurrence of similar incidents shows that the error correction mechanism in the US has failed. Apart from this, racism and the proliferation of guns are also clear examples of the failure of error correction mechanisms, experts noted.",WORLD,AMERICAS,"A resident of East Palestine in the state of Ohio, US, angrily points during a town hall meeting held by the US

Greek scholar believes in ‘endless possibilities and vast land’ between China-Greece exchanges,Xu Liuliu,2023-09-14,"Chongqing, Sichuan, Shandong… Stelios Virvidakis expectantly plans his next China tour before a visit by the Global Times at his office in Athens, Greece. The University of Athens professor has grown far busier recently since he and four other Greek scholars launched the Center of Chinese and Greek Ancient Civilizations in February. Over the summer, the center has received two scholars from China who have given lectures on the history of China, and other visiting guests from places like Israel, who offered their views on Chinese medicine and its history, and a lecturer from France with insights in Chinese mathematics and how scholars in ancient China studied the living science.""Students found them to be very interesting and greatly appreciated the lectures,"" Virvidakis told the Global Times. ""Greece and China share so many similarities. So in my opinion, the horizon for our cooperation and exchanges is vast. There are endless possibilities which have not been explored.""Mutual learning Chinese President Xi Jinping replied to a letter from Virvidakis and four other Greek scholars earlier in 2023, extending congratulations over the founding of the Center of Chinese and Greek Ancient Civilizations.Hailing the long history of the Chinese civilization and profound influence of the ancient Greek civilization, Xi said in the letter that more than 2,000 years ago, the two civilizations shone brightly on the two ends of the Eurasian continent, jointly making a fundamental contribution to the evolution of human civilization.Greece's golden era produced many of its great philosophers and literary giants. The era coincided with a period in China in which ""a hundred schools of thought contended with each other"" and flourished together.As early as the 4th century BC, China was known to the Greeks by a beautiful name: Sērikḗ. In the 16th century, Euclid's Elements was introduced into China, paving the way for scientific exchanges between China and the West. The story of Prometheus narrated by Aeschylus was an inspiration to many Chinese revolutionaries. The Republic by Plato and Politics by Aristotle are also among the Greek classics known to have long made a name for themselves in China.In the eyes of Virvidakis, Chinese civilization has always been a culture that attracts people though the language is difficult. However, Chinese art, Chinese painting, Chinese poetry, especially love poems, even detective stories about China, are incredibly fascinating. Chinese director Zhang Yimou, and movies like Farewell My Concubine and Raise the Red Lantern starring Gong Li, are also very popular. Greek archaeologists who are interested in Chinese archeology want to know how China explores the past.In other art forms, the mythology and theater, ""we have tragedy, which is our own tradition. You have Chinese opera with music."" Actors and artists always want to study similarities and look at the differences, which is also the commitment of the center to promoting exchanges and mutual learning between the two civilizations and promoting the development of civilizations in various countries. China also has this appeal because people in the West think ""it's very different, it's exotic, something strange, but then they realize that it's beautiful for them."" So ""they find a lot of aspects that they have not thought about before in order to understand.""

Tiantan, a UNESCO World Heritage Site built in 1420, in Beijing Photo: VCGPhilosophy, a way of life There is a feeling among some people in the West that the Chinese system is different in some ways, said the professor. For instance,the European and American systems place great emphasis on individual rights, but China takes a more holistic approach in which ""harmony, social harmony is more important in sovereign.""""We are not exactly the same and there are also differences. But I don't believe in the so-called clash of civilizations theory that the clash is very deep and we can't live together with our differences,"" he told the Global Times. ""In fact we can live together and have peaceful exchanges. As I said, I don't think there is any danger of Greece threatening China or China occupying Greece.""In February, Virvidakis held a lecture at the center's launching ceremony, titled Philosophy is a Way of Life. Philosophy is not just theory, he said, noting that in ancient Greece and China it didn't mean just making theories about the universe, nature, god, or much of the unknown world. ""It told you how to 'organize' your life to feel happy and achieve harmony with others."" Western philosophy cannot be understood just by itself as there are also Chinese and Indian schools of philosophy among others. ""It is easier to see some similarities in ideas between Confucius and Socrates or Confucius and Aristotle,"" said Virvidakis, explaining why he is so fond of Chinese philosophy, especially Confucius thought. A simple question about what is a good life has a variety of answers in different philosophical theories.  But studying philosophy is practical and a way of life. Modern people don't just derive happiness from materialism. They need art and other emotionally stirring elements in life. In different parts and different cultures of the world,people can share similarities in emotion and sentiment.Virvidakis said that one of the most important reasons for his involving in such studies and exchanges was because ""I'm interested and I want to learn more. I'm a student too. When you are a teacher in your whole life, you're going to be a student.""",ARTS,CULTURE & LEISURE,The University of Athens Photo: VCG,"Reporter, Beijing","Global Times senior reporter, mainly covers the reporting of movies, TV, music and culture news.",43,880,<FreqDist with 16 samples and 473 outcomes>

 The first Saudi ambassador to Palestine Naif bin Bandar Al-Sudairi arrived in the West Bank on Tuesday, the official Palestinian news agency WAFA reported.Leading an official delegation, Al-Sudairi, the non-resident ambassador to Palestine and non-resident consul general in Jerusalem, presented his credentials to Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas at the presidency headquarters in Ramallah, it said.Al-Sudairi's arrival comes amid Israel's efforts to normalize relations with Saudi Arabia.During their meeting, Abbas welcomed Al-Sudairi and said his visit to Palestine and his appointment as Saudi ambassador to the State of Palestine would contribute to ""strengthening the strong fraternal relations that bind the two countries and the two brotherly peoples.""The Saudi ambassador said he hoped that his visit would be ""a successful beginning for strengthening relations in all fields,"" stressing his country's firm and supportive positions for the Palestinian people and their just cause.Earlier in the day, Al-Sudairi told reporters in a statement that ""the Arab Peace Initiative is the basic point in any upcoming agreement,"" after being asked about the fate of the initiative in the event of reaching a normalization deal between Saudi Arabia and Israel.The Arab Peace Initiative was launched in 2002 after it was drafted by Saudi Arabia and adopted by the Arab League.The initiative calls for an end to the conflict between Israel and Palestine and the normalization of relations between Israel and Arab states, in exchange for an Israeli withdrawal from the areas it gained since 1967 and proper settlement to the issue of Palestinian refugees.The Palestinians demanded the establishment of an independent state alongside Israel in all of the Palestinian territories occupied by Israel in 1967, including the entire West Bank and the Gaza Strip, with East Jerusalem as its capital.The Saudi ambassador also confirmed that his country intends to open a consulate in East Jerusalem soon.",PHOTO,WORLD,"Saudi ambassador to Palestine Naif bin Bandar Al-Sudairi (Front) arrives at the Palestinian foreign ministry headquarters in the West Bank city of Ramallah, on Sept. 26, 2023.(Photo: Xinhua)",Author details not found,Author details not found,12,313,<FreqDist with 15 samples and 181 outcomes>
China releases a white paper on its proposals and actions on building a global community of shared future,GT staff reporters,2023-09-26," The Chinese government released a white paper on Tuesday to introduce the theoretical base, practice and development of a global community of shared future, as by presenting China's vision of the course of human development, it counters the hegemonic thinking of certain countries that seek supremacy. The white paper, titled ""A Global Community of Shared Future: China's Proposals and Actions,"" introduced the background for China to raise the concept of a global community of shared future as the world is undergoing changes on a scale unseen in a century with various problems posing unprecedented challenges for human society. The zero-sum game is doomed to fail, the white paper said. But certain countries still cling to this mindset, blindly pursuing absolute security and monopolistic advantages, which will do nothing for their development in the long run but create a major threat to the world. It is increasingly obvious that the obsession with superior strength, and the zero-sum mentality are in conflict with the needs of our times, the white paper said, pointing out that the new era calls for new ideas. To build a global community of shared future is to pursue openness, inclusiveness, mutual benefit, equity and justice, the white paper said. The goal is not to replace one system or civilization with another. Instead, it is about countries with different social systems, ideologies, histories, shared rights, and shared responsibilities in global affairs. The vision of a global community of shared future stands on the right side of history and on the side of human progress. It introduces a new approach for international relations, provides new ideas for global governance, opens up new prospects for international exchanges and draws a new blueprint for a better world, according to the white paper. Such important vision transcends outdated mindsets such as zero-sum game, power politics, and Cold War confrontations. It has become the overall goal of China's major-country diplomacy in the new era, and a great banner that leads the trend of the times and the direction of human progress. The concept of a global community of shared future has deep roots in China's profound cultural heritage and its unique experience of modernization. It carries forward the diplomatic traditions of China and draws on the outstanding achievements of all other civilizations, the white paper said. It also manifests China's time-honored historical traditions, distinct characteristics of the times, and a wealth of humanistic values.  The white paper also pointed out the direction and plan to build a global community of shared future including pressing ahead with a new type of economic globalization in which countries need to pursue a policy of openness and explicitly oppose protectionism, the erection of fences and barriers, unilateral sanctions, and maximum-pressure tactics, so as to connect economies and jointly build an open world economy. Some countries are seeking to decouple from China, enclosing themselves in ""small yards, high fences,"" which will ultimately only backfire, the white paper said. Also, some people overstate the need to ""reduce dependence"" and ""de-risk,"" which is essentially creating new risks. The direction and the plan also include following a peaceful development plan, fostering a new type of international relations, practicing true multilateralism and promoting the common values of humanity. Over the past decade, China has contributed its strength to building a global community of shared future with firm conviction and solid actions. For instance, by July 2023, more than three-quarters of countries in the world and over 30 international organizations had signed agreements on Belt and Road cooperation with China. The BRI originated in China but the opportunities and achievements it creates belong to the whole world. It's an initiative for economic cooperation, not for geopolitical or military alliances, and it's open and inclusive process that neither targets nor excludes any party, the white paper said. Among those BRI projects, for example, the China-Laos Railway began operation on December 3, 2021, with 167 tunnels and 301 bridges built in 11 years along its total length of 1,035 kilometers. The railway construction created more than 110,000 local jobs, and helped build about 2,000 kilometers of roads and canals for villages along the railway, benefiting local people. Besides the BRI, the Global Development Initiative, the Global Security Initiative and Global Civilization Initiative have evolved into a crucial cornerstone for building a global community of shared future, offering China's solutions to major challenges pertaining to peace and development for humanity. Facing constant flare-ups of hotspot issues, China has been committed to fulfilling its role as a responsible major country, pushing for the resolution of international and regional flashpoints, such as the Korean Peninsula, Palestine, the Iranian nuclear issue, Syria and Afghanistan, the white paper said. On the Ukraine issue, China has actively promoted talks for peace, put forth four points, four things that the international community should do together and three observations, and released China's position on the political settlement of the Ukraine crisis and has dispatched the special representative of the Chinese government on Eurasian affairs to engage in extensive interactions and exchanges with stakeholders on the political settlement of the Ukraine crisis. Also, through the mediation of China, Saudi Arabia and Iran achieve historic reconciliation earlier this year, setting a fine example for countries in the region to resolve disputes and differences and achieve good neighborly relations through dialogue and consultation, and catalyzing a wave of reconciliation in the Middle East. China has also proposed a range of regional and bilateral initiatives on building communities of shared future and working with stakeholders to build consensus and expand cooperation, there by playing a constructive role in promoting regional peace and development. It also boosts international cooperation in fields including fighting the COVID-19 pandemic, addressing disorder in cyberspace governance and dealing with the global climate challenge. Over the past decade, the vision of a global community of shared future has gained broader support. More countries and people have come to the understanding that this vision serves the common interests of humanity, represents popular calls for peace, justice and progress, and can create the greatest synergy among all nations for building a better world, the white paper said.",CHINA,POLITICS,Photo: Li Xuanmin/GT,Author details not found,Author details not found,33,1000,<FreqDist with 17 samples and 603 outcomes>

F-35: Closer Look at Colossally Costly Jet That Just Can’t Seem to Stay Airborne,Sputnik,2023-09-21,"A US Marine Corps F-35B went down over South Carolina on Sunday after its pilot ejected mid-flight for reasons unknown. Why do F-35s seem so crash-prone? What’s wrong with them? And what role does the waste and fraud in the US military-industrial complex play in creating such a Frankenstein’s monster of an aircraft? Sputnik explores.Debris from the F-35B that went missing over South Carolina on September 17 was found in Williamsburg County, South Carolina, about two hours northeast of Joint Base Charleston on Monday following more than a day of frantic searching by the military. An as yet unspecified “mishap” was blamed for the accident. The pilot escaped unscathed.“The mishap is currently under investigation, and we are unable to provide additional details to preserve the integrity of the investigative process,” the Marine Corps said in a statement Monday. The Marines ordered a two-day global pause in all aerial operations, with the errant F-35B becoming the third major aviation-related accident suffered by the military branch in less than two months.Air units will be discussing “fundamentals of safe flight operations, ground safety, maintenance and flight procedures, and maintaining combat readiness,” the Marine Corps said.How Many F-35s Have Been Lost?Since it started being introduced into service with the Marines (2015), the US Air Force (2016), and the US Navy (2019) and began to be exported to foreign clients (starting with Israel in 2018), the F-35 has gained an unenviable reputation of being a costly, buggy, and crash-prone jet, with the F-35B that went down over South Carolina last week being at least the 11th Lightning II lost since 2018.On September 28, 2018, a US Marine Corps F-35B crashed during a flight near Marine Corps Air Station Beaufort in South Carolina, with a faulty fuel tube blamed for the incident. The pilot emerged unscathed.On April 9, 2019, a Japanese Self- Defense Force F-35A went down off Honshu, Japan. The pilot was killed after losing his bearings and suffering “special disorientation” mid-flight over the ocean.On May 19, 2020, a US Air Force F-35A from the 58th Fighter Squadron crashed while performing a landing at Eglin Air Force Base in western Florida. Pilot error (trying to land at excessive speed) and a mechanical defect related to a flight control glitch that left the plane’s tail unresponsive were blamed. The pilot survived.On September 29, 2020, a US Marine Corps F-35B was lost over Imperial County, California after colliding with a KC-130 tanker during midflight refueling. The tanker crew managed to bring their aircraft down for a hard landing. The F-35 pilot ejected successfully.On November 17, 2021, a British Royal Air Force F-35B plunged into the Mediterranean Sea after its pilot ejected during routine operations. That crash was ultimately blamed on a protective cover getting wedged into the plane’s engine intake.On January 4, 2022, a South Korean Air Force F-35A suffering from issues with its onboard avionics carried out an emergency belly landing. Investigators blamed a bird striking the warplane’s landing gear mid-flight. The pilot emerged unharmed.On January 24, 2022, a US Navy F-35C plunged into the South China Sea after making a hard landing on the USS Carl Vinson super carrier. The pilot and six sailors on the deck of the aircraft carrier were injured. A Navy investigation attributed the incident to pilot error.On October 19, 2022, another F-35, this one from the US Air Force, crashed at Hill Air Force Base in Utah during a training mission. The pilot ejected safely. It was later determined that turbulent air somehow confused the jet’s onboard avionics to the point where the aircraft became uncontrollable.On December 1, 2022, a Marine Corps F-35B collapsed on a military base in Japan after suffering a landing gear failure during training. No one was injured.Finally, on December 15, 2022, a US Navy F-35B crashed while attempting to perform a vertical landing at Naval Air Station Joint Reserve Base Fort Worth in Texas during testing of the jet’s systems. A “harmonic resonance” issue related to the jet’s Pratt & Whitney F135 engine was blamed, with the Pentagon halting further F-35 deliveries by Lockheed until an investigation was concluded.What’s Wrong With the F-35?Nearly 17 years after the F-35’s first flight, and eight years after its adoption into service, the F-35 continues to maintain a troublingly long list of technical bugs affecting both hardware and software. The aircraft, which has an astronomical total estimated purchase and sustainment price tag of over $1.7 trillion, and a per-plane cost of $70-$90 million, has faced years of harsh criticism from US officials, including former President Donald Trump at one point, who said the jet’s costs had spiraled “out of control.”At its heart, the F-35 is the product of an idea that metastasized in the Pentagon after the end of the Cold War, envisioning an all-in-one fighter platform which could be used by every branch of the military, equipped with vertical take-off and landing capability, and carry out a broad array of missions using a variety of onboard weapons. The do-it-all jet was supposed to replace nearly all of America’s fourth-gen fighter, strike, and ground attack aircraft, including the F-16 Falcon, the F/A-18 Hornet and Super Hornet, the AV-8B Harrier II, and others.The jet features just a single onboard engine – the aforementioned Pratt & Whitney F135, with engine-related troubles not only regularly referred to by watchdogs as a “leading driver” of the F-35’s problems remaining “mission capable,” but also making its operation over enemy territory or over the sea risky, since if something goes wrong, the plane doesn’t have a backup engine to limp home with.Throughout its production cycle, the F-35 Lightning II has suffered a dizzying and seemingly endless list of technical problems, from neck-snapping ejection seats to problems, ironically, while operating in stormy weather.In its 2023 report, the congressional Government Accountability Office revealed that the F-35 program “continues to experience schedule delays, cost growth, and late deliveries,” with procurement costs jumping by $13.4 billion since 2019, and modernization behind schedule and over budget.“As of January 2023, of the 821 open deficiencies, the program office characterized five of these as category 1 [i.e. critical issues which could jeopardize flight safety and security], and 816 as category 2, [i.e. those which could impede or constrain mission success].”In all, between December 2006 and 2023, the GAO has reported a whopping 277 category 1 and 2,467 category 2 deficiencies with the aircraft, among them serious issues like cabin over-pressurization, problems with the jets’ night vision systems, software bugs, radar issues, corrosion, ejection seats which could snap pilots’ necks, etc.Is a Culture of Largess to Blame?Sunday’s accident in South Carolina is the latest piece of F-35-related bad news for Lockheed Martin. In June, it was reported that the Pentagon had halted the delivery of any additional upgraded F-35s until major issues related to new Technology Refresh 3 (TR-3) hardware and weapons-related software were resolved. DoD F-35 program director Mike Schmidt told Congress in March that the risk assessment related to the TR-3 hardware upgrade wouldn’t be finished until April 2024.Despite the delays and array of technical problems, the weapons giant has continued to rack up generous contracts related to F-35 procurement and production. For example, in July, the US Navy ordered a $490 million package of equipment from Lockheed “to procure various material mod kits, special test/tooling equipment, as well as…product engineering” for already delivered, but defective planes. In August, Lockheed received another $606 million “fixed-price incentive (firm-target) undefinitized” contract “for long lead time materials, parts, components, and efforts to support of maintaining on-time production and delivery of 173 Lot 19 F-35 Joint Strike Fighter aircraft for Foreign Military Sales (FMS) customers and non-US Department of Defense (DOD) participants.”The terms of the contracts seem to be the culprit behind the F-35’s soaring costs (and Lockheed’s soaring profits, despite delivery of defective products), with so-called “cost-plus” and “undefinitized” contracts effectively making any overruns the buyer’s problem – i.e. that of US taxpayers, and of citizens of any country unfortunate enough to pen contracts for the planes from Lockheed.What About America’s Competitors?The worst part about the F-35’s troublesome history seems to be that the F-35 has already become ""obsolete"" in the sense that many of the US and NATO’s competitors have obtained the ability to defeat them, with Russia and China gaining capabilities to track and target the jets going back to the mid-to-late 2010s. In April, Iran announced that its engineers had created advanced radar technologies to not only detect F-35s, but identify the radar signature of individual F-35 planes, enabling the Islamic Republic to plan defensive operations accordingly.",WORLD,AMERICAS,Picture description not found,Author details not found,Author details not found,60,1305,<FreqDist with 18 samples and 775 outcomes>
Toxic explosion in Nebraska shows US unable to take issues affecting public security seriously: experts,Xu Yelu,2023-09-15,"Barely two months after an explosion in Louisiana, a train carrying toxic perchloric acid has exploded in a Nebraska rail yard on Thursday, prompting evacuation orders to be issued, as huge plumes are seen engulfing the city. Experts said the incident shows the US has been unable to take seriously and overcome major issues affecting public safety and the environment and ecology in the country.The incident happened on Union Pacific Railroad tracks in the city of North Platte. North Platte Volunteer Fire Department announced that they would order those living in the area to evacuate due to the toxic smoke from the railroad, according to media reports.In a post on social media platforms, it said that ""Emergency evacuation for the area between splinter and front North of railroad track due fire at the railroad involving heavy toxic smoke.""In a statement to DailyMail.com, Union Pacific Railroad said that an explosion occurred inside a container which resulted in several railcars catching fire. The railcar did not derail, the company said, and had been in the yard for several hours.Union Pacific said that one of the containers contained a hazardous chemical called perchloric acid, according to Daily Mail.Perchloric is a hazardous material used in food, drugs and biocidal products, as well as explosives, according to the report.Two months ago, a fire at a Louisiana chemical plant triggered explosions that shook homes several miles away and sent flames and smoke billowing into the air in mid-July, prompting emergency officials to urge a few hundred nearby residents to shelter indoors for several hours and to turn off their air conditioners, the Associated Press reported.Antiquated infrastructure and the outdated transportation were one factor. Another was a flawed system of governance in the US transport industry, experts noted. There is no doubt that the US has serious loopholes in the transportation management of hazardous substances, and the relevant error correction mechanism is in fact not effective, which means that this kind of thing will occur in the future, Li Haidong, a professor at the China Foreign Affairs University, told the Global Times on Friday.This shows that the US has been unable to take seriously and overcome serious and major issues affecting public safety and the environment and ecology in the country, Li said. ""It must be said that this is a great irony to the self-proclaimed internal governance of the most advanced country in the world.""Analysts said that the frequent occurrence of similar incidents shows that the error correction mechanism in the US has failed. Apart from this, racism and the proliferation of guns are also clear examples of the failure of error correction mechanisms, experts noted.",WORLD,AMERICAS,"A resident of East Palestine in the state of Ohio, US, angrily points during a town hall meeting held by the US

Greek scholar believes in ‘endless possibilities and vast land’ between China-Greece exchanges,Xu Liuliu,2023-09-14,"Chongqing, Sichuan, Shandong… Stelios Virvidakis expectantly plans his next China tour before a visit by the Global Times at his office in Athens, Greece. The University of Athens professor has grown far busier recently since he and four other Greek scholars launched the Center of Chinese and Greek Ancient Civilizations in February. Over the summer, the center has received two scholars from China who have given lectures on the history of China, and other visiting guests from places like Israel, who offered their views on Chinese medicine and its history, and a lecturer from France with insights in Chinese mathematics and how scholars in ancient China studied the living science.""Students found them to be very interesting and greatly appreciated the lectures,"" Virvidakis told the Global Times. ""Greece and China share so many similarities. So in my opinion, the horizon for our cooperation and exchanges is vast. There are endless possibilities which have not been explored.""Mutual learning Chinese President Xi Jinping replied to a letter from Virvidakis and four other Greek scholars earlier in 2023, extending congratulations over the founding of the Center of Chinese and Greek Ancient Civilizations.Hailing the long history of the Chinese civilization and profound influence of the ancient Greek civilization, Xi said in the letter that more than 2,000 years ago, the two civilizations shone brightly on the two ends of the Eurasian continent, jointly making a fundamental contribution to the evolution of human civilization.Greece's golden era produced many of its great philosophers and literary giants. The era coincided with a period in China in which ""a hundred schools of thought contended with each other"" and flourished together.As early as the 4th century BC, China was known to the Greeks by a beautiful name: Sērikḗ. In the 16th century, Euclid's Elements was introduced into China, paving the way for scientific exchanges between China and the West. The story of Prometheus narrated by Aeschylus was an inspiration to many Chinese revolutionaries. The Republic by Plato and Politics by Aristotle are also among the Greek classics known to have long made a name for themselves in China.In the eyes of Virvidakis, Chinese civilization has always been a culture that attracts people though the language is difficult. However, Chinese art, Chinese painting, Chinese poetry, especially love poems, even detective stories about China, are incredibly fascinating. Chinese director Zhang Yimou, and movies like Farewell My Concubine and Raise the Red Lantern starring Gong Li, are also very popular. Greek archaeologists who are interested in Chinese archeology want to know how China explores the past.In other art forms, the mythology and theater, ""we have tragedy, which is our own tradition. You have Chinese opera with music."" Actors and artists always want to study similarities and look at the differences, which is also the commitment of the center to promoting exchanges and mutual learning between the two civilizations and promoting the development of civilizations in various countries. China also has this appeal because people in the West think ""it's very different, it's exotic, something strange, but then they realize that it's beautiful for them."" So ""they find a lot of aspects that they have not thought about before in order to understand.""

Tiantan, a UNESCO World Heritage Site built in 1420, in Beijing Photo: VCGPhilosophy, a way of life There is a feeling among some people in the West that the Chinese system is different in some ways, said the professor. For instance,the European and American systems place great emphasis on individual rights, but China takes a more holistic approach in which ""harmony, social harmony is more important in sovereign.""""We are not exactly the same and there are also differences. But I don't believe in the so-called clash of civilizations theory that the clash is very deep and we can't live together with our differences,"" he told the Global Times. ""In fact we can live together and have peaceful exchanges. As I said, I don't think there is any danger of Greece threatening China or China occupying Greece.""In February, Virvidakis held a lecture at the center's launching ceremony, titled Philosophy is a Way of Life. Philosophy is not just theory, he said, noting that in ancient Greece and China it didn't mean just making theories about the universe, nature, god, or much of the unknown world. ""It told you how to 'organize' your life to feel happy and achieve harmony with others."" Western philosophy cannot be understood just by itself as there are also Chinese and Indian schools of philosophy among others. ""It is easier to see some similarities in ideas between Confucius and Socrates or Confucius and Aristotle,"" said Virvidakis, explaining why he is so fond of Chinese philosophy, especially Confucius thought. A simple question about what is a good life has a variety of answers in different philosophical theories.  But studying philosophy is practical and a way of life. Modern people don't just derive happiness from materialism. They need art and other emotionally stirring elements in life. In different parts and different cultures of the world,people can share similarities in emotion and sentiment.Virvidakis said that one of the most important reasons for his involving in such studies and exchanges was because ""I'm interested and I want to learn more. I'm a student too. When you are a teacher in your whole life, you're going to be a student.""",ARTS,CULTURE & LEISURE,The University of Athens Photo: VCG,"Reporter, Beijing","Global Times senior reporter, mainly covers the reporting of movies, TV, music and culture news.",43,880,<FreqDist with 16 samples and 473 outcomes>

 The first Saudi ambassador to Palestine Naif bin Bandar Al-Sudairi arrived in the West Bank on Tuesday, the official Palestinian news agency WAFA reported.Leading an official delegation, Al-Sudairi, the non-resident ambassador to Palestine and non-resident consul general in Jerusalem, presented his credentials to Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas at the presidency headquarters in Ramallah, it said.Al-Sudairi's arrival comes amid Israel's efforts to normalize relations with Saudi Arabia.During their meeting, Abbas welcomed Al-Sudairi and said his visit to Palestine and his appointment as Saudi ambassador to the State of Palestine would contribute to ""strengthening the strong fraternal relations that bind the two countries and the two brotherly peoples.""The Saudi ambassador said he hoped that his visit would be ""a successful beginning for strengthening relations in all fields,"" stressing his country's firm and supportive positions for the Palestinian people and their just cause.Earlier in the day, Al-Sudairi told reporters in a statement that ""the Arab Peace Initiative is the basic point in any upcoming agreement,"" after being asked about the fate of the initiative in the event of reaching a normalization deal between Saudi Arabia and Israel.The Arab Peace Initiative was launched in 2002 after it was drafted by Saudi Arabia and adopted by the Arab League.The initiative calls for an end to the conflict between Israel and Palestine and the normalization of relations between Israel and Arab states, in exchange for an Israeli withdrawal from the areas it gained since 1967 and proper settlement to the issue of Palestinian refugees.The Palestinians demanded the establishment of an independent state alongside Israel in all of the Palestinian territories occupied by Israel in 1967, including the entire West Bank and the Gaza Strip, with East Jerusalem as its capital.The Saudi ambassador also confirmed that his country intends to open a consulate in East Jerusalem soon.",PHOTO,WORLD,"Saudi ambassador to Palestine Naif bin Bandar Al-Sudairi (Front) arrives at the Palestinian foreign ministry headquarters in the West Bank city of Ramallah, on Sept. 26, 2023.(Photo: Xinhua)",Author details not found,Author details not found,12,313,<FreqDist with 15 samples and 181 outcomes>
China releases a white paper on its proposals and actions on building a global community of shared future,GT staff reporters,2023-09-26," The Chinese government released a white paper on Tuesday to introduce the theoretical base, practice and development of a global community of shared future, as by presenting China's vision of the course of human development, it counters the hegemonic thinking of certain countries that seek supremacy. The white paper, titled ""A Global Community of Shared Future: China's Proposals and Actions,"" introduced the background for China to raise the concept of a global community of shared future as the world is undergoing changes on a scale unseen in a century with various problems posing unprecedented challenges for human society. The zero-sum game is doomed to fail, the white paper said. But certain countries still cling to this mindset, blindly pursuing absolute security and monopolistic advantages, which will do nothing for their development in the long run but create a major threat to the world. It is increasingly obvious that the obsession with superior strength, and the zero-sum mentality are in conflict with the needs of our times, the white paper said, pointing out that the new era calls for new ideas. To build a global community of shared future is to pursue openness, inclusiveness, mutual benefit, equity and justice, the white paper said. The goal is not to replace one system or civilization with another. Instead, it is about countries with different social systems, ideologies, histories, shared rights, and shared responsibilities in global affairs. The vision of a global community of shared future stands on the right side of history and on the side of human progress. It introduces a new approach for international relations, provides new ideas for global governance, opens up new prospects for international exchanges and draws a new blueprint for a better world, according to the white paper. Such important vision transcends outdated mindsets such as zero-sum game, power politics, and Cold War confrontations. It has become the overall goal of China's major-country diplomacy in the new era, and a great banner that leads the trend of the times and the direction of human progress. The concept of a global community of shared future has deep roots in China's profound cultural heritage and its unique experience of modernization. It carries forward the diplomatic traditions of China and draws on the outstanding achievements of all other civilizations, the white paper said. It also manifests China's time-honored historical traditions, distinct characteristics of the times, and a wealth of humanistic values.  The white paper also pointed out the direction and plan to build a global community of shared future including pressing ahead with a new type of economic globalization in which countries need to pursue a policy of openness and explicitly oppose protectionism, the erection of fences and barriers, unilateral sanctions, and maximum-pressure tactics, so as to connect economies and jointly build an open world economy. Some countries are seeking to decouple from China, enclosing themselves in ""small yards, high fences,"" which will ultimately only backfire, the white paper said. Also, some people overstate the need to ""reduce dependence"" and ""de-risk,"" which is essentially creating new risks. The direction and the plan also include following a peaceful development plan, fostering a new type of international relations, practicing true multilateralism and promoting the common values of humanity. Over the past decade, China has contributed its strength to building a global community of shared future with firm conviction and solid actions. For instance, by July 2023, more than three-quarters of countries in the world and over 30 international organizations had signed agreements on Belt and Road cooperation with China. The BRI originated in China but the opportunities and achievements it creates belong to the whole world. It's an initiative for economic cooperation, not for geopolitical or military alliances, and it's open and inclusive process that neither targets nor excludes any party, the white paper said. Among those BRI projects, for example, the China-Laos Railway began operation on December 3, 2021, with 167 tunnels and 301 bridges built in 11 years along its total length of 1,035 kilometers. The railway construction created more than 110,000 local jobs, and helped build about 2,000 kilometers of roads and canals for villages along the railway, benefiting local people. Besides the BRI, the Global Development Initiative, the Global Security Initiative and Global Civilization Initiative have evolved into a crucial cornerstone for building a global community of shared future, offering China's solutions to major challenges pertaining to peace and development for humanity. Facing constant flare-ups of hotspot issues, China has been committed to fulfilling its role as a responsible major country, pushing for the resolution of international and regional flashpoints, such as the Korean Peninsula, Palestine, the Iranian nuclear issue, Syria and Afghanistan, the white paper said. On the Ukraine issue, China has actively promoted talks for peace, put forth four points, four things that the international community should do together and three observations, and released China's position on the political settlement of the Ukraine crisis and has dispatched the special representative of the Chinese government on Eurasian affairs to engage in extensive interactions and exchanges with stakeholders on the political settlement of the Ukraine crisis. Also, through the mediation of China, Saudi Arabia and Iran achieve historic reconciliation earlier this year, setting a fine example for countries in the region to resolve disputes and differences and achieve good neighborly relations through dialogue and consultation, and catalyzing a wave of reconciliation in the Middle East. China has also proposed a range of regional and bilateral initiatives on building communities of shared future and working with stakeholders to build consensus and expand cooperation, there by playing a constructive role in promoting regional peace and development. It also boosts international cooperation in fields including fighting the COVID-19 pandemic, addressing disorder in cyberspace governance and dealing with the global climate challenge. Over the past decade, the vision of a global community of shared future has gained broader support. More countries and people have come to the understanding that this vision serves the common interests of humanity, represents popular calls for peace, justice and progress, and can create the greatest synergy among all nations for building a better world, the white paper said.",CHINA,POLITICS,Photo: Li Xuanmin/GT,Author details not found,Author details not found,33,1000,<FreqDist with 17 samples and 603 outcomes>

F-35: Closer Look at Colossally Costly Jet That Just Can’t Seem to Stay Airborne,Sputnik,2023-09-21,"A US Marine Corps F-35B went down over South Carolina on Sunday after its pilot ejected mid-flight for reasons unknown. Why do F-35s seem so crash-prone? What’s wrong with them? And what role does the waste and fraud in the US military-industrial complex play in creating such a Frankenstein’s monster of an aircraft? Sputnik explores.Debris from the F-35B that went missing over South Carolina on September 17 was found in Williamsburg County, South Carolina, about two hours northeast of Joint Base Charleston on Monday following more than a day of frantic searching by the military. An as yet unspecified “mishap” was blamed for the accident. The pilot escaped unscathed.“The mishap is currently under investigation, and we are unable to provide additional details to preserve the integrity of the investigative process,” the Marine Corps said in a statement Monday. The Marines ordered a two-day global pause in all aerial operations, with the errant F-35B becoming the third major aviation-related accident suffered by the military branch in less than two months.Air units will be discussing “fundamentals of safe flight operations, ground safety, maintenance and flight procedures, and maintaining combat readiness,” the Marine Corps said.How Many F-35s Have Been Lost?Since it started being introduced into service with the Marines (2015), the US Air Force (2016), and the US Navy (2019) and began to be exported to foreign clients (starting with Israel in 2018), the F-35 has gained an unenviable reputation of being a costly, buggy, and crash-prone jet, with the F-35B that went down over South Carolina last week being at least the 11th Lightning II lost since 2018.On September 28, 2018, a US Marine Corps F-35B crashed during a flight near Marine Corps Air Station Beaufort in South Carolina, with a faulty fuel tube blamed for the incident. The pilot emerged unscathed.On April 9, 2019, a Japanese Self- Defense Force F-35A went down off Honshu, Japan. The pilot was killed after losing his bearings and suffering “special disorientation” mid-flight over the ocean.On May 19, 2020, a US Air Force F-35A from the 58th Fighter Squadron crashed while performing a landing at Eglin Air Force Base in western Florida. Pilot error (trying to land at excessive speed) and a mechanical defect related to a flight control glitch that left the plane’s tail unresponsive were blamed. The pilot survived.On September 29, 2020, a US Marine Corps F-35B was lost over Imperial County, California after colliding with a KC-130 tanker during midflight refueling. The tanker crew managed to bring their aircraft down for a hard landing. The F-35 pilot ejected successfully.On November 17, 2021, a British Royal Air Force F-35B plunged into the Mediterranean Sea after its pilot ejected during routine operations. That crash was ultimately blamed on a protective cover getting wedged into the plane’s engine intake.On January 4, 2022, a South Korean Air Force F-35A suffering from issues with its onboard avionics carried out an emergency belly landing. Investigators blamed a bird striking the warplane’s landing gear mid-flight. The pilot emerged unharmed.On January 24, 2022, a US Navy F-35C plunged into the South China Sea after making a hard landing on the USS Carl Vinson super carrier. The pilot and six sailors on the deck of the aircraft carrier were injured. A Navy investigation attributed the incident to pilot error.On October 19, 2022, another F-35, this one from the US Air Force, crashed at Hill Air Force Base in Utah during a training mission. The pilot ejected safely. It was later determined that turbulent air somehow confused the jet’s onboard avionics to the point where the aircraft became uncontrollable.On December 1, 2022, a Marine Corps F-35B collapsed on a military base in Japan after suffering a landing gear failure during training. No one was injured.Finally, on December 15, 2022, a US Navy F-35B crashed while attempting to perform a vertical landing at Naval Air Station Joint Reserve Base Fort Worth in Texas during testing of the jet’s systems. A “harmonic resonance” issue related to the jet’s Pratt & Whitney F135 engine was blamed, with the Pentagon halting further F-35 deliveries by Lockheed until an investigation was concluded.What’s Wrong With the F-35?Nearly 17 years after the F-35’s first flight, and eight years after its adoption into service, the F-35 continues to maintain a troublingly long list of technical bugs affecting both hardware and software. The aircraft, which has an astronomical total estimated purchase and sustainment price tag of over $1.7 trillion, and a per-plane cost of $70-$90 million, has faced years of harsh criticism from US officials, including former President Donald Trump at one point, who said the jet’s costs had spiraled “out of control.”At its heart, the F-35 is the product of an idea that metastasized in the Pentagon after the end of the Cold War, envisioning an all-in-one fighter platform which could be used by every branch of the military, equipped with vertical take-off and landing capability, and carry out a broad array of missions using a variety of onboard weapons. The do-it-all jet was supposed to replace nearly all of America’s fourth-gen fighter, strike, and ground attack aircraft, including the F-16 Falcon, the F/A-18 Hornet and Super Hornet, the AV-8B Harrier II, and others.The jet features just a single onboard engine – the aforementioned Pratt & Whitney F135, with engine-related troubles not only regularly referred to by watchdogs as a “leading driver” of the F-35’s problems remaining “mission capable,” but also making its operation over enemy territory or over the sea risky, since if something goes wrong, the plane doesn’t have a backup engine to limp home with.Throughout its production cycle, the F-35 Lightning II has suffered a dizzying and seemingly endless list of technical problems, from neck-snapping ejection seats to problems, ironically, while operating in stormy weather.In its 2023 report, the congressional Government Accountability Office revealed that the F-35 program “continues to experience schedule delays, cost growth, and late deliveries,” with procurement costs jumping by $13.4 billion since 2019, and modernization behind schedule and over budget.“As of January 2023, of the 821 open deficiencies, the program office characterized five of these as category 1 [i.e. critical issues which could jeopardize flight safety and security], and 816 as category 2, [i.e. those which could impede or constrain mission success].”In all, between December 2006 and 2023, the GAO has reported a whopping 277 category 1 and 2,467 category 2 deficiencies with the aircraft, among them serious issues like cabin over-pressurization, problems with the jets’ night vision systems, software bugs, radar issues, corrosion, ejection seats which could snap pilots’ necks, etc.Is a Culture of Largess to Blame?Sunday’s accident in South Carolina is the latest piece of F-35-related bad news for Lockheed Martin. In June, it was reported that the Pentagon had halted the delivery of any additional upgraded F-35s until major issues related to new Technology Refresh 3 (TR-3) hardware and weapons-related software were resolved. DoD F-35 program director Mike Schmidt told Congress in March that the risk assessment related to the TR-3 hardware upgrade wouldn’t be finished until April 2024.Despite the delays and array of technical problems, the weapons giant has continued to rack up generous contracts related to F-35 procurement and production. For example, in July, the US Navy ordered a $490 million package of equipment from Lockheed “to procure various material mod kits, special test/tooling equipment, as well as…product engineering” for already delivered, but defective planes. In August, Lockheed received another $606 million “fixed-price incentive (firm-target) undefinitized” contract “for long lead time materials, parts, components, and efforts to support of maintaining on-time production and delivery of 173 Lot 19 F-35 Joint Strike Fighter aircraft for Foreign Military Sales (FMS) customers and non-US Department of Defense (DOD) participants.”The terms of the contracts seem to be the culprit behind the F-35’s soaring costs (and Lockheed’s soaring profits, despite delivery of defective products), with so-called “cost-plus” and “undefinitized” contracts effectively making any overruns the buyer’s problem – i.e. that of US taxpayers, and of citizens of any country unfortunate enough to pen contracts for the planes from Lockheed.What About America’s Competitors?The worst part about the F-35’s troublesome history seems to be that the F-35 has already become ""obsolete"" in the sense that many of the US and NATO’s competitors have obtained the ability to defeat them, with Russia and China gaining capabilities to track and target the jets going back to the mid-to-late 2010s. In April, Iran announced that its engineers had created advanced radar technologies to not only detect F-35s, but identify the radar signature of individual F-35 planes, enabling the Islamic Republic to plan defensive operations accordingly.",WORLD,AMERICAS,Picture description not found,Author details not found,Author details not found,60,1305,<FreqDist with 18 samples and 775 outcomes>
Toxic explosion in Nebraska shows US unable to take issues affecting public security seriously: experts,Xu Yelu,2023-09-15,"Barely two months after an explosion in Louisiana, a train carrying toxic perchloric acid has exploded in a Nebraska rail yard on Thursday, prompting evacuation orders to be issued, as huge plumes are seen engulfing the city. Experts said the incident shows the US has been unable to take seriously and overcome major issues affecting public safety and the environment and ecology in the country.The incident happened on Union Pacific Railroad tracks in the city of North Platte. North Platte Volunteer Fire Department announced that they would order those living in the area to evacuate due to the toxic smoke from the railroad, according to media reports.In a post on social media platforms, it said that ""Emergency evacuation for the area between splinter and front North of railroad track due fire at the railroad involving heavy toxic smoke.""In a statement to DailyMail.com, Union Pacific Railroad said that an explosion occurred inside a container which resulted in several railcars catching fire. The railcar did not derail, the company said, and had been in the yard for several hours.Union Pacific said that one of the containers contained a hazardous chemical called perchloric acid, according to Daily Mail.Perchloric is a hazardous material used in food, drugs and biocidal products, as well as explosives, according to the report.Two months ago, a fire at a Louisiana chemical plant triggered explosions that shook homes several miles away and sent flames and smoke billowing into the air in mid-July, prompting emergency officials to urge a few hundred nearby residents to shelter indoors for several hours and to turn off their air conditioners, the Associated Press reported.Antiquated infrastructure and the outdated transportation were one factor. Another was a flawed system of governance in the US transport industry, experts noted. There is no doubt that the US has serious loopholes in the transportation management of hazardous substances, and the relevant error correction mechanism is in fact not effective, which means that this kind of thing will occur in the future, Li Haidong, a professor at the China Foreign Affairs University, told the Global Times on Friday.This shows that the US has been unable to take seriously and overcome serious and major issues affecting public safety and the environment and ecology in the country, Li said. ""It must be said that this is a great irony to the self-proclaimed internal governance of the most advanced country in the world.""Analysts said that the frequent occurrence of similar incidents shows that the error correction mechanism in the US has failed. Apart from this, racism and the proliferation of guns are also clear examples of the failure of error correction mechanisms, experts noted.",WORLD,AMERICAS,"A resident of East Palestine in the state of Ohio, US, angrily points during a town hall meeting held by the US

Greek scholar believes in ‘endless possibilities and vast land’ between China-Greece exchanges,Xu Liuliu,2023-09-14,"Chongqing, Sichuan, Shandong… Stelios Virvidakis expectantly plans his next China tour before a visit by the Global Times at his office in Athens, Greece. The University of Athens professor has grown far busier recently since he and four other Greek scholars launched the Center of Chinese and Greek Ancient Civilizations in February. Over the summer, the center has received two scholars from China who have given lectures on the history of China, and other visiting guests from places like Israel, who offered their views on Chinese medicine and its history, and a lecturer from France with insights in Chinese mathematics and how scholars in ancient China studied the living science.""Students found them to be very interesting and greatly appreciated the lectures,"" Virvidakis told the Global Times. ""Greece and China share so many similarities. So in my opinion, the horizon for our cooperation and exchanges is vast. There are endless possibilities which have not been explored.""Mutual learning Chinese President Xi Jinping replied to a letter from Virvidakis and four other Greek scholars earlier in 2023, extending congratulations over the founding of the Center of Chinese and Greek Ancient Civilizations.Hailing the long history of the Chinese civilization and profound influence of the ancient Greek civilization, Xi said in the letter that more than 2,000 years ago, the two civilizations shone brightly on the two ends of the Eurasian continent, jointly making a fundamental contribution to the evolution of human civilization.Greece's golden era produced many of its great philosophers and literary giants. The era coincided with a period in China in which ""a hundred schools of thought contended with each other"" and flourished together.As early as the 4th century BC, China was known to the Greeks by a beautiful name: Sērikḗ. In the 16th century, Euclid's Elements was introduced into China, paving the way for scientific exchanges between China and the West. The story of Prometheus narrated by Aeschylus was an inspiration to many Chinese revolutionaries. The Republic by Plato and Politics by Aristotle are also among the Greek classics known to have long made a name for themselves in China.In the eyes of Virvidakis, Chinese civilization has always been a culture that attracts people though the language is difficult. However, Chinese art, Chinese painting, Chinese poetry, especially love poems, even detective stories about China, are incredibly fascinating. Chinese director Zhang Yimou, and movies like Farewell My Concubine and Raise the Red Lantern starring Gong Li, are also very popular. Greek archaeologists who are interested in Chinese archeology want to know how China explores the past.In other art forms, the mythology and theater, ""we have tragedy, which is our own tradition. You have Chinese opera with music."" Actors and artists always want to study similarities and look at the differences, which is also the commitment of the center to promoting exchanges and mutual learning between the two civilizations and promoting the development of civilizations in various countries. China also has this appeal because people in the West think ""it's very different, it's exotic, something strange, but then they realize that it's beautiful for them."" So ""they find a lot of aspects that they have not thought about before in order to understand.""

Tiantan, a UNESCO World Heritage Site built in 1420, in Beijing Photo: VCGPhilosophy, a way of life There is a feeling among some people in the West that the Chinese system is different in some ways, said the professor. For instance,the European and American systems place great emphasis on individual rights, but China takes a more holistic approach in which ""harmony, social harmony is more important in sovereign.""""We are not exactly the same and there are also differences. But I don't believe in the so-called clash of civilizations theory that the clash is very deep and we can't live together with our differences,"" he told the Global Times. ""In fact we can live together and have peaceful exchanges. As I said, I don't think there is any danger of Greece threatening China or China occupying Greece.""In February, Virvidakis held a lecture at the center's launching ceremony, titled Philosophy is a Way of Life. Philosophy is not just theory, he said, noting that in ancient Greece and China it didn't mean just making theories about the universe, nature, god, or much of the unknown world. ""It told you how to 'organize' your life to feel happy and achieve harmony with others."" Western philosophy cannot be understood just by itself as there are also Chinese and Indian schools of philosophy among others. ""It is easier to see some similarities in ideas between Confucius and Socrates or Confucius and Aristotle,"" said Virvidakis, explaining why he is so fond of Chinese philosophy, especially Confucius thought. A simple question about what is a good life has a variety of answers in different philosophical theories.  But studying philosophy is practical and a way of life. Modern people don't just derive happiness from materialism. They need art and other emotionally stirring elements in life. In different parts and different cultures of the world,people can share similarities in emotion and sentiment.Virvidakis said that one of the most important reasons for his involving in such studies and exchanges was because ""I'm interested and I want to learn more. I'm a student too. When you are a teacher in your whole life, you're going to be a student.""",ARTS,CULTURE & LEISURE,The University of Athens Photo: VCG,"Reporter, Beijing","Global Times senior reporter, mainly covers the reporting of movies, TV, music and culture news.",43,880,<FreqDist with 16 samples and 473 outcomes>

 The first Saudi ambassador to Palestine Naif bin Bandar Al-Sudairi arrived in the West Bank on Tuesday, the official Palestinian news agency WAFA reported.Leading an official delegation, Al-Sudairi, the non-resident ambassador to Palestine and non-resident consul general in Jerusalem, presented his credentials to Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas at the presidency headquarters in Ramallah, it said.Al-Sudairi's arrival comes amid Israel's efforts to normalize relations with Saudi Arabia.During their meeting, Abbas welcomed Al-Sudairi and said his visit to Palestine and his appointment as Saudi ambassador to the State of Palestine would contribute to ""strengthening the strong fraternal relations that bind the two countries and the two brotherly peoples.""The Saudi ambassador said he hoped that his visit would be ""a successful beginning for strengthening relations in all fields,"" stressing his country's firm and supportive positions for the Palestinian people and their just cause.Earlier in the day, Al-Sudairi told reporters in a statement that ""the Arab Peace Initiative is the basic point in any upcoming agreement,"" after being asked about the fate of the initiative in the event of reaching a normalization deal between Saudi Arabia and Israel.The Arab Peace Initiative was launched in 2002 after it was drafted by Saudi Arabia and adopted by the Arab League.The initiative calls for an end to the conflict between Israel and Palestine and the normalization of relations between Israel and Arab states, in exchange for an Israeli withdrawal from the areas it gained since 1967 and proper settlement to the issue of Palestinian refugees.The Palestinians demanded the establishment of an independent state alongside Israel in all of the Palestinian territories occupied by Israel in 1967, including the entire West Bank and the Gaza Strip, with East Jerusalem as its capital.The Saudi ambassador also confirmed that his country intends to open a consulate in East Jerusalem soon.",PHOTO,WORLD,"Saudi ambassador to Palestine Naif bin Bandar Al-Sudairi (Front) arrives at the Palestinian foreign ministry headquarters in the West Bank city of Ramallah, on Sept. 26, 2023.(Photo: Xinhua)",Author details not found,Author details not found,12,313,<FreqDist with 15 samples and 181 outcomes>
China releases a white paper on its proposals and actions on building a global community of shared future,GT staff reporters,2023-09-26," The Chinese government released a white paper on Tuesday to introduce the theoretical base, practice and development of a global community of shared future, as by presenting China's vision of the course of human development, it counters the hegemonic thinking of certain countries that seek supremacy. The white paper, titled ""A Global Community of Shared Future: China's Proposals and Actions,"" introduced the background for China to raise the concept of a global community of shared future as the world is undergoing changes on a scale unseen in a century with various problems posing unprecedented challenges for human society. The zero-sum game is doomed to fail, the white paper said. But certain countries still cling to this mindset, blindly pursuing absolute security and monopolistic advantages, which will do nothing for their development in the long run but create a major threat to the world. It is increasingly obvious that the obsession with superior strength, and the zero-sum mentality are in conflict with the needs of our times, the white paper said, pointing out that the new era calls for new ideas. To build a global community of shared future is to pursue openness, inclusiveness, mutual benefit, equity and justice, the white paper said. The goal is not to replace one system or civilization with another. Instead, it is about countries with different social systems, ideologies, histories, shared rights, and shared responsibilities in global affairs. The vision of a global community of shared future stands on the right side of history and on the side of human progress. It introduces a new approach for international relations, provides new ideas for global governance, opens up new prospects for international exchanges and draws a new blueprint for a better world, according to the white paper. Such important vision transcends outdated mindsets such as zero-sum game, power politics, and Cold War confrontations. It has become the overall goal of China's major-country diplomacy in the new era, and a great banner that leads the trend of the times and the direction of human progress. The concept of a global community of shared future has deep roots in China's profound cultural heritage and its unique experience of modernization. It carries forward the diplomatic traditions of China and draws on the outstanding achievements of all other civilizations, the white paper said. It also manifests China's time-honored historical traditions, distinct characteristics of the times, and a wealth of humanistic values.  The white paper also pointed out the direction and plan to build a global community of shared future including pressing ahead with a new type of economic globalization in which countries need to pursue a policy of openness and explicitly oppose protectionism, the erection of fences and barriers, unilateral sanctions, and maximum-pressure tactics, so as to connect economies and jointly build an open world economy. Some countries are seeking to decouple from China, enclosing themselves in ""small yards, high fences,"" which will ultimately only backfire, the white paper said. Also, some people overstate the need to ""reduce dependence"" and ""de-risk,"" which is essentially creating new risks. The direction and the plan also include following a peaceful development plan, fostering a new type of international relations, practicing true multilateralism and promoting the common values of humanity. Over the past decade, China has contributed its strength to building a global community of shared future with firm conviction and solid actions. For instance, by July 2023, more than three-quarters of countries in the world and over 30 international organizations had signed agreements on Belt and Road cooperation with China. The BRI originated in China but the opportunities and achievements it creates belong to the whole world. It's an initiative for economic cooperation, not for geopolitical or military alliances, and it's open and inclusive process that neither targets nor excludes any party, the white paper said. Among those BRI projects, for example, the China-Laos Railway began operation on December 3, 2021, with 167 tunnels and 301 bridges built in 11 years along its total length of 1,035 kilometers. The railway construction created more than 110,000 local jobs, and helped build about 2,000 kilometers of roads and canals for villages along the railway, benefiting local people. Besides the BRI, the Global Development Initiative, the Global Security Initiative and Global Civilization Initiative have evolved into a crucial cornerstone for building a global community of shared future, offering China's solutions to major challenges pertaining to peace and development for humanity. Facing constant flare-ups of hotspot issues, China has been committed to fulfilling its role as a responsible major country, pushing for the resolution of international and regional flashpoints, such as the Korean Peninsula, Palestine, the Iranian nuclear issue, Syria and Afghanistan, the white paper said. On the Ukraine issue, China has actively promoted talks for peace, put forth four points, four things that the international community should do together and three observations, and released China's position on the political settlement of the Ukraine crisis and has dispatched the special representative of the Chinese government on Eurasian affairs to engage in extensive interactions and exchanges with stakeholders on the political settlement of the Ukraine crisis. Also, through the mediation of China, Saudi Arabia and Iran achieve historic reconciliation earlier this year, setting a fine example for countries in the region to resolve disputes and differences and achieve good neighborly relations through dialogue and consultation, and catalyzing a wave of reconciliation in the Middle East. China has also proposed a range of regional and bilateral initiatives on building communities of shared future and working with stakeholders to build consensus and expand cooperation, there by playing a constructive role in promoting regional peace and development. It also boosts international cooperation in fields including fighting the COVID-19 pandemic, addressing disorder in cyberspace governance and dealing with the global climate challenge. Over the past decade, the vision of a global community of shared future has gained broader support. More countries and people have come to the understanding that this vision serves the common interests of humanity, represents popular calls for peace, justice and progress, and can create the greatest synergy among all nations for building a better world, the white paper said.",CHINA,POLITICS,Photo: Li Xuanmin/GT,Author details not found,Author details not found,33,1000,<FreqDist with 17 samples and 603 outcomes>

F-35: Closer Look at Colossally Costly Jet That Just Can’t Seem to Stay Airborne,Sputnik,2023-09-21,"A US Marine Corps F-35B went down over South Carolina on Sunday after its pilot ejected mid-flight for reasons unknown. Why do F-35s seem so crash-prone? What’s wrong with them? And what role does the waste and fraud in the US military-industrial complex play in creating such a Frankenstein’s monster of an aircraft? Sputnik explores.Debris from the F-35B that went missing over South Carolina on September 17 was found in Williamsburg County, South Carolina, about two hours northeast of Joint Base Charleston on Monday following more than a day of frantic searching by the military. An as yet unspecified “mishap” was blamed for the accident. The pilot escaped unscathed.“The mishap is currently under investigation, and we are unable to provide additional details to preserve the integrity of the investigative process,” the Marine Corps said in a statement Monday. The Marines ordered a two-day global pause in all aerial operations, with the errant F-35B becoming the third major aviation-related accident suffered by the military branch in less than two months.Air units will be discussing “fundamentals of safe flight operations, ground safety, maintenance and flight procedures, and maintaining combat readiness,” the Marine Corps said.How Many F-35s Have Been Lost?Since it started being introduced into service with the Marines (2015), the US Air Force (2016), and the US Navy (2019) and began to be exported to foreign clients (starting with Israel in 2018), the F-35 has gained an unenviable reputation of being a costly, buggy, and crash-prone jet, with the F-35B that went down over South Carolina last week being at least the 11th Lightning II lost since 2018.On September 28, 2018, a US Marine Corps F-35B crashed during a flight near Marine Corps Air Station Beaufort in South Carolina, with a faulty fuel tube blamed for the incident. The pilot emerged unscathed.On April 9, 2019, a Japanese Self- Defense Force F-35A went down off Honshu, Japan. The pilot was killed after losing his bearings and suffering “special disorientation” mid-flight over the ocean.On May 19, 2020, a US Air Force F-35A from the 58th Fighter Squadron crashed while performing a landing at Eglin Air Force Base in western Florida. Pilot error (trying to land at excessive speed) and a mechanical defect related to a flight control glitch that left the plane’s tail unresponsive were blamed. The pilot survived.On September 29, 2020, a US Marine Corps F-35B was lost over Imperial County, California after colliding with a KC-130 tanker during midflight refueling. The tanker crew managed to bring their aircraft down for a hard landing. The F-35 pilot ejected successfully.On November 17, 2021, a British Royal Air Force F-35B plunged into the Mediterranean Sea after its pilot ejected during routine operations. That crash was ultimately blamed on a protective cover getting wedged into the plane’s engine intake.On January 4, 2022, a South Korean Air Force F-35A suffering from issues with its onboard avionics carried out an emergency belly landing. Investigators blamed a bird striking the warplane’s landing gear mid-flight. The pilot emerged unharmed.On January 24, 2022, a US Navy F-35C plunged into the South China Sea after making a hard landing on the USS Carl Vinson super carrier. The pilot and six sailors on the deck of the aircraft carrier were injured. A Navy investigation attributed the incident to pilot error.On October 19, 2022, another F-35, this one from the US Air Force, crashed at Hill Air Force Base in Utah during a training mission. The pilot ejected safely. It was later determined that turbulent air somehow confused the jet’s onboard avionics to the point where the aircraft became uncontrollable.On December 1, 2022, a Marine Corps F-35B collapsed on a military base in Japan after suffering a landing gear failure during training. No one was injured.Finally, on December 15, 2022, a US Navy F-35B crashed while attempting to perform a vertical landing at Naval Air Station Joint Reserve Base Fort Worth in Texas during testing of the jet’s systems. A “harmonic resonance” issue related to the jet’s Pratt & Whitney F135 engine was blamed, with the Pentagon halting further F-35 deliveries by Lockheed until an investigation was concluded.What’s Wrong With the F-35?Nearly 17 years after the F-35’s first flight, and eight years after its adoption into service, the F-35 continues to maintain a troublingly long list of technical bugs affecting both hardware and software. The aircraft, which has an astronomical total estimated purchase and sustainment price tag of over $1.7 trillion, and a per-plane cost of $70-$90 million, has faced years of harsh criticism from US officials, including former President Donald Trump at one point, who said the jet’s costs had spiraled “out of control.”At its heart, the F-35 is the product of an idea that metastasized in the Pentagon after the end of the Cold War, envisioning an all-in-one fighter platform which could be used by every branch of the military, equipped with vertical take-off and landing capability, and carry out a broad array of missions using a variety of onboard weapons. The do-it-all jet was supposed to replace nearly all of America’s fourth-gen fighter, strike, and ground attack aircraft, including the F-16 Falcon, the F/A-18 Hornet and Super Hornet, the AV-8B Harrier II, and others.The jet features just a single onboard engine – the aforementioned Pratt & Whitney F135, with engine-related troubles not only regularly referred to by watchdogs as a “leading driver” of the F-35’s problems remaining “mission capable,” but also making its operation over enemy territory or over the sea risky, since if something goes wrong, the plane doesn’t have a backup engine to limp home with.Throughout its production cycle, the F-35 Lightning II has suffered a dizzying and seemingly endless list of technical problems, from neck-snapping ejection seats to problems, ironically, while operating in stormy weather.In its 2023 report, the congressional Government Accountability Office revealed that the F-35 program “continues to experience schedule delays, cost growth, and late deliveries,” with procurement costs jumping by $13.4 billion since 2019, and modernization behind schedule and over budget.“As of January 2023, of the 821 open deficiencies, the program office characterized five of these as category 1 [i.e. critical issues which could jeopardize flight safety and security], and 816 as category 2, [i.e. those which could impede or constrain mission success].”In all, between December 2006 and 2023, the GAO has reported a whopping 277 category 1 and 2,467 category 2 deficiencies with the aircraft, among them serious issues like cabin over-pressurization, problems with the jets’ night vision systems, software bugs, radar issues, corrosion, ejection seats which could snap pilots’ necks, etc.Is a Culture of Largess to Blame?Sunday’s accident in South Carolina is the latest piece of F-35-related bad news for Lockheed Martin. In June, it was reported that the Pentagon had halted the delivery of any additional upgraded F-35s until major issues related to new Technology Refresh 3 (TR-3) hardware and weapons-related software were resolved. DoD F-35 program director Mike Schmidt told Congress in March that the risk assessment related to the TR-3 hardware upgrade wouldn’t be finished until April 2024.Despite the delays and array of technical problems, the weapons giant has continued to rack up generous contracts related to F-35 procurement and production. For example, in July, the US Navy ordered a $490 million package of equipment from Lockheed “to procure various material mod kits, special test/tooling equipment, as well as…product engineering” for already delivered, but defective planes. In August, Lockheed received another $606 million “fixed-price incentive (firm-target) undefinitized” contract “for long lead time materials, parts, components, and efforts to support of maintaining on-time production and delivery of 173 Lot 19 F-35 Joint Strike Fighter aircraft for Foreign Military Sales (FMS) customers and non-US Department of Defense (DOD) participants.”The terms of the contracts seem to be the culprit behind the F-35’s soaring costs (and Lockheed’s soaring profits, despite delivery of defective products), with so-called “cost-plus” and “undefinitized” contracts effectively making any overruns the buyer’s problem – i.e. that of US taxpayers, and of citizens of any country unfortunate enough to pen contracts for the planes from Lockheed.What About America’s Competitors?The worst part about the F-35’s troublesome history seems to be that the F-35 has already become ""obsolete"" in the sense that many of the US and NATO’s competitors have obtained the ability to defeat them, with Russia and China gaining capabilities to track and target the jets going back to the mid-to-late 2010s. In April, Iran announced that its engineers had created advanced radar technologies to not only detect F-35s, but identify the radar signature of individual F-35 planes, enabling the Islamic Republic to plan defensive operations accordingly.",WORLD,AMERICAS,Picture description not found,Author details not found,Author details not found,60,1305,<FreqDist with 18 samples and 775 outcomes>
Toxic explosion in Nebraska shows US unable to take issues affecting public security seriously: experts,Xu Yelu,2023-09-15,"Barely two months after an explosion in Louisiana, a train carrying toxic perchloric acid has exploded in a Nebraska rail yard on Thursday, prompting evacuation orders to be issued, as huge plumes are seen engulfing the city. Experts said the incident shows the US has been unable to take seriously and overcome major issues affecting public safety and the environment and ecology in the country.The incident happened on Union Pacific Railroad tracks in the city of North Platte. North Platte Volunteer Fire Department announced that they would order those living in the area to evacuate due to the toxic smoke from the railroad, according to media reports.In a post on social media platforms, it said that ""Emergency evacuation for the area between splinter and front North of railroad track due fire at the railroad involving heavy toxic smoke.""In a statement to DailyMail.com, Union Pacific Railroad said that an explosion occurred inside a container which resulted in several railcars catching fire. The railcar did not derail, the company said, and had been in the yard for several hours.Union Pacific said that one of the containers contained a hazardous chemical called perchloric acid, according to Daily Mail.Perchloric is a hazardous material used in food, drugs and biocidal products, as well as explosives, according to the report.Two months ago, a fire at a Louisiana chemical plant triggered explosions that shook homes several miles away and sent flames and smoke billowing into the air in mid-July, prompting emergency officials to urge a few hundred nearby residents to shelter indoors for several hours and to turn off their air conditioners, the Associated Press reported.Antiquated infrastructure and the outdated transportation were one factor. Another was a flawed system of governance in the US transport industry, experts noted. There is no doubt that the US has serious loopholes in the transportation management of hazardous substances, and the relevant error correction mechanism is in fact not effective, which means that this kind of thing will occur in the future, Li Haidong, a professor at the China Foreign Affairs University, told the Global Times on Friday.This shows that the US has been unable to take seriously and overcome serious and major issues affecting public safety and the environment and ecology in the country, Li said. ""It must be said that this is a great irony to the self-proclaimed internal governance of the most advanced country in the world.""Analysts said that the frequent occurrence of similar incidents shows that the error correction mechanism in the US has failed. Apart from this, racism and the proliferation of guns are also clear examples of the failure of error correction mechanisms, experts noted.",WORLD,AMERICAS,"A resident of East Palestine in the state of Ohio, US, angrily points during a town hall meeting held by the US

Greek scholar believes in ‘endless possibilities and vast land’ between China-Greece exchanges,Xu Liuliu,2023-09-14,"Chongqing, Sichuan, Shandong… Stelios Virvidakis expectantly plans his next China tour before a visit by the Global Times at his office in Athens, Greece. The University of Athens professor has grown far busier recently since he and four other Greek scholars launched the Center of Chinese and Greek Ancient Civilizations in February. Over the summer, the center has received two scholars from China who have given lectures on the history of China, and other visiting guests from places like Israel, who offered their views on Chinese medicine and its history, and a lecturer from France with insights in Chinese mathematics and how scholars in ancient China studied the living science.""Students found them to be very interesting and greatly appreciated the lectures,"" Virvidakis told the Global Times. ""Greece and China share so many similarities. So in my opinion, the horizon for our cooperation and exchanges is vast. There are endless possibilities which have not been explored.""Mutual learning Chinese President Xi Jinping replied to a letter from Virvidakis and four other Greek scholars earlier in 2023, extending congratulations over the founding of the Center of Chinese and Greek Ancient Civilizations.Hailing the long history of the Chinese civilization and profound influence of the ancient Greek civilization, Xi said in the letter that more than 2,000 years ago, the two civilizations shone brightly on the two ends of the Eurasian continent, jointly making a fundamental contribution to the evolution of human civilization.Greece's golden era produced many of its great philosophers and literary giants. The era coincided with a period in China in which ""a hundred schools of thought contended with each other"" and flourished together.As early as the 4th century BC, China was known to the Greeks by a beautiful name: Sērikḗ. In the 16th century, Euclid's Elements was introduced into China, paving the way for scientific exchanges between China and the West. The story of Prometheus narrated by Aeschylus was an inspiration to many Chinese revolutionaries. The Republic by Plato and Politics by Aristotle are also among the Greek classics known to have long made a name for themselves in China.In the eyes of Virvidakis, Chinese civilization has always been a culture that attracts people though the language is difficult. However, Chinese art, Chinese painting, Chinese poetry, especially love poems, even detective stories about China, are incredibly fascinating. Chinese director Zhang Yimou, and movies like Farewell My Concubine and Raise the Red Lantern starring Gong Li, are also very popular. Greek archaeologists who are interested in Chinese archeology want to know how China explores the past.In other art forms, the mythology and theater, ""we have tragedy, which is our own tradition. You have Chinese opera with music."" Actors and artists always want to study similarities and look at the differences, which is also the commitment of the center to promoting exchanges and mutual learning between the two civilizations and promoting the development of civilizations in various countries. China also has this appeal because people in the West think ""it's very different, it's exotic, something strange, but then they realize that it's beautiful for them."" So ""they find a lot of aspects that they have not thought about before in order to understand.""

For instance,the European and American systems place great emphasis on individual rights, but China takes a more holistic approach in which ""harmony, social harmony is more important in sovereign.""""We are not exactly the same and there are also differences. But I don't believe in the so-called clash of civilizations theory that the clash is very deep and we can't live together with our differences,"" he told the Global Times. ""In fact we can live together and have peaceful exchanges. As I said, I don't think there is any danger of Greece threatening China or China occupying Greece.""In February, Virvidakis held a lecture at the center's launching ceremony, titled Philosophy is a Way of Life. Philosophy is not just theory, he said, noting that in ancient Greece and China it didn't mean just making theories about the universe, nature, god, or much of the unknown world. ""It told you how to 'organize' your life to feel happy and achieve harmony with others."" Western philosophy cannot be understood just by itself as there are also Chinese and Indian schools of philosophy among others. ""It is easier to see some similarities in ideas between Confucius and Socrates or Confucius and Aristotle,"" said Virvidakis, explaining why he is so fond of Chinese philosophy, especially Confucius thought. A simple question about what is a good life has a variety of answers in different philosophical theories.  But studying philosophy is practical and a way of life. Modern people don't just derive happiness from materialism. They need art and other emotionally stirring elements in life. In different parts and different cultures of the world,people can share similarities in emotion and sentiment.Virvidakis said that one of the most important reasons for his involving in such studies and exchanges was because ""I'm interested and I want to learn more. I'm a student too. When you are a teacher in your whole life, you're going to be a student.""",ARTS,CULTURE & LEISURE,The University of Athens Photo: VCG,"Reporter, Beijing","Global Times senior reporter, mainly covers the reporting of movies, TV, music and culture news.",43,880,<FreqDist with 16 samples and 473 outcomes>

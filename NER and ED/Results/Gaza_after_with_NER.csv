2,"Two-State solution only way to break vicious cycle of Israel-Palestine conflict, eliminate the breeding ground of extremist ideologies: Wang Yi",Global Times,2024-03-07,"There is no distinction between noble and humble lives, and people should not be unfavorably labeled according to their race or religion. The failure to end the humanitarian disaster caused by the Palestinian-Israeli Conflict today in the 21st century is a tragedy for humanity and a disgrace for civilization, said China Foreign Minister Wang Yi on Thursday.Nothing justifies the protraction of the conflict, or the killing of the civilian population, Wang stressed when holding a press conference on Thursday on the sidelines of the second session of the 14th National People's Congress.The current conflict has caused more than 100,000 civilian casualties, he noted.The international community must act urgently to reach an immediate cease-fire and an end to the fighting an overriding priority, and to ensure that humanitarian assistance is an urgent moral imperative. The people of Gaza have a right to survive in this world, and the women and children deserve to be cared for by their loved ones, the China foreign minister said.The long occupation of the Palestine territories and the long-cherished aspiration of the Palestine for an independent state should not be ignored anymore. More importantly, the historical injustice suffered by the Palestine must not be allowed to continue uncorrected generation after generation, Wang stated.He called for restoring justice to the Palestine people and fully implementing the two-State solution, which is the only way to break the vicious cycle of Palestinian-Israeli Conflict conflicts, to eliminate the breeding ground of extremist ideologies, and to realize enduring peace in the Middle East.China firmly supports the just cause of the Palestine people to restore their legitimate national rights, and has always been committed to a comprehensive, just and lasting settlement of the Palestine issue, stated Wang.""We support Palestine's bid to become a full member state of the UN and call on individual UN members to stop obstructing this process. We propose that a larger, more authoritative and more effective international peace conference be convened to draw up a road map and timetable for the implementation of the two-State solution. China will continue to work with the international community to restore peace, save lives and uphold justice,"" Wang said.

3,Biden to deliver State of the Union address,GT staff reporters,2024-03-07,"US President Joe Biden is expected to deliver his State of the Union address on Thursday night local time, right after former US president Donald Trump became the sole remaining major candidate for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination. Describing the address as ""what could be the most consequential speech of Joe Biden's presidency,"" US media outlet CNN expected Joe Biden to tout his economic record, talk about the failed border deal and abortion rights to provide a contrast with Donald Trump, defend the US' role abroad, and warn about democracy and threats in the country. Although Joe Biden will command the attention on the night of what might be the largest television audience before November, the speech will likely be rather defensive in nature, considering that the Joe Biden administration does not have many achievements to boast about, experts said. Joe Biden is likely to focus his speech on boosting domestic confidence, emphasizing his government's achievements and plans in the economy and stock market, Lü Xiang, a research fellow at the China Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times on Thursday. In terms of foreign policy, Russia is likely to be a major topic. Joe Biden is also expected to address support for Israel and immigration issues, Lü said. However, the expert highly doubted that the confidence of the US people could be restored by just one speech. A number of surveys showed the US public's strong disapproval of the state of the economy, something Joe Biden has struggled to wrap his head around, according to CNN. The speech comes right after former US president Donald Trump became the sole remaining major candidate for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination, after his main opponent Nikki Haley announced her exit from the election on Wednesday. Donald Trump, who won 14 of 15 states' primaries on Super Tuesday, and Joe Biden, who swept all 15 states on that day, are well on their way to becoming the 2024 presidential nominees in their respective parties. A number of US media outlets pointed out that the speech will give Joe Biden a chance to draw a contrast with Donald Trump by focusing on issues he believes will win over more voters. He will also be working to show voters concerned about his age that at 81, he is still rigorous enough for the job, NPR reported on Wednesday. However, observers suggest that Joe Biden's performance in this State of the Union address is unlikely to have a significantly positive impact on his re-election prospects. ""If this were a year ago, a good State of the Union speech might have helped his public approval ratings, but not now,"" Lü said. In fact, Joe Biden's previous two State of the Union addresses during his term did not have a positive effect either.Joe Biden had a very positive image when he first took office, but his honeymoon period ended after a few months, while his public approval ratings quickly dropped to below 45 percent in 2022 and never returned to previous levels. The majority of US losing confidence in both of the main presidential prospects indicated that the democratic system that the US prides itself on has shown significant flaws, observers noted, as the public is stuck with an unsatisfactory gerontocracy.""The two-party system in the US has become strange and abnormal, and is stuck in a sluggish state. The issues in the electoral system are a microcosm of US politics,"" Lü said.Later on Thursday after Joe Biden's speech, Republican Senator Katie Britt will deliver the Republican response, as per the annual tradition.",CHINA,DIPLOMACY,"US President Joe Biden speaks during a meeting of his Competition Council in the White House in Washington on March 5, 2024.

4,Houthi attacks in Red Sea reports first fatalities as regional conflict escalates,Fan Anqi,2024-03-07,"A Houthi missile attack on a merchant ship in the Gulf of Aden killed at least three seafarers, the first fatalities reported since the Yemeni military group began attacking Israel-linked ships in the Red Sea, media reported on Wednesday. China experts said the root cause for the conflict overspill fundamentally lies with the US and its suppression of Palestine's legitimate rights and interests. The Houthis claimed responsibility for the attack on Wednesday, which set ablaze the Liberian-owned, Barbados-flagged ship True Confidence, killing at least three and injuring four, of which three are in critical condition, according to media reports. Among the victims, two of the deceased and two of the severely injured have been confirmed as Filipino crewmen, the Philippine Department of Migrant Workers announced on Thursday.The deadly strike is seen by China observers as an escalation in regional conflict, but does not necessarily signify a significant turning point. Following this incident, the US and UK may use it as a pretext to launch further military actions against Houthi forces, including increased military operations and media suppression, Zhu Yongbiao, director of the Center for Afghanistan Studies at Lanzhou University, told the Global Times on Thursday. The US and UK have launched a series of airstrikes against Houthis in the past few days in an attempt to deter the militia from exacerbating the situation in one of the world's most important shipping lanes.However, analysts said the strikes will only bring more conflicts to the region, as well as new challenges to the fragile global economic recovery, especially for those economies that have suffered from serious inflation and heavily rely on energy supplies from the Middle East via the Red Sea.The current turmoil in the Middle East is primarily attributed to the unjust interference of major powers, Zhu said. The US, as a significant player in the region, has long been supporting Israel, which has been a fundamental cause of the prolonged unresolved issues in the Middle East. In addition, Palestine were denied of their legitimate demands and rights, particularly their right to establish a state, Zhu said, and this deliberate neglect and suppression have led to the tragic escalation of conflict.The expert said that the deadly attack by the Houthi rebels is to some extent part of the ongoing efforts to coordinate with Hamas to exert pressure on the US and accelerate the cease-fire deal it brokered and make the deal more favorable for Palestine. However, the current deal is facing significant disagreements and has stalled once again, making it even more unlikely to be reached before the start of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan - the informal deadline for the deal.Three days of negotiations with Hamas over the cease-fire in Gaza have failed to achieve a breakthrough, Al Jazeera reported on Tuesday. However, the US insisted on Wednesday that a truce accord before Ramadan is still possible.The likelihood of its passage depends largely on how much the US hopes to gain political points, particularly in the upcoming presidential elections, through the achievement of such an agreement. This will determine the extent of effort the US is willing to put in and the pressure it will exert on both parties, Zhu noted. The US blocked forcibly, for the fourth time, a cease-fire resolution at the UN on Tuesday. Geng Shuang, China's deputy permanent representative to the UN, said the results of the vote clearly showed that the vast majority of Council members are unanimous on the issue of a cease-fire in Gaza, while the US exclusively abused its veto power to stifle the Council's consensus, which has caused widespread discontent in the international community.",CHINA,DIPLOMACY,A container ship sails in the Red Sea in the Straits of Tiran in 2023.

7,China expresses disappointment after US used veto on a cease-fire in Gaza for a fourth time,Global Times,2024-03-06,"China is deeply disappointed that the UN's call for a cease-fire had been forcibly blocked by the United States for a fourth time, Geng Shuang, China's deputy permanent representative to the UN, said in a statement on Tuesday.  As the Muslim holy month of Ramadan approaches, the international community must push for an immediate cease-fire and an end to the conflict with the strongest sense of urgency and the greatest political determination.According to the statement, the current results of the Council's vote clearly show that the vast majority of Council members are unanimous on the issue of a cease-fire in Gaza, while the US exclusively abused its veto power to stifle the Council's consensus, which has caused widespread discontent in the international community. Geng said that the immediate cease-fire in Gaza is necessary to save innocent civilians, a prerequisite for humanitarian relief and a key to avoid further escalation and proliferation of the conflict. International community has to push for an immediate cease-fire to preserve the hope of survival for the people of Gaza. ""We urge Israel to immediately reverse its course, cancel its plan of attack on Rafah, stop its military assault on Gaza and end its forced transfer and collective punishment of the Palestine community,""  Geng said. ""We call on the countries concerned to put aside geostrategic and domestic political considerations, to be truly impartial and responsible, and to make the right choice and play a constructive role in promoting a cease-fire in Gaza.""Gaza, which remains under fire, is facing an unprecedented humanitarian disaster, with extreme shortages of survival supplies. Nearly 600,000 people are on the brink of starvation and social order is on the verge of collapse. Geng said that China urges Israel, as the occupying party, to fulfill its obligations under international law by guaranteeing the safe, rapid and unimpeded entry of sufficient humanitarian supplies and by taking practical measures to safeguard the safety of humanitarian agencies and personnel and provide them with the necessary facilities to carry out their relief work. Geng said that resolutions 2712 and 2720 adopted by the Council must be fully implemented.Geng emphasized that the two-state solution is the only viable way to resolve the Hamas-Israel conflict. The recent public rejection of the two-state solution by some Israel political figures and the rejection of any international efforts to realize an independent Palestine State are alarming. ""China calls for intensified international and regional diplomatic efforts to reshape a credible multilateral process, revitalize the political prospects for the two-state solution and restart direct negotiations between Palestine and Israel,"" Geng said. ""We advocate the convening of an international peace conference of greater scale, scope and effectiveness. We support Palestine's full membership in the UN as soon as possible.""China will continue to work with the international community to maintain unremitting efforts to put an end to the fighting in Gaza, and alleviate the humanitarian disaster, to implement the two-state solution and to realize long-term peace and security in the Middle East, Geng said.Global Times",CHINA,DIPLOMACY,"People check the rubble of a building destroyed in an Israeli air strike in the southern Gaza Strip city of Rafah, on Feb. 16, 2024.

8,Why public trust in politicians hits spectacular low in the UK,Mark Blacklock,2024-03-06," Nobody who has watched British civic life in recent years will have been in the least bit surprised that a recent study by the country's Office for National Statistics (ONS) has found only 12 percent of the public trust their politicians, a spectacular low. People feel increasingly alienated from those who are supposed to have been elected to represent their interests. Worse, they feel unable to influence the heedless parliamentary apparatus which seems to be being used to serving the politicians more than it serves the people.The job of the ONS is to gather, process and analyze data about the United Kingdom's economy, society and population, and is widely regarded as a professional and impartial authority. This makes the findings of its annual Trust in Government survey so striking. The collapse in trust in political parties is an unimpressive 12 percent this year, which is down from an already lamentable 20 percent in the previous analysis. The proportion of adults trusting the government itself also fell - from 35 percent to 27 percent - and trust in parliament, the institution where the politicians operate, plummeted from 34 percent to 24 percent. These figures echo a study from a market research company last year, which said only 9 percent of people trusted their politicians to tell the truth (the lowest level in 40 years). The inevitable conclusion to be drawn is that most Britons think that the political class that has the power to make decisions that control their lives are liars.One reason the UK public is so disillusioned with their politics is the prevailing doctrine which favors political centrism. Party leaders are reluctant to appear too leftist or rightist for fear of driving support away, so they gravitate toward the center. These are not the politics of conviction or ideology, but of opportunity for self-serving individuals who are willing to change their policies and even opinions to give themselves the best chance of winning. A general election is expected in Britain this year, in a country that has essentially been a two-party system for generations. The Conservative and Labour parties are electorally dominant and regularly alternate in government, largely because of the country's outdated, unfair and anti-democratic first-past-the-post electoral system, which works to marginalize and exclude voices outside of the center. This makes it difficult for other relevant parties, such as the Greens and especially smaller groups such as communists, to be represented in Westminster.This feeling of alienation from the process of government is exacerbated by the closeness of the two main parties. At the election, there will be little to choose between the main party's candidates in important aspects of policy. In fact, Rishi Sunak's Tories and Keir Starmer's Labour have recently accused each of stealing the other's policies and mimicking standpoints. Neither of them spoke out against the war in Gaza, for example, until it had been raging for months. Both parties have declared support for rules that prevent families from receiving a state benefit for more than two children - something that affects many low-income households.At the other extreme, both parties are prepared to lift a cap on bankers' bonuses - something which was devised to discourage reckless investment behavior - and allow them to make unlimited payments. Both parties have also declared the need to continue with austerity-style policies which are blamed for the declining nature of Britain's economy. Both parties favor cracking down on illegal immigration, and approve of higher defense spending, keeping the Trident nuclear deterrent (despite a recent failed test-firing of one of the ￡17m missiles) and continued support for Ukraine.If the people, despairing at the lack of choice among those who seek to govern them, should dare to speak out and protest, the establishment has been devoting a lot of time and effort into devising laws aimed at discouraging and restricting demonstrations. The temperature has been further raised by the politicians themselves complaining that the strength of dissent has put them in danger. They call protest marches ""hate marches."" If there is one that the people hate, it is being lied to and not being served by those whose job it is to serve them. And that is why so few people trust or believe them.The author is a journalist and lecturer living in Britain. opinion@globaltimes.com.cn",OPINION,VIEWPOINT,UK Illustration: Chen Xia/GT,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'British': ('MISC', 1), 'Brito': ('MISC', 1), 'Conservative': ('MISC', 1), 'Office for National Statistics': ('ORG', 1), 'ONS': ('ORG', 2), 'Trust in Government': ('ORG', 1), 'Labour': ('ORG', 1), 'Greens': ('ORG', 1), 'Westminster': ('ORG', 1), 'United Kingdom': ('LOC', 1), 'UK': ('LOC', 1), 'Britain': ('LOC', 1)}"
9,"Harris' rebuke of Israel lays bare 
'embarrassment of Biden admin'",Fan Anqi,2024-03-05,"In what appears to be ""the strongest rebuke"" of its close ally made yet by a senior leader in the US government, Vice President Kamala Harris on Sunday bluntly called out Israel for the ""inhuman"" conditions it has caused that made Gaza a ""humanitarian catastrophe,"" according to media reports.Harris urged an ""immediate cease-fire"" in Gaza for at least the next six weeks, a deal that White House officials said Israel is close to accepting. ""The Israel government must do more to significantly increase the flow of aid. No excuses,"" the US' No.2 political figure said.However, according to a local newspaper, Israel boycotted Gaza cease-fire talks in Cairo on Sunday, citing reasons from Hamas over a list of hostages.On the same day, Israel strike on an aid distribution truck carrying food to displaced Gaza residents killed at least nine people and wounded many others, Al Jazeera reported.""The latest episode has shown just how embarrassing the situation is now for the Joe Biden administration, which gives people the impression that US policy-makers are having 'mental disorders'…if they keep sticking up for Israel despite global outrage, it will further tarnishing the image of the US, and more importantly, losing the Saudi Arabia-US voters in key swing states as Joe Biden seeks re-election,"" Li Haidong, a professor at the China Foreign Affairs University, told the Global Times on Monday. While Harris' call is seen as a desperate attempt to try and ""stop the bleeding"" from yet another major misstep in the incumbent's foreign policy, Joe Biden has found it hard to rein in Israel, Li said. ""The world is watching the power play between these two strange bedfellows.""Lü Xiang, a research fellow at the China Academy of Social Sciences, added that the internal spat over Gaza issue indicates that the US is struggling with resource allocation because they do not have enough to support the simultaneous mobilization of several pawns, including Israel in the Middle East, Ukraine against Russia and China's Taiwan. The insufficiency has led to voices within the Democrats to drop the current Israel policy, while giving the Republican a weapon to attack Joe Biden for being weak, Lü noted. Harris' comments came just two days ahead of ""Super Tuesday,"" which is considered one of the most important dates on the US political calendar when the largest number of states will hold their presidential primaries and caucuses.During the Democratic primary in Michigan last week, more than 100,000 voters cast a vote for ""uncommitted"" in a ground-breaking move to denounce Joe Biden's ""unwavering"" support for Israel.Although this ""Super Tuesday"" seems exceptionally insignificant as the presidential candidates of both parties have already become evident, this round of elections will serve as a crucial indicator for the official showdown between the two at the end of the year, experts said. Judging by a new poll by The New York Times and Siena College, Joe Biden trails behind former US president Donald Trump by five percent in the national survey of registered voters.""Joe Biden's campaign does not look promising. It is sad that Joe Biden's foreign policy, which had been regarded an advantage of his over Donald Trump, has now become his biggest liability. Starting from the Afghan troop withdrawal, to the Ukraine crisis and now the Gaza crisis, each decision he made resulted in a decline of his approval ratings,"" Lü said. In contrast, Donald Trump is taking the lead in almost every topic of the election race, experts noted. Furthermore, despite being embroiled in legal battles, Donald Trump is using this to promote conspiracy theories by portraying himself as a ""victim"" and rallying support among grassroots Republican voters, thus weakening challengers within the party, while gaining sympathy votes from outside the party.No matter who wins the final race, Li said, the US' foreign policy is always a result of political infighting, featuring a high degree of instability in handling global affairs. The toxic environment of opposition and confrontation in its domestic politics will risk paralyzing the whole international affairs in which the US interferes, the expert warned.",CHINA,POLITICS,"The Nasser Hospital is seen in the southern Gaza Strip city of Khan Younis, Feb. 28, 2024.

Of special interest for me will also be to learn what the idea of building ""new quality productive forces"" will actually mean, since the China economy is already the locomotive of the world economy. Mankind is clearly at a branching point. Since geopolitics is the curse of history, I am hopeful that China's two sessions will show a pathway for the world, and help the world understand how to overcome the mistaken view that a country or a group of countries must defend its interests against another group by all means. It is quite possible for China to establish a new paradigm, where the interests of all can be taken care of. That is a new system, which allows for the development of all.Global Times: What is the significance of the political gathering amid rising global headwinds? And from your perspective, what role will China and the China economy play in the world this year?HZL: China foreign policy has proven to be an anchor of stability. The biggest danger now is the two regional conflicts: the Russia-Ukraine conflict and the Israel-Palestine conflict. And China has made comprehensive diplomatic proposals for both crises, showing the path to a peaceful solution. The extension of the China-proposed BRI (BRI) could play a decisive role in reconstruction for the countries involved in conflict in the context of a regional development perspective. The Schiller Institute has also proposed a concrete economic development plan, the Oasis plan, which could bring peace for all countries involved.Global Times: From your perspective, what will be the focal points of China's economic work this year? What are your estimates for key economic figures that will be set during the two sessions?HZL: The economic work focus this year will be on boosting high technology, high efficiency and high quality of production. Given the high number of scientists and engineers China has, and the addition of around 11 million university graduates per year, the transformation of basic scientific and technological breakthroughs into real production in the China economy will be very significant. Global Times: What role do you expect the China economy to play in the world this year, amid the complex geopolitical situation? HZL: There have been increasing tendencies of decoupling and ""de-risking,"" which really amount to the same thing. When the EU is preparing tax barriers against China imports, they are further isolating themselves to their own detriment. I expect China to be a strong advocate for multilateralism, and to build cooperation with the Global South, where there have been tremendous efforts in transforming from exports of raw materials toward economic models based on the value chain. Also, naturally the BRICS-Plus - of which China is a founding member - will gain increasing importance this year, and include new credit mechanisms that promote development for all participants. Global Times: The BRI is also high on the agenda of the two sessions. From your perspective, how will China chart a new BRI blueprint in the 11th year of its development?HZL: Since the development requirements of the Global South are gigantic, in the next decade, the China-proposed BRI offers plenty of opportunities for all nations to work together for their mutual benefit. And if all countries can bear in mind such a perspective, the next decade of the BRI can unleash the creative potential of billions of people.In terms of EU countries, especially Germany and France, they are experiencing a dramatic economic slowdown. So hopefully there will be a greater openness to respond to what the BRI has to offer.",SOURCE,ECONOMY,Two Sessions Photo:Xinhua,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'China': ('LOC', 14), 'Russia': ('LOC', 1), 'Ukraine': ('LOC', 1), 'Israel': ('LOC', 1), 'Palestine': ('LOC', 1), 'Global Times': ('ORG', 2), 'HZL': ('ORG', 1), 'Schiller Institute': ('ORG', 2), 'BRI': ('ORG', 2), 'Sc': ('ORG', 1), 'O': ('ORG', 1), 'Li Xuanmin': ('PER', 1), 'Helga Zepp - LaRouche': ('PER', 1), 'Germany': ('MISC', 1), 'Times': ('MISC', 2)}"
11,China's support of global governance fits with its sense of history,Global Times,2024-03-05,"Editor's Note:China's annual two sessions began this week. This critical series of meetings in spring is vital to defining China's approach to economic, political and foreign policy issues for the whole year. It also offers observers a window into the latest ideas and practices of China's development in various aspects, including the whole-process people's democracy, high-quality development, China modernization and the wisdom the country provides to global governance. The Global Times selected the opinions of foreign scholars to shed light on these concepts.Kerry Brown, professor of China Studies and director of the Lau China Institute at King's College, LondonChina's path to modernization in the last half a century has had the advantage of being able to observe what other countries, including the US, EU countries and Japan, did earlier in their programs to change their economies and develop. What China did over this period is, as the phrase in the late 1970s put it, emancipating the mind, seeking truth from facts and keeping pace with the times. It adopted a pragmatic approach and one that allowed many different ideas about how to develop itself to be tried and tested, for example, township and village enterprises. These were tried in some places and then when they showed potential, were promoted in others, to the point that they became national policy. So China was very open-minded about what models it took from the outside world, but it also made sure these were adapted to the unique situation within the country. This was mostly about acknowledging the scale and diversity of China, a country that is continental in size and complexity. I think this made the China experience very different than anywhere else. It was a remarkable mixture of the local and the international.The changes in China over the past 40 years as ""earth-shattering."" The main change has been in people's material living standards. At the start of 1978, per capita GDP was about $190. Today it is coming close to about $12,000. That means immense changes in people's general living standards. Over the last 40 years, more people than ever before have seen their living standards generally increase in China. The changes show themselves in the infrastructure the country has, and the remarkable transformation of its population from a largely rural living one to one where more than half are now living in cities. Broadly, this has been achieved by flexible policy-making and in the early decades by the government allowing space for innovation and Improvisation. It has also been nurtured by a huge desire among the China people themselves to see their living situation change and improve. China has a unique identity - like everywhere else. While China has taken many ideas in the last decades from the outside world to develop itself and its economy, it has also remained at its core culturally very distinctive. This means that successful engagement with China means acknowledging its differences, but being respectful of that. It also means embracing a China which often is coming from a different background and thinking in a slightly different way. Martin Albrow, an eminent British sociologist and one of the first globalization theoristsChina has got a very unique and well-developed system of consultative democracy, which means that people can engage with the policies of the government at every level of society, and they are being consulted at every level. I think the notion of consultative democracy is actually very appropriate for the current age. Most countries in the world, and most people in the world accept concepts such as the BRI (BR) as very fine concepts. I think the countries that obviously adopt the most will be the ones that have already benefited from the BRI. As most countries in the world have now benefited from the Belt and Road, they obviously will see a shared future as an example of the way China reaches out through its relations with other countries. China is very much in favor of global institutions and global governance, and it does everything it can to support them. It fits with China's own sense of history. It fits with the idea of the middle kingdom, because it builds relationships through the world as a whole. And global governance, as we know it today, is bringing people together with shared values and shared purposes, like the Millennium Development Goals. If you belong to the UN, you belong to that mission to save the world. So I think it fits very neatly with China history. China must take the leading role in bringing peace and harmony as far as possible in all the troubled spots of the world, and that includes Israel, Ukraine and Yemen. All the troubled spots are the areas where China diplomacy has got to be very active in trying to create peace because peace is obviously in the best interests of the world.",OPINION,VIEWPOINT,Photo: VCG,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'China': ('LOC', 10), ""' s"": ('LOC', 1), 'LondonChina': ('LOC', 1), 'US': ('LOC', 1), 'Japan': ('LOC', 1), 'Global Times': ('ORG', 1), 'China Studies': ('ORG', 1), 'Lau China Institute': ('ORG', 1), 'King': ('ORG', 1), 'College': ('ORG', 1), 'EU': ('ORG', 1), 'Kerry Brown': ('PER', 1)}"

14,"In 2024, what is the human rights issue that deserves the most attention?",Global Times,2024-03-05,"At a recent session of the UN Human Rights Council (UNHRC), Volker Türk, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, claimed there was a violation of human rights in China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region and Xizang Autonomous Region, after gently touching upon the actual massive human rights crisis in Gaza. Even worse, the West media almost only covered his remarks on China. If there is any takeaway from this news story, it is that neither the UNHRC nor West media have done their job properly. Türk said he called on the China government to implement the recommendations made by his office and other human rights bodies in relation to ""laws, policies and practices that violate fundamental rights, including in the Xinjiang and Tibet regions."" ""I particularly encourage revision of the vague offence of 'picking quarrels and making trouble' in Article 293 of the Criminal Law, and I urge the release of human rights defenders, lawyers and others detained under such legislation,"" he added.  The title of his full speech on UN website is ""Türk's global update to the Human Rights Council."" Although he also raised concerns on the war in Gaza, as well as human rights issues in other countries, West media's headlines only focused on China, with one even saying ""UN rights chief says China committing violations in Xinjiang, Tibet."" Some media outlets mentioned Turk's predecessor Michelle Bachelet, who released a report just minutes before her term ended in 2022, which cited possible ""crimes against humanity"" in Xinjiang. ""But it stopped short of labelling Beijing's actions in Xinjiang a 'genocide,' as the US and some West lawmakers have done,"" they noted. Both UN high commissioners for Human Rights keep the label ""genocide"" at arm's length for a reason - this accusation is completely unfounded. If a UN human rights chief ever claim there is ""genocide"" in Xinjiang, that act would be equivalent to imposing an unjustified charge on a permanent member of the UN. That would be a risky move - like playing with fire - in terms of the post-war international order maintained by the UN, and could lead to the organization's division, Zhu Ying, a professor at the Baize Institute at the Southwest University of Political Science and Law, told the Global Times. Blindly following the dogma of the US and the West in their pursuit of hegemony will only weaken the authority of the UN, Zhu added.So Türk technically turned to other targets, like Article 293 of China's Criminal Law. To make a clarification first, Article 293 stipulates that ""whoever commits any of the following acts of creating disturbances, thus disrupting public order,"" shall face legal consequence, and the acts include ""beating another person at will and to a flagrant extent,"" ""creating disturbances in a public place, thus causing serious disorder in such place"" and so on.   In other words, those who have been arrested posed danger to the safety of others and social order. It is by no means a systematic human rights violations or suppression, as hinted by Türk. Kishore Mahbubani, a Singapore-based scholar and former diplomat, rebutted such West distorted perspectives as early as 2021. ""If the Communist Party of China only relied on repression to stay in power, it would not create the most dynamic economy in the world,"" he said. By making those comments on China's human rights, Türk not only directly interfered in China's legislative sovereignty, but also revealed his lack of understanding of China's criminal justice system. China legal experts have been constantly promoting the country's human rights protection and adjusting laws and regulations, Zhu told the Global Times. Xinjiang and Tibet are taking the lead in key indexes of economic growth nationwide. The living standards of the people in these regions are constantly improving. The education sector has achieved high-quality development, and the issue of scarce and uneven education resources has been efficiently resolved. Deputies and representatives from the two autonomous regions have also brought a variety of proposals to the two sessions, including ways to promote the animal husbandry, foster important supply bases for high-quality agricultural and animal husbandry products nationwide, promote local employment, further expand the scope of reimbursement for rural medical insurance for villagers, and accelerating the construction of free trade pilot zones. The China government and local authorities are sparing no effort in boosting the dynamic of the region and improving quality of life there. However, West officials and media outlets, living in a bubble of specific ideological and West-centric discourse system, keep shrieking their unfounded denunciations. It is unwise and short-sighted for the UN human rights chief to target the practice of China's criminal law in order to knit some human rights accusations, Zhu said. Türk may as well pay more attention to whether West countries have done a proper job in protecting their own human rights in practice.More ironically, as smearing on Xinjiang and Xizang becomes increasingly blatant, the West is turning a blind eye, even indulging the violence and bloodshed in Gaza. ""In 2024, any discussion of human rights violation that does not include or touches gently on Gaza, where even the UN has described as carnage, lacks credibility,"" Shen Yi, a professor at Fudan University, told the Global Times.",OPINION,OBSERVER,Western smear Illustration: Liu Rui/GT,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'UN Human Rights Council': ('ORG', 8), 'UNHRC': ('ORG', 2), 'Human Rights': ('ORG', 2), 'Human Rights Council': ('ORG', 1), 'Institute': ('ORG', 1), 'Times': ('ORG', 1), 'Volker Türk': ('PER', 3), 'Turk': ('PER', 1), 'Michelle Bachelet': ('PER', 1), 'Xiang': ('PER', 1), 'Zhu Ying': ('PER', 1), 'Bai': ('PER', 1), 'China': ('LOC', 5), 'Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region': ('LOC', 5), 'Xizang Autonomous Region': ('LOC', 1), 'Gaza': ('LOC', 2), 'Tibet': ('LOC', 2), 'Beijing': ('LOC', 1), 'US': ('LOC', 2), 'Southwest': ('LOC', 1), 'West': ('MISC', 5), 'Article 293': ('MISC', 1), 'Criminal Law': ('MISC', 1)}"
16,Two sessions offer good insights into China’s development paradigm: Thai scholar,Global Times,2024-03-04,"Editor's Note:This week, China kicked off the two sessions, one of the most important political gatherings annually. The event offers an important window for the outside world to understand China's development, and where the world's second-largest economy is headed and top policy priorities in 2024. What are the world's general expectations of the two sessions? And how do foreign economists and think tanks view China's growth potential? Recently, Global Times reporter Li Xuanmin (Global Times) conducted an interview with Wirun Phichaiwongphakdee (Wirun), director of the Thailand-China Research Center of the BRI and a researcher at the Thailand-China Strategic Research Center at the National Research Institute of Thailand.   Global Times: What are your expectations of the two sessions?Wirun: I am eagerly looking forward to everything about China's economy at the two sessions, especially the focus and direction of China's economic development in 2024. I hope to see clear economic policies from China, which will also establish a direction for the economic and trade cooperation between Asia, particularly Southeast Asian countries, and China. The timing of the two sessions is very important. It is being held at a time when the global economy is currently facing the impacts of the post-pandemic era, with West trade protectionism, technological barriers, and turbulent regional situations all posing challenges to global economic growth. Since most Asian countries have long been export-oriented, so a recession in the West economy would have a certain level of impact on all Asian countries. Against the backdrop, it is important to strengthen economic ties among all Asian economies.Global Times: What is the significance of the two sessions to the world? And what kind of message will they send to global observers?  Wirun: Currently, the world has come to a threshold period for a leap in productivity, and the development of artificial intelligence (AI) will lead humanity into a new stage. China is one of the first countries to elevate innovation to the level of national development, stressing that innovation is the key to grasping and leading the era. China also put forward the concept of ""new quality productive forces,"" which is vital to economic growth and a development paradigm that other countries could draw upon.It is evident that the era of competition for resources based on zero-sum thinking has passed, and that interconnectivity and mutual beneficial cooperation represents the mainstream of world development. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken recently used an US slang to sum up US thinking that ""if you're not at the table in the international system, you're going to be on the menu,"" when responding to a moderator's question concerning that ""the US-China tensions are leading to greater fragmentation."" His answer, which has received a tsunami of criticism, exemplifies the West's blatant zero-sum thinking. It is believed that China's wisdom and peaceful solution to global issues would provide insights to the world. China's strong objection to the Cold War mentality, advocacy for peaceful coexistence, mutual benefit, and the ideas of building a community with shared future, are all manifested in China's diplomatic practices. China's efforts in seeking peaceful resolutions to the Russia-Ukraine conflict and the Israel-Palestine conflict are well recognized. Global Times: From your perspective, what will be the focal point of China's economic work in 2024?Wirun: China's economic work focus in 2024 is likely to concentrate on expanding domestic demand, shoring up exports, as well as addressing local government debt. It should be recognized that the relatively high level of local government debt is an inevitable phase in the process of industrialization and urbanization. And I believe that with the China government's efficient macro-control capabilities, the authorities will be able to guide local governments to gradual shift away from reliance on real estate income.Furthermore, efforts should be made to boost economic vitality, restore investor confidence, and promote investment mechanisms in the innovation sector. If China can maintain a moderate GDP growth during its economic transitioning period in 2024, it would be a significant achievement. I also suggest China establish a smoother and closer economic cycle with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). In fact, Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia are huge consumer markets, and the resource endowments of these countries are complementary to China. The implementation of visa-free policies between China and many ASEAN members is also an important step in this direction.Global Times: How do you see China's economic outlook this year? And what role do you expect it to play in the global development?Wirun: As the world's second-largest economy, China has a pivotal impact on the global economy. China's innovation in the field of AI will contribute significantly to the leap in human productivity. China has been gradually opening up its financial markets, including banking and insurance, which I believe will be the next hotspot for attracting foreign investment. This opening-up not only demonstrates China's commitment to integrating into the global economic system but also offers tremendous opportunities for international investors looking to enter the vast and growing China market.",SOURCE,ECONOMY,A view of Shanghai Photo: VCG,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'China': ('LOC', 9), 'Thailand': ('LOC', 1), 'Asia': ('LOC', 1), 'West': ('LOC', 2), 'US': ('LOC', 1), 'Global Times': ('ORG', 4), 'Wirun': ('ORG', 1), 'Thailand - China Research Center': ('ORG', 1), 'BRI': ('ORG', 1), 'Thailand - China Strategic Research Center': ('ORG', 1), 'National Research Institute of': ('ORG', 1), 'Li Xuanmin': ('PER', 1), 'Wirun Phichaiwongphakdee': ('PER', 1), 'Antony': ('PER', 1), 'Times': ('MISC', 2), 'Southeast Asian': ('MISC', 4)}"

18,Consultative democracy means people can engage with policies at every level of society,Global Times,2024-03-03,"Editor's Note:China's annual two sessions begin this week. This critical series of meetings in spring is vital to defining China's approach to economic, political and foreign policy issues for the whole year. It also offers observers a window into the latest ideas and practices of China's development in various aspects, including the whole-process people's democracy, high-quality development, China modernization and the wisdom the country provides to global governance.In the first piece of the series ""Two sessions inspirations,"" Martin Albrow (Albrow), an eminent British sociologist and one of the first globalization theorists, shared his insights on China's democratic model with Global Times (Global Times) reporter Wang Zixuan.Global Times: You have visited China many times and have studied China's development and its system. What is your understanding of China's whole-process people's democracy? What do you think about the significance of the two sessions and their decisions for the China government and people?Albrow: I think China has got a very unique and well-developed system of consultative democracy, which means that people can engage with the policies of the government at every level of society, and they are being consulted at every level. I think the notion of consultative democracy is actually very appropriate for the current age. The main model in the West is one that very frequently leads to disaster, and they are very close to a disaster at the moment. Of course, the worst disaster with democracy in the West was in the 20th century, when Adolf Hitler was elected democratically in Germany. Look what happened after that, he became the worst dictator the world has ever known. So, the West style of democracy can work well, but it's a far riskier model than the China one and the China one is well suited to China. Historically, China's development is very much a form of hierarchical government where people can be consulted and they can voice their opinions at every level.Global Times: You have mentioned that the China version of democracy is ""very different from the kinds which exist in so many West countries."" What misconceptions does the West have about China's democracy? Why are these misconceptions difficult to change?Albrow: The main reason is because it is managed by the Communist Party of China. And there are many people in the West who have a feeling of great hostility toward communism, particularly in the US. I'm proud to call myself a friend of China, but I have a very close old friend and he has a friend who says to him, ""Martin is a traitor,"" simply because I'm a friend of China. There are other historical reasons why there is hostility toward China. Some of them are very much to the discredit of the West. The UK did terrible things to China in the 19th century. What impresses me when I come to China is how wonderfully welcoming China people are. I can't explain just why it is that China people are so generous, but they are.

British sociologist Martin Albrow Photo: XinhuaGT: Why don't the US and other West countries focus more on remedying their own systemic deficiencies, instead of constantly attacking China-style democracy?Albrow: That comes down to geopolitics and the fact that in any political system, I'm talking about a system where there is competition for power, the leading power country will always be threatened by the rise of another country. This has nothing to do with communism. This has to do with the dynamics of geopolitics. This is sometimes called the Thucydides Trap. The Thucydides Trap was proposed by a Greek historian who said that the rise of Sparta was regarded as a great threat to Athens, irrespective of the fact that they could coexist. In other words, the one on top will feel threatened by the one that is rising. It's as simple as that. Now, if you add that to the fear of communism, you can understand why geopolitics today is in a very unstable situation.Global Times: As a well-known sociologist, what is the significance of China-style democracy for the development of democratic politics in the world?Albrow: One suggestion I have made before is that the Communist Party of China could make more efforts to be in touch with what is called civil society in the West. It does make good contact with communist parties in the West, but communist parties in the West are in a very different position from the Communist Party of China.So you have to think about what elements in the China system would also be in the West system and could be receptive to and interested in good relations with the party. Those will be mainly civil society groups, like the Friends of the Earth, which are concerned with climate change, or those organizations that are concerned with refugees. If the CPC could reach out to those organizations, I think it would be very beneficial for the world.Global Times: You have highly praised the idea of a global community of shared future and the China-proposed BRI (BRI). What kind of development and governance philosophy of China do these ideas reflect? Why have they been widely welcomed by the international community?Albrow: I would say most countries in the world, and most people in the world accept these concepts as very fine concepts. I think the countries that obviously adopt the most will be the ones that have already benefited from the BRI. As most countries in the world have now benefited from the Belt and Road, they obviously will see a shared future as an example of the way China reaches out through its relations with other countries. The countries that are not enthusiastic will be the ones that are very close to the US and regard the BRI as being a kind of attempt to undermine US power.But I think most countries in the world accept the notion of a shared future. Personally, I think that, in this respect, we have to accept that the US and China don't understand each other. So I do think that we need to understand that a shared future is one based on cooperation. That's important. I don't think that the development of shared understanding will go quickly enough, but we have to remember that people who don't understand each other can still cooperate. There are limits to understanding, but we have to promote the advantages of cooperation.Global Times: You mentioned that ""an integrated West really is out of date...and China leadership now is best applied in the global institutions."" What did you mean by that? What role can China play?Albrow: China is very much in favor of global institutions and global governance, and it does everything it can to support them. It fits with China's own sense of history. It fits with the idea of the middle kingdom, because it builds relationships through the world as a whole. And global governance, as we know it today, is bringing people together with shared values and shared purposes, like the Millennium Development Goals. If you belong to the UN, you belong to that mission to save the world. So I think it fits very neatly with China history. The paradox is that the US is always very ambivalent about the UN. As we know, time and again, the US is interested in going its own way and forgetting about the UN. Now, in general, I think China is very concerned with global governance, and anxious to fit in with it and see it move forward.Global Times: You also pointed out that ""China offers the world qualities that can mobilize other countries to meet global threats."" What are the greatest threats facing the world today? What is the problem with the repeated failure of international governance mechanisms? Albrow: The big problem today is the fracturing of the consensus around globalization. I'm afraid to say this has been one of the consequences of globalization. Globalization advances the global economy, and it advances top economies. We know historically from our experience in the UK in the 19th century. We called it free trade. It was to the advantage of the most powerful country, not necessarily to the advantage of smaller countries and vulnerable countries. But it is to the collective advantage of the world as a whole. When you look at any individual country, you will find all kinds of damaging results from globalization. And one of the paradoxes is that the US is one of those countries which have suffered from globalization, even though it has promoted it. As a consequence, very large areas of US industry have become out of date. Many people feel resentful that they are out of work. We have the polarization of politics in the US, but we also have polarization of politics in many other countries too. This is, in the broader sense, a consequence of globalization. It's going to take a great deal of skill and wisdom on the part of world leaders to solve this problem. In this respect, China has got to take the leading role. China must take the leading role in bringing peace and harmony as far as possible in all the troubled spots of the world, and that includes Israel, Ukraine and Yemen. All the troubled spots are the areas where China diplomacy has got to be very active in trying to create peace because peace is obviously in the best interests of the world.",TWO SESSIONS 2024 ,OPINION,"The deputies to the 14th National People's Congress (NPC) of various ethnic groups take a group photo in Tiananmen Square on March 4, 2023.

19,Can bombing ease tensions in the Red Sea?,Xin Ping,2024-03-02,"The Red Sea, one of the busiest shipping routes for global trade, has been churning since the end of last year. In November 2023, in a show of support for the Palestine, the Houthis in Yemen launched attacks on ships ""linked to Israel"" passing through the Red Sea. In the following months, the US and the UK carried out large-scale airstrikes on military targets and infrastructure in Yemen, further escalating tensions in the region. The impact of tensions in the Red Sea is not limited to this region, but has been felt across the world, as the Red Sea-Suez Canal route is crucial for the international shipping of goods and energy - more than 20,000 big cargo vessels take this route annually. Harassment of civilian ships by the Houthis and violent response from the US and the UK have seriously jeopardized the security of shipping lanes and hence destabilized global production and supply chains. ING statistics show that in early January 2024, 90 percent of the container ships on this route were forced to change course, causing several weeks of delays in ocean-going supplies and a sharp rise in freight rates. Unsurprisingly, when a main shipping artery ""malfunctions,"" the global market suffers from a stroke, if not a long-time paralysis.Harassing civilian vessels on international waters is wrong. But it is also a gross violation of international law to bomb a sovereign country without authorization from the UN. The attacks by the US and the UK run counter to the spirit of ""exercising prudence and restraint"" manifested in numerous UN resolutions on international and regional conflicts. The status of the US already being a party to the conflict with the Houthis also deprives it of the excuse of ""self-defense."" But still, the US resorted to its typical way of conflict resolution - violence.Any reasonable person would know that reckless military action never helps protect the safety of commercial vessels, freedom of navigation or human rights. Military strikes that test the other side's red line never bring peace or prosperity, but only cause more civilian casualties and worsen the security dilemma. Using violence may be cruel, but it is efficient in international relations, in the eyes of cynical US politicians. Maybe from the US perspective, the world is one big jungle and ""elephants"" can reach for fruit however they see fit, even if by stamping on countless ""ants.""If you review the overseas operations of the US carefully, you will find that unilateral bombing is a habitual US reaction to the ""troubles"" it encountered. In March 1999, more than 2,000 innocent civilians were killed and nearly 1 million displaced as a result of NATO bombings in the Balkans, which were conducted without a UN mandate. Over 31,000 depleted uranium bombs were dropped, causing a surge in cancer and leukemia in the region. From 2016 to 2019, 3,833 civilians in Syria were killed directly by bombings of the US-led coalition, and half of the victims were women and children. According to the US Public Broadcasting Service, the so-called ""most accurate air strikes in history"" on the city of Raqqa alone resulted in the deaths of 1,600 Syria civilians. Ironically, all those efforts to ""prevent humanitarian crises from happening"" ended up creating humanitarian disasters. The New York Times, citing more than 1,300 classified Pentagon documents, said that a large portion of airstrikes launched by the US since 2014 had ""serious intelligence flaws,"" such as sloppy and hasty reconnaissance, unclear targets and deaths of countless innocent civilians, including children. Do we have a way out of this vicious cycle? Yes, if we discard the US way and get back on the right track.First, address the root cause of tension. Deescalate the Palestinian-Israeli Conflict by advancing the two-state solution and effectively implementing relevant UN resolutions.Second, he who tied the knot should untie it. Parties directly involved, namely Israel, Hamas and the Houthis need to exercise restraint and think rationally. Displacing the Palestine people and forcing them to migrate is morally wrong, and endless strategic blackmail will only drag the situation into an abyss.Third, major powers should play a responsible role. Countries like the US need to change their mindset and strive to shift the global agenda from ""war and peace"" to ""development and prosperity,"" rather than taking advantage of chaos out of self-interest. In fact, it is not so difficult for the US to contribute - it only needs to put aside its greed and obsession, and translate its rhetoric about protecting human rights and so on into action.The author is a commentator on international affairs, writing regularly for Xinhua News, CGTN, China Daily, Global Times, etc. He can be reached at xinping604@gmail.com.",OPINION,VIEWPOINT,Photo: CFP,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'Red Sea': ('LOC', 4), 'Palestine': ('LOC', 1), 'Yemen': ('LOC', 2), 'Israel': ('LOC', 1), 'US': ('LOC', 7), 'UK': ('LOC', 3), 'Suez Canal': ('LOC', 1), 'Houthis': ('MISC', 3), 'ING': ('ORG', 1), 'UN': ('ORG', 2)}"
20,Britain: Stop throwing stones – you live in a glass house,Mark Blacklock,2024-03-01,"There is a country where politicians want to arrest and fine you just for wearing a mask at a protest, or send you to jail for up to six months for shouting too loudly at a public demonstration. If the police think your protest event is causing ""more than minor"" disruption, they can arrest you. In fact, there is a whole raft of legislation designed to stifle dissent in this country. It disguises this incremental form of repression as well-intended measures to protect public order and safety - but it is designed to protect only itself from criticism. This is Britain.So it came as something of a surprise when British Foreign Secretary David Cameron had the nerve to launch an attack on the Article 23 legislation of the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR), which is intended to combat crimes such as espionage, sabotage, sedition and external interference. Rather disingenuously, then, Cameron ignored this and claimed instead that the law would be used to stifle freedom of expression. He claimed that British officials had raised their concerns with the government in Hong Kong, and he urged the authorities there to ""reconsider their proposals."" What pompous rot.There's an old English saying which states that people living in glass houses shouldn't throw stones. Its message is a simple truth which Cameron might do well to heed: that it is foolish to accuse others of something of which you yourself are guilty. A more forthright way of putting it might be to say ""Don't be such a hypocrite.""One would have thought that a politician with such vast experience - he led the Conservative Party for 11 years and was British prime minister for six of them before retiring from politics, and then returning in his present role - would have had more sense than to take the proposed new security law so out of context and say that the measures designed to combat crimes like terrorism and sedition would be used to stop legitimate peaceful protest.The day after Cameron spoke, US State Department spokesman Matthew Miller took his cue from the foreign secretary and also hit out at Article 23 legislation. One specific criticism, which echoed Cameron's concerns, was that legal definitions were too ""broad and vague"" and would be subject to wide interpretation. Ironically, critics had the same criticism of 2022's Police, Crime and Sentencing and Courts Act of Britain. They accused Britain of concocting ""vague and undefined police and government powers to clamp down on any protests.""Britain's war on protesters took on an added dimension this week when Prime Minister Rishi Sunak accused protesters who demonstrated outside parliament, town halls or the offices of politicians of ""mob rule,"" and - despite the convention that politicians should not interfere with police operational matters - urged the country's chief constables to get tougher with them. It is ironic that this is the same country which praised the Hong Kong rioters of 2019. Former home secretary Suella Braverman has recently described hundreds of thousands of protesters demonstrating on Britain's streets against the killing in Gaza as ""hate"" marchers. All of these things amount to an attempt to curb and criminalize the right to protest.Sunak also said this week, this time without any sense of irony, that UK protesters are trying to ""shout down free debate,"" despite his trying to do precisely that with new laws aimed at deflecting legitimate protest against politicians. It certainly seems to be the case in the UK, if recent polls are correct. It is estimated that an extraordinary 65 percent of the British population disapproves of the government, with just 16 percent approving of it. No wonder people in Britain want to protest - and no wonder politicians want to stop them.The author is a journalist and lecturer in Britain. opinion@globaltimes.com.cn",OPINION,VIEWPOINT,The view of Hong Kong Photo: VCG,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'Britain': ('LOC', 3), 'Hong Kong': ('LOC', 2), 'Region': ('LOC', 1), 'HKSAR': ('LOC', 1), 'US': ('LOC', 1), 'British': ('MISC', 3), 'Article 23': ('MISC', 2), 'Basic Law of': ('MISC', 1), 'English': ('MISC', 1), 'Act': ('MISC', 1), 'David Cameron': ('PER', 5), 'Matthew Miller': ('PER', 1), 'Special Administrative': ('ORG', 1), 'Conservative Party': ('ORG', 1), 'Department': ('ORG', 1)}"
21,China urges immediate cease-fire after attacks on Gaza aid-seekers kill 112,Zhang Han,2024-03-01,"China on Friday again urged the parties involved, Israel in particular, to bring about an immediate cease-fire and ensure the safety of civilians, after attacks on Thursday against Palestine aid-seekers killed at least 112 and injured more than 700 in Gaza.China Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning made the remarks at Friday's routine press briefing, calling on efforts to ensure humanitarian aid can be accessed. The Gaza is currently facing an unprecedented humanitarian disaster, and the UN must take immediate action to promote a cease-fire and end the fighting, Mao said in response to the US' blocking the UN from issuing a statement on the killing. The major countries involved should truly uphold a fair and responsible attitude and play a constructive role in promoting an immediate cease-fire, Mao said. China will continue to work with all parties in the international community to push the UN to take further responsible and meaningful actions, make unremitting efforts to extinguish the flames of war in Gaza and alleviate the humanitarian crisis, promote the implementation of the ""two-state solution"" and achieve long-term stability in the Middle East region, she said.Humanitarian groups - including UNICEF, Doctors Without Borders, and Mercy Corp - condemned the killing after Israel soldiers opened fire on a crowd waiting for food in northern Gaza, Al Jazeera reported Friday.Acknowledging that Israel soldiers had opened fire on the crowd, Israel government spokesperson Avi Hyman blamed ""Gazan truck drivers"" for dozens of the deaths as overwhelmed drivers rammed into the aid-seekers, causing hit-and-runs and a stampede, AFP reported. Analysts said the Thursday killing might not have started as a deliberate massacre, but the tragic development stemmed from shortages caused by the war, and it shows that the humanitarian disaster has become so grave in the Gaza that the situation has dropped to the bottom of an abyss. Despite facing mounting pressure from the international community, Israel is conducting assaults in northern Gaza and obstinately advancing its plan to raid the southern city of Rafah, Liu Zhongmin, a professor at the Middle East Studies Institute of Shanghai International Studies University, told the Global Times on Friday. That again rang alarm bells for the international community to take immediate action to alleviate the crisis, otherwise the rights of Palestine will continue to be eroded and prospects for a two-state solution will ultimately vanish into nothing, the expert stressed. The White House said it had asked its close ally Israel to probe the ""tremendously alarming"" deaths of aid-seekers in Gaza and the incident ""needs to be thoroughly investigated."" President Joe Biden said the killing of more than 100 Palestine near aid trucks will complicate talks as Washington attempts to broker a temporary cease-fire deal. The release of captives by Hamas would result in a cease-fire in Gaza over a period of at least six weeks, AFP reported, citing the White House.China observers challenged the US' adherence to such a cease-fire deal, as its prospects are becoming more dire, and even if such a deal can be made, it is too fragile to alleviate the crisis in Gaza.The US does not care about civilians in Gaza at all and is just making diplomatic gestures to appease domestic and international public opinion, Liu said. US Air Force airman Aaron Bushnell, 25, died on Monday after setting himself on fire outside the Israel Embassy in Washington in an apparent act of protest against the war in Gaza. But his death made little impression on US media. So far, 30,139 Palestine have been killed in Israel's offensive, including 13,230 children and 8,860 women. A quarter of the Gaza population, more than half a million people, are one step away from famine, according to media reports. Chen Xu, China's permanent representative to the UN Office in Geneva and other international organizations in Switzerland, on Thursday elaborated on China's position on the situation between Palestine and Israel at the 55th session of the UN Human Rights Council.China is calling on Israel to allow humanitarian organizations to have the resources they need to conduct rescue missions in Gaza and to properly enforce the interim measures and directives from the International Court of Justice, Chen said.",CHINA,DIPLOMACY,"A hospital bed is seen at the Nasser Hospital in the southern Gaza Strip city of Khan Younis, Feb. 28, 2024.

27,"Supreme court to hear Trump's immunity claim, adding farcical elements to election",Zhang Han,2024-02-29,"The US Supreme Court has agreed to hear and issue a ruling on former president Donald Trump's presidential immunity over criminal election interference charges, further prolonging the judicial procedure and increasing the possibility of an ""election before trial."" Observers said on Thursday that Donald Trump will continue the ""postponement"" strategy through any means, and the immunity ruling will add farcical elements to a presidential election that has already become a spectacle closely watched by the world. The Supreme Court said on Wednesday in a brief order that the case is on hold while the immunity claim is being considered, meaning no trial can take place, NBC reported on Wednesday.The order said the court would hear the case, which could take months to resolve, in the week of April 22. That timeline allows for a ruling by the end of the court's regular term in June, which is faster than is typical when the court hears arguments, but not as fast as prosecutors wanted it to be, according to NBC.Just hours after the court order, an Illinois judge removed Donald Trump from the state's ballot based on the 14th Amendment's so-called ""insurrectionist ban,"" CNN reported Wednesday. Illinois is now the third state where Donald Trump has been booted from the ballot, after Colorado and Maine. However, those decisions were paused pending an appeal of the Colorado case to the US Supreme Court.US media reported that even if the Supreme Court rules against Donald Trump in June, the trial may not take place until well into election season, raising questions about whether it will take place at all before Election Day in November. If Donald Trump were to win his appeal before the court, the charges would be dismissed.Li Haidong, a professor at the China Foreign Affairs University, told the Global Times on Thursday that Donald Trump will spare no efforts to drag out the Supreme Court immunity ruling and the trial. If he can be elected, there are numerous measures he could use to exempt himself from his legal troubles. Li noted that the 2024 presidential election is already full of drama, with one prospective candidate tied up in lawsuits and the other in hot water for his policy on the Gaza war. Donald Trump's promises to reimpose punitive tariffs, tighten international aid, cut taxes, and restrict immigration underline a shift toward inward-looking and unilateral policies that also worry US allies. Incumbent president Joe Biden has just won the primary in swing state Michigan, but faces a backlash from Saudi Arabia US voters, a community who voted overwhelmingly for Joe Biden in 2020, CNBC reported Tuesday. This year's already farcical presidential election has become intertwined with numerous lawsuits and now the Supreme Court ruling. This is the practice of ""separation of the three powers"" but cannot cure the current disease in US politics, Li said. No matter how the Supreme Court rules, it will add uncertainty and chaos to the election, which is a vivid example of the country's political decadence, said the expert.The presidential election is a spectacle that US care about and the whole world is eagerly watching, as who becomes the next US president will have profound implications for global politics and the stability of international relations, analysts said.",CHINA,DIPLOMACY,"Former US President Donald Trump at a New Hampshire primary election night watch party in Nashua, New Hampshire, US, on January 23, 2024 Photo: VCG",Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'US Supreme Court': ('ORG', 2), 'Supreme Court': ('ORG', 3), 'NBC': ('ORG', 2), 'CNN': ('ORG', 1), 'China Foreign Affairs University': ('ORG', 1), 'Global Times': ('ORG', 1), 'Donald Trump': ('PER', 8), 'Li Haidong': ('PER', 2), 'Joe': ('PER', 1), 'Illinois': ('LOC', 2), 'Colorado': ('LOC', 2), 'Maine': ('LOC', 1), 'US': ('LOC', 2), 'Gaza': ('LOC', 1), 'Michigan': ('LOC', 1), 'Arabia': ('LOC', 1), '14th Amendment': ('MISC', 1), 'Election Day': ('MISC', 1), 'Saudi': ('MISC', 1)}"
28,GT survey: 31 percent of global respondents believe Palestine-Israel conflict could escalate into a larger Middle East war,Shan Jie,2024-02-28,"A global survey conducted by the Global Times Institute at the end of 2023 showed that 31 percent of global respondents believed that the latest round of Palestine-Israel  conflict that broke out on October 7 was very likely to escalate into a larger Middle East war, indicating growing concern across the world over the worsening situation as well as difficulties in successfully calling for a  complete ceasefire.  According to the survey released on Thursday, among those who were aware of the Palestine-Israel conflict, 61 percent did not want to see the conflict happen. More than 60 percent of respondents in Middle Eastern countries such as Saudi Arabia and Egypt also affirmed that China mediation would help resolve the Palestine-Israel issue, according to the survey.The Palestine-Israel conflict is a humanitarian disaster no one would like to see. The survey results showed that China stands with most of the people in the world, wishing for an early and peaceful resolution to the conflict, Niu Xinchun, executive director of the China-Saudi Arabia Research Institute of Ningxia University, told the Global Times on Sunday. According to data released by the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, as of Monday, more than 30,000 people (29,514 Palestine and more than 1,200 Israel) have been killed since October 7, 2023, with nearly 70,000 being injured and 1.7 million being replaced in Gaza.  Growing concern The survey was conducted between November and December 2023, receiving nearly 17,000 responses from 20 countries across the world. Among the respondents, 89 percent indicated awareness of the event, with the exception of Saudi Arabia at 71 percent; all other 19 countries had more than 85 percent of respondents reported awareness of the conflict. Among those aware of the Palestine-Israel  conflict, 61 percent stated they did not want to see the event happen or wished it had not occurred, and 25 percent held a neutral stance. Looking at the responses by country, except for the Philippines (41 percent) and India (34 percent), more than half of the respondents in the remaining 18 countries did not wish to see the conflict happen, with Japan having the highest proportion at 82 percent, and Russia, the UK, Argentina, and China also exceeding 70 percent. Approximately 40 percent of respondents in the Philippines and India held a neutral stance.Li Haidong, a professor at the China Foreign Affairs University, told the Global Times on Sunday that if the Israel-Palestine conflict does not end quickly, its spreading effect will become increasingly obvious, primarily affecting neighboring countries and the entire Middle East. The ongoing conflict is exacerbating existing crises and contradictions, leading to further deterioration of the situation rather than the generation of a resolution.This situation could halt the reconciliation process between Israel and Saudi Arabia, accelerate the peace process between Saudi Arabia and Iran, and unite the Saudi Arabia and Islamic worlds against Israel, thereby complicating the regional dynamics further, Li noted.In the majority of West countries, including Australia, the US, the UK, France, Germany, and in three African countries, not less than 30 percent of respondents believe the conflict will expand into a larger Middle East war, with Indonesia registering the highest responses in the affirmative at 44 percent, and Turkey, Kenya, and South Africa following close behind at 40 percent, the survey showed.To alleviate the humanitarian crisis in Gaza and achieve a ceasefire as soon as possible, China has and continues to actively engage in mediation along with the UN and the international community, aiming to de-escalate regional conflicts.  It is under China's presidency, that Resolution 2712, the first resolution since this round of Palestine-Israel conflict broke out on October 7, was adopted by the UN on November 15. It was also the first UN resolution on the Palestine-Israel  issue since the end of 2016.According to the Global Times survey, more than 60 percent of respondents in Saudi Arabia and Egypt affirm that China's mediation is contributing to resolving the Israel-Palestine issue.The data shows that over half (54 percent) of respondents from Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Russia, and the US affirmed China's positive role in mediation, 23 percent thought it has little effect (including ""not very useful"" and ""completely useless""), and another 23 percent found it the question difficult to answer. According to Li, survey results indicate a majority support in both the US and other countries for China's mediation in the Palestine-Israel  conflict, reflecting China's position on the side of international justice. US respondents affirmed China's positive role at 43 percent, while 34 percent denied the effectiveness of China's efforts, according to the survey.""In the US, the close ratio of support to opposition highlights deep societal divisions, including political, social, and religious differences,"" he said, noting that this division suggests a significant split within the US, affecting its foreign policy and international image.Irresponsible US Another survey by the Global Times Research Institute at the end of 2023 in China showed that more than half of China respondents thought the US' performance in the Palestine-Israel  conflict is irresponsible. Over 40 percent (42 percent) view it as unethical, nearly 40 percent (39 percent) find it unjust, and 36 percent believe the US has hindered the resolution of the conflict.Li points out that the US shows irresponsibility in the conflict through inconsistent actions and rhetoric, offering continuous military support to Israel despite advocating for a ceasefire, and exacerbating regional conflicts, especially with relation to Iran. The US also engages in military actions in the Middle East, demonstrating a reliance on military force and contributing to regional instability. These actions highlight a disconnect between the US' stated objectives and its actual practices, leading to increased caution and resistance from the international community.The US' stance is contrary to the global consensus by partially supporting Israel and prioritizing its own political aims over humanitarianism, Niu pointed out.Such support has tarnished the US' international image and also sowed discord within the US government, experts noted.Moreover, more than 40 percent of China respondents believe the US cannot handle both the Russia-Ukraine conflict and the Palestine-Israel conflict simultaneously. In Russia, 64 percent of respondents think the US cannot handle both conflicts, a proportion that exceeds half of respondents in Japan, Indonesia, South Africa, and nearly half of all respondents in China and Argentina.Li criticizes the US strategy of engaging in multiple conflicts simultaneously as ""foolish, often leading to failure."" Li  argues that US political elites hold ""an inherent, delusional, arrogant, and prejudiced selfishness regarding America's capability to engage in conflicts,"" leading to the destructive use of resources and exacerbating conflicts. The international behavior of the US is often criticized for creating conflict and turmoil rather than fostering peace, prosperity, and stability, Li emphasized, noting that the actual actions of the US have had a negative impact in the Middle East and globally, a practice that is unpopular within the international community.Talks about a humanitarian cease-fire in the Israel-Palestine conflict made ""significant progress"" during a meeting with representatives from Israel, the US, Qatar, and Egypt in Paris on Saturday, Israel media outlet Haaretz reported, citing anonymous sources familiar with the details of the meeting.  Haaretz also cited an unnamed Israel foreign diplomat who said that ""the talks are progressing"" and as ""all parties are showing flexibility, a deal can be reached before [the holy month of] Ramadan,"" which starts on March 10.Even if a hostage deal is reached, it would only ""delay"" an assault on the crowded city of Rafah, Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was quoted as saying by Al Jazeera. Netanyahu stressed that the offensive ""will happen."" ""The Paris meeting is indeed significant progress. The progress was based on compromises and concessions from both the Hamas armed group and Israel. But it is still uncertain whether the negotiations can be concluded quickly as Hamas did not participate in the talks in Paris, so the next step is for Egypt and Qatar to report the results of the negotiations to Hamas, and then listen to Hamas' opinions,"" Niu said.Niu warned that the possibility for a total ceasefire is still slim given Israel's determination to destroy the Hamas armed group, not to mention the US' irresponsible behavior regarding the issue, by using the  Palestine-Israel  conflict as well as the Russia-Ukraine conflict as tools for its domestic partisan conflicts, by placing its own political aims above humanitarianism.",CHINA,DIPLOMACY,"Smoke billows over the southern Gaza Strip during Israeli bombardment on December 17, 2023, amid continuing battles between Israel and Hamas.

31,"Aaron Bushnell’s death points to US extreme, fundamentally ill foreign policy",Brian Berletic,2024-02-28,"US Airman Aaron Bushnell died after an extreme form of protest in which he lit himself on fire in front of the Israel embassy in Washington D.C. As Aaron Bushnell walked to the Israel embassy, he declared on film that no matter how extreme his next course of action might seem, it was incomparable to what the Palestine in Gaza were suffering. He was referring to the US government's role in arming and aiding Israel both militarily and politically in the Israel government's military operations in Gaza. This was the world Aaron Bushnell woke up into while serving in the US military. He awoke to immense injustice, the injustice he was unable to ignore. In the wake of his extreme protest, in which he doused himself with flammable fluid, lit himself on fire, and to his last breath shouted ""free Palestine,"" the West media and commentators across the West world have attempted to dismiss Aaron Bushnell's protest as ""mental illness."" Such people fall into two categories. The first category consists of those who can see and know what the US and its allies are doing around the globe is wrong, but choose to remain silent. They justify their silence by labeling individuals who are brave to speak up as ""mentally ill"" to avoid confronting their own moral cowardice.The second category includes individuals who actively support US foreign policy, regardless of its deadly and destructive nature. For both categories, Aaron Bushnell's actions challenged both categories to confront the extreme violence perpetuated by the US government and West media, disrupting the normalized portrayal of US foreign policy. The world was forced to see how ugly and disturbing violence really is.Aaron Bushnell's death has undoubtedly made an impact, whether or not people want to admit it and whether it is convenient for US foreign policy or not. Unfortunately, for many US service members, and many others across West society, when they awaken to what is really happening around them, and around the globe in their name, they feel angry and a sense of immense injustice being done, but also tremendous isolation, helplessness, and frustration. They may even feel guilt and a need to reconcile their role in perpetuating US foreign policy until awakening. It is important to carry on Aaron Bushnell's work of raising awareness of the injustice he was speaking out against. It is also important for us all to begin discussing ways we can address the many problems US foreign policy represents, rather than simply listing them off. We must find ways for those who are discontent with US policy to channel their energy, courage, and commitment in life to make this world a better place, rather than leaving them to resort to acts of desperation against what seems like immovable injustice. Aaron Bushnell's form of protest was extreme, but it was in response to a foreign policy even more extreme and one that is itself fundamentally ill. While it is too late to save him, it may not be too late to create avenues and outlets for people like him to fight for justice in life, rather than forfeit their lives to shake the US and US from their foreign policy of death. The author is a geopolitical analyst and a veteran of US Marine Corps. opinion@globaltimes.com.cn",OPINION,VIEWPOINT,"People are seen among the rubble after an Israeli airstrike in the southern Gaza Strip city of Rafah, on February 27, 2024.

32,55% of Chinese respondents say US irresponsible in handling of Palestinian-Israeli conflict: GT survey,Yang Sheng,2024-02-28,"A recently published survey conducted by the Global Times Institute at the end of 2023 showed that about 55 percent of China respondents believed the US was being ""irresponsible"" in handling the ongoing Palestinian-Israeli Conflict in Gaza, which has already killed about 30,000 people. About 42 percent of global respondents said the US is unable to properly handle the Gaza and Ukraine crises at the same time. The survey, conducted between November and December of 2023, received nearly 17,000 responses from adults of 20 countries across the world including China, US, Russia, France, UK, Germany, Japan, India, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Egypt, Kenya and Brazil.China analysts said that the results of the survey showed that China people shared the same feeling as people around the world, as the US is now facing increasing criticism, protests and pressure domestically and internationally due to its poor handling of the Gaza crisis, failing to stop the humanitarian crisis and instead vetoing resolutions for a cease-fire time and again at the UN.Aaron Bushnell, 25, a US Air Force airman who set himself on fire outside the Israel Embassy in Washington in an apparent act of protest against the war in Gaza, has died, the military and local police said on Monday. This is the latest proof that the US approach to the ongoing crisis is extremely problematic and is becoming increasingly unpopular among its own people, said experts. According to data released by the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, as of Wednesday, more than 30,000 people (29,782 Palestine and more than 1,200 Israel) have been killed since October 7, 2023, with more than 70,000 injured and 1.7 million displaced in Gaza. The Palestinian-Israeli Conflict is a humanitarian disaster that no one wants to see.

Meanwhile, 42 percent of them view the role played by the US as ""unethical,"" 39 percent find it ""unjust"" and 36 percent believe the US ""has hindered the resolution of the conflict.""Li said that the US' irresponsibility in the conflict includes inconsistent actions and rhetoric, offering continuous military support to Israel despite advocating for a cease-fire, and exacerbating regional conflicts, especially with relation to Iran. The US also engages in military actions in the Middle East, demonstrating a reliance on military force, which also adds to the regional instability. These actions highlight the disconnection between the US' stated objectives and its actual practices.By one-sidedly supporting Israel and prioritizing its own political aims over humanitarianism, the US' stance is going against the global consensus, Niu pointed out.This kind of support that allows Israel forces to kill tens of thousands of Palestine civilians has tarnished the US' international image and also sown discord within the US government, experts noted.Moreover, about 48 percent of China respondents believe the US cannot handle both the Russia-Ukraine and Palestinian-Israeli Conflict conflicts simultaneously. In Russia, 64 percent of respondents think the US cannot handle the two crises at the same time. According to the survey, on average, about 42 percent of the global respondents don't believe that Washington is able to handle the two crises properly.Li criticizes the US strategy of engaging in multiple conflicts simultaneously as ""foolish, often leading to failure.""

36,War in Gaza looms at UNHRC session,Zhang Han,2024-02-27,"UN Secretary-General António Guterres, when addressing the 55th session of the UN Human Rights Council on Monday, warned that an all-out Israel offensive on Rafah would spell the end for UN-led humanitarian relief to the people of Gaza, according to a report on the UN official website on Monday.Though the council meeting touched on a wide range of topics, the war in Gaza was the focal topic. Observers said on Tuesday that the UN session is issuing a crucial call at a critical moment, since unilateral moves and bloc confrontation mind-set of the US has jeopardized the authority and functioning of the UN bodies when Israel's assault had claimed nearly 30,000 Palestine lives and displaced 2 million. Any further extension of Israel's ground operation in the south of Gaza ""would not only be terrifying for more than a million Palestine civilians sheltering there; it would put the final nail in the coffin of our aid programs,"" Guterres said. Guterres also reiterated his longstanding concerns about the UN (UN), which he said was ""often deadlocked, unable to act on the most significant peace and security issues of our time."" China Foreign Minister Wang Yi, also a member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, said during the UNHRC session that multilateral human rights bodies should serve as platforms for constructive engagement and cooperation for all sides, rather than a battleground for group politics or bloc confrontation, Xinhua reported on Monday.Noting that the ongoing Palestinian-Israeli Conflict has cost the lives of nearly 30,000 civilians, and left close to 2 million people displaced, Wang said it falls upon the entire international community to protect the human rights of all ethnic groups and all people in a fair, equal and effective way. The US again vetoed a UN resolution demanding an immediate cease-fire in Gaza, after circulating its own deal linking a temporary cease-fire to the release of Israel captives. The third veto on February 20 has left itself in isolation from the international community. Zhu Yongbiao, director of the Center for Afghanistan Studies at Lanzhou University, told the Global Times on Tuesday that the US has been standing with Israel. No matter how the situation develops and how the humanitarian crisis further aggravates, the US did not change its stance even it means standing in opposite to most countries now.That has threatened the unity of the UN and hindered the council from taking meaningful actions, Zhu said. The US' unilateral move also demonstrated that its repeated citation of ""human rights"" to comment on and interfere in other countries' affairs is weaponizing the concept and hypocritical, Zhu said. Divisions not only emerge at the UN, but also domestically in the US. An active US Air Force serviceman set himself on fire on Sunday in front of the Israel embassy in Washington DC to protest against the Gaza war, Reuters reported on Monday. Footage circulating online shows the man shouting ""I will no longer be complicit in genocide.""US media are quite silent on the incident as ""it would further bring shame on US image and prompt doubts on its foreign policy in Mideast,"" Zhu said, as he pointed out US double standards on ""freedom of press.""On the Palestinian-Israeli Conflict, US has been adhering to bloc interests regardless of basic justice, boasting for lofty concepts while acting the opposite, analysts said.Liu Zhongmin, a professor at the Middle East Studies Institute of Shanghai International Studies University, told the Global Times on Tuesday that the US, although having mediated a temporary cease-fire deal, is playing a more destructive rather than constructive role in the big picture of Palestinian-Israeli Conflict.  US mediation is just a diplomatic gesture to appease international and domestic criticism on its current policy when Joe Biden administration wants to focus resources on the upcoming presidential election, Liu said.As for Israel, there is no sign of abandoning its original goal of ""total victory"" against Hamas despite mounting pressure from international community and even the US, Liu said.When the US hints on key progress made on negotiation for a temporary cease-fire deal, Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told media the ground offensive on Rafah will happen with or without such a deal. ""If we have a [cease-fire] deal, it will be delayed somewhat, but it will happen.""",CHINA,DIPLOMACY,"People wait to leave for Egypt via the Rafah crossing in the southern Gaza Strip, Feb. 25, 2024.(Photo: Xinhua)",Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'UN': ('ORG', 9), 'UN Human Rights Council': ('ORG', 10), 'Political Bureau': ('ORG', 1), 'CPC Central Committee': ('ORG', 1), 'UNHRC': ('ORG', 1), 'Xinhua': ('ORG', 1), 'Center': ('ORG', 1), 'António Guterres': ('PER', 3), 'Wang Yi': ('PER', 2), 'Zhu': ('PER', 1), 'Israel': ('LOC', 5), 'Rafah': ('LOC', 1), 'Gaza': ('LOC', 4), 'US': ('LOC', 4), 'Palestine': ('LOC', 2), 'China': ('LOC', 1), 'Afghanistan': ('LOC', 1), 'Palestinian - Israeli Conflict': ('MISC', 1)}"
37,"US Empire of Chaos decouples from reality, morality",S.L. Kanthan,2024-02-27,"The United States of America has mastered the art of reverse Sun Tzu. The US doesn't subdue the enemy without fighting. Instead, it engages in perpetual wars, without understanding its opponent or even itself. From Ukraine to the Middle East, the US is callously setting pivotal regions on fire, while contemplating a calamitous war in Asia. Even while the US-EU-NATO proxy war against Russia is faltering spectacularly, the US and its allies have brazenly started another war in the Middle East. With its connivance of a relentless and cruel war on Gaza, the US has become an accomplice to a humanitarian disaster, raised the odds of a region-wide war with terrifying implications for the world's economy, weakened the Middle East's long-term security and destroyed US' influence, regionally and globally.Let's start with the harrowing situation in Gaza, where Israel has dropped 65,000 tons of mostly US bombs and missiles since October 7, 2023. The death toll is horrifying: 67 percent of the more than 14,000 people killed in Gaza are estimated to be women and children. The physical injuries and psychological trauma are so horrendous that the head of Doctors Without Borders testified, ""Children as young as 5 tell us that they prefer to die.""Gaza, a tiny strip of 11 kilometers x 40 kilometers, is not only the world's most densely populated region; it has also been described as a ""concentration camp"" and an ""open-air prison."" Already 1.5 million Gazans, including 600,000 children, have been turned into refugees and are now living in tents in the southern half of Gaza, facing the possibility of permanent ethnic cleansing - Nakba 2.0.The US could have easily prevented this disaster. Instead, it is aiding and abetting Israel. Three times since the conflict started, the US has vetoed cease-fire resolutions at the UN. Moreover, the US is not even supporting the delivery of water, food, medicine, fuel and electricity to Gaza. The US has also cut off funding to UN, the most critical organization aiding Gaza. The cynicism and barbarity of the so-called West civilization are obscene.US politicians and media endlessly cry about human rights only when it suits their political agenda - such as their lies about the Uygurs to destabilize China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region.As China, Russia and many others have pointed out, the only viable and enduring solution is Palestine statehood with a two-state solution based on the 1967 border. Interestingly, that is also the official position of the US and EU, who are playing a deceptive game with Palestine lives. Looking at the big picture, one would find that the US empire's actions are puzzling and self-defeating. The ramifications for the global economy would be devastating, especially if and when the war involves Iran. Sadly, nothing is off limits for the declining but delusional US empire. The Pentagon and US think tanks have been consistently fantasizing about everlasting unipolar hegemony. One example of their hubris: US General Wesley Clark revealed that, immediately after the 9/11, the Bush administration had planned to take out seven Middle East countries in five years.However, even after two decades of disastrous military adventures in that region, US elites have learned nothing. Consider how the US and the UK are bombing Yemen's Houthi rebels who have been attacking - and sometimes capturing or sinking - Israel and West ships in the Red Sea as a retaliation for the destruction of Gaza. The Houthis, who seem astonishingly immune to US attacks, are shooting down $30 million US drones, and have become the first in the world to use anti-ship ballistic missiles.Another daunting group in the region is the Hezbollah, the world's most heavily armed non-state actor. With its formidable arsenal of ballistic, anti-tank, anti-air and anti-ship missiles, the Hezbollah can pull Israel and the US into a decade-long war of attrition.Meanwhile, US military bases in Iraq and Syria have been under constant attacks from a myriad of resistance groups. Plus, the Iraqi parliament has reiterated its decades-old demand: Go home Yankees. Back in the US, Kellogg's is promoting cereals for dinner, because poverty is skyrocketing. Homelessness and suicide rates are at record levels, and the country is so polarized. However, oblivious to all these domestic crises, the US military-industrial-media-complex is driving the nation into an abyss, while endangering the rest of the world.Contemporary Middle Eastern leaders of Saudi Arabia, UAE, Qatar, Iran and others in the region are visionary. For example, Saudi Arabia children are learning the China language, and Prince Mohammed bin Salman is building futuristic cities. These leaders are working with China and BRICS to focus on trade, development and cooperation. A post-Pax Americana world is emerging, and it will be free from the anti-Sun Tzu dogma of the Empire of Chaos. The author is a geopolitical analyst, columnist, blogger, podcaster, and writer based out of Bangalore, India.

38,EU needs to acknowledge the end of Global South compliance with Europe-centered world order,Ma Yuhan,2024-02-27,"Josep Borrell, the EU Union's high representative for foreign affairs, recently acknowledged that the ""era of West dominance has indeed definitively ended."" He wrote this in a blog post on the official website of the EU's diplomatic service on February 25. As the Russia-Ukraine conflict enters its third year, Borrell's statement at this time essentially acknowledges the failure of the West strategic goal to maintain its dominant and hegemonic position in the international order through the conflict. Since the onset of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, the West had hoped to leverage it to strengthen internal cohesion and make Global South countries adhere to its strategic calls. However, as the Global South maintains its independent stance in the Russia-Ukraine conflict, and as the conflict increasingly binds EU, this original goal has not been achieved.In particular, the Israel-Palestine conflict has dealt a severe blow to this goal, revealing the clear double standards of the West and causing dissatisfaction among many Global South countries. At the Third EU Indo-Pacific Ministerial Forum held on February 2, senior officials from Global South countries attending the meeting criticized the West for its ""double standards,"" adopting drastically different policies toward the Russia-Ukraine and Israel-Palestine conflicts, and failing to consistently emphasize respect for international law. Many foreign media outlets described this forum, which left the EU embarrassed, as ""EU grilled"" and ""EU's courtship of Indo-Pacific gets cold shoulder."" This significantly undermined the West narrative on the Russia-Ukraine conflict and highlighted the political independence of Global South countries, Sun Keqin, a research fellow at the China Institutes of Contemporary International Relations, told the Global Times.In recent years, West countries have shown a notable increase in attention toward the Global South. Sun believes that one important reason for this is that West nations recognize that the outcome of the power struggle between the West and countries it deems ""enemies,"" such as China and Russia, largely lies in the political stance of the Global South. Therefore, they are consciously seeking to influence and court Global South countries. This also indicates that the West has not departed from its traditional mentality of camp confrontation. EU's true objective is to uphold West dominance by wooing Global South nations, ensuring that they do not pose a threat to the West strategically while politically aligning with West interests to aid in the confrontation and competition against China and Russia. However, this objective has evidently failed.The end of the era of West dominance is a fact, yet EU still adheres to its Eurocentrism, full of ""arrogance and prejudice."" Borrell said that the Russia-Ukraine and Israel-Palestine conflicts have ""increased tremendously the political space"" of the Global South vis-a-vis the EU, and accused Russia of ""really taking good advantages"" of their mistakes to blame ""double standards."" EU has not yet realized that the so-called situation of ""the rest against the West"" that it needs to avoid does not stem from Russia's ""battle of narrative,"" but rather from the fact that the days when the Global South was forced to comply with the EU-centered world order are gone. The Global South seeks peace and equality, while EU brings conflict and control. The Global South seeks win-win cooperation and economic development, while EU brings zero-sum competition and division. This is fundamentally different from the interests of developing countries. On one hand, the West insists on the so-called ""rules-based international order,"" which is actually rules made according to its own interests and political correctness. From the perspective of the Global South, such an order aimed at maintaining West dominance is undoubtedly hypocritical. On the other hand, under the Russia-Ukraine conflict, apart from the US profiting from arms sales, the entire EU economy has been sluggish, a fact that is evident to the entire world, including the Global South. The Global South certainly does not want to sacrifice its own development to align with the West.Two years have passed, and EU is still locked up in the Ukraine crisis. EU is declining but still arrogant. Instead of reflecting on its own shortcomings and timely extricating itself from the quagmire, EU repeatedly attributes its decline and the estrangement from the Global South to external factors. For the EU, returning to the path of peace and development is the solution to its estrangement with Global South countries. The author is a reporter with the Global Times. opinion@globaltimes.com.cn",OPINION,VIEWPOINT,Illustration: Xia Qing/GT,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'Josep Borrell': ('PER', 2), 'Sun Keqin': ('PER', 2), 'EU Union': ('ORG', 8), 'China Institutes of Contemporary International Relations': ('ORG', 1), 'Global Times': ('ORG', 1), 'West': ('MISC', 14), 'South': ('MISC', 2), 'Third': ('MISC', 1), 'Indo - Pacific Ministerial Forum': ('MISC', 1), 'Russia': ('LOC', 7), 'Ukraine': ('LOC', 5), 'Global South': ('LOC', 9), 'Israel': ('LOC', 2), 'Palestine': ('LOC', 2), 'Indo': ('LOC', 1), 'Pacific': ('LOC', 1), 'China': ('LOC', 2)}"

40,Russia-Ukraine conflict further subordinates Europe to the US,Global Times,2024-02-26,"Editor's Note: February 24 marks the anniversary of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, which has been ongoing for two years with no end in sight. Why can't the conflict be resolved? As it continues, has the West's mentality of ""defeating Russia"" evolved? How does the conflict impact global geopolitical patterns? On the two-year anniversary, the Global Times (Global Times) collected views within the US and EU.  In the fifth interview of the series, Ben Norton (Norton), founder and editor of Geopolitical Economy Report, an independent news outlet, shared his views. He emphasized that the control of the US and the West is the root cause of the inability to stop the Russia-Ukraine conflict.Global Times: The Russia-Ukraine conflict has been ongoing for two years. Why is there still no end in sight?Norton: The problem is that the West governments in NATO do not want the conflict to end. And the US has made it clear that its goal is to weaken Russia. The US Defense Secretary, Lloyd Austin, said he ""wants to see Russia weakened."" And we've seen that there have been repeated attempts at negotiating a cease-fire going back to the very beginning of this conflict. There is so much evidence showing that Russia wanted this war to end early on.In fact, Russia did not even want this war. If we go back to look at what happened in late 2021, the Russia government repeatedly asked for written security guarantees from NATO and the EU Union. They all refused to give Russia written security guarantees. And they refused to say that Ukraine would not join NATO. From Russia's perspective, Ukraine joining NATO is an existential security problem.Everything that happened in Ukraine was completely predictable. The US knew the risks of expanding NATO up to Russia's borders. It continued pushing and pushing, causing this war. At the end of the day, what this shows is that it's the US that is fundamentally responsible for this conflict. The US sponsored the 2014 coup that overthrew Ukraine's democratically elected government. The US has opposed all efforts to bring about peace. This has also significantly hurt EU, not just Ukraine. EU is suffering the consequences. The US is one of the only countries that is benefiting.Global Times: Do you think the US and EU are tired of the Russia-Ukraine conflict? Norton: We can't speak about the US and EU as a unified bloc. Although they are allies, there are a lot of differences. A few countries want this conflict to end. However, other countries, for example Poland, which is very hawkish, want the war to continue. There are still very significant differences inside NATO, and many West governments are not in agreement about what to do in Ukraine. However, this war has further subordinated EU to the US, and it has strengthened the US hegemony in EU. EU think tanks are saying that EU countries are becoming vassals of the US, like going back to the medieval era of feudal relations, and EU is losing its sovereignty.The US is gaining more political, military and economic control because EU is relying on the US for its security, although, supposedly, in many ways, the US is actually hurting EU security. But in terms of military relations in NATO, the US is the leader and EU relies on the US.Global Times: How long can military aid from the US and EU to Ukraine continue?Norton: It's impossible to predict exactly how long, but I do not think that military aid will continue for much longer because there are already a lot of protests going on in the US and EU. Many people oppose sending more and more weapons and military assistance to Ukraine. And many people are saying that there should be a peaceful resolution and diplomatic negotiations to end this conflict after West powers have already sent tens of billions of dollars in weapons.When US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen was asked if the US could fund the Russia-Ukraine conflict and the Israel-Palestine conflict at the same time, she said ""Absolutely."" However, there may be limitations in the West industries that produce military technology, which could impact the ability to fully support both conflicts at the same time. In recent decades, in particular, in the neoliberal era with the rise of neoliberal economics, the US and West countries' industrial sectors have weakened.In the US, there are reports that the US may not produce all of the military equipment, ammunition, shells and other materials that are to be sent to both Ukraine and Israel. Global Times: What impact has the Russia-Ukraine conflict had on the image of the US?Norton: The US always tries to portray itself as the leader of the world with this very arrogant hegemonic mentality.Many people in the Global South, which represents the global majority, can now see that the US is not trying to bring about peace. It's not trying to encourage negotiations for peace talks. This isn't a surprise for many people, because we know that the US has been at war for basically all of its history. It comes as no surprise to see that the US is a war-mongering power that wages war around the world.The US is willing to sacrifice its allies in order to advance its geopolitical interests. And there's a phrase that has become popular: The US and NATO are willing to fight to the last Ukraine because it's not the US soldiers who are dying. It's not NATO that has soldiers who are dying. It's Ukrainians who are dying. And the US is benefiting. Although the US is seen as more of a EU ally, it's also seen as dominating EU. And a lot of people in EU are not happy about that. However, at the same time, internationally, more and more people can see that the US is a force for instability. Instead of promoting peace and stability, it is promoting more conflict and war.Global Times: What is your opinion on the continuous hype of the ""Russia threat"" by US media and politicians? Norton: We should keep in mind that in the US, the war in Ukraine is not very popular with a lot of people. The majority of people in the US want peace talks to end the conflict. This is also becoming a political issue.However, unfortunately, the reality is that in the US political system, there is no option for peace. And the reality is that the US is not really a democracy. The US is very undemocratic, and the political system is very corrupt, and it's controlled by money. In the US, there are two options, which are both pro-war parties, the Republican and the Democrats. They both support war and neither one is for peace.Most US simply want to have better economic livelihoods and a lot of people in the US are frustrated because the US government does not spend money on social services to help people.Meanwhile, there is growing poverty, and there is growing homelessness. The US government has abandoned them and has failed to address these issues. The US government is only fixated on maintaining a global empire and waging war around the world. This is true of both political parties. So I think a lot of people in the US are very frustrated with the political system. That's why, in every single presidential election, roughly half of the population does not vote in the election or in the midterm elections.

Ben Norton. Photo: Courtesy of NortonGT: Do you foresee a cease-fire happening in 2024? What factors will affect the conflict this year？Norton: It's very difficult to predict what will happen because the reality is that many people—the majority of people in Ukraine—want diplomatic negotiations to end the conflict.Now, the situation in Ukraine is becoming desperate because the Ukraine military is running out of ammunition. It's running out of weapons, and it's running out of soldiers. We've seen that the Ukraine military is now trying to pressure Ukraine refugees living abroad in other countries to come back to Ukraine in order to fight in the war. So the Ukraine military is simply running out of the resources that it needs. At some point, Ukraine will have to come to a political agreement. That's why the US policy is so destructive, and it's the Ukraine people who are suffering.Global Times: China Foreign Minister Wang Yi reiterated China's position on the Russia-Ukraine conflict at the Munich Security Conference. What role can China play in promoting peace?Norton: I think China is a very important player on the international stage, pushing for peace. China can play a very important role, and China has already played a very important role in encouraging peace, not only in Ukraine but around the world. We've seen that China has become an important diplomatic leader, encouraging peace, for instance, in West Asia between Saudi Arabia and Iran. Now, I think that China could potentially help broker negotiations. However, the problem is that the US is exercising hegemonic control over Ukraine, and the US does not want Ukraine to negotiate, especially with China overseeing the negotiations.The problem is that when the US and NATO are willing to encourage peace and diplomacy, the war in Ukraine will end, and China could play an important role in that. But until the US stops this hegemonic mentality and this imperialist politics of trying to maintain an empire in an imperialist system, I don't think anyone can truly bring about peace.",OPINION,VIEWPOINT,"Demonstrators gather during an anti-conflict rally at the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, DC, on February 19, 2023.

41,"US signals progress on Gaza cease-fire deal, but influence on Mideast conflict doubted",Zhang Han,2024-02-26,"Although the US signals that progress has been made on a cease-fire deal in the Gaza, Israel strikes continue and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reaffirmed Israel's goal of ""total victory"" against Hamas, hinting at a ground offensive on Rafah with or without a deal. Whether or not a cease-fire deal can be reached in the near future, China observers on Monday doubted a deal can influence the big picture of the Palestinian-Israeli Conflict when the situation is developing toward Israel's hopes at the cost of Palestine' lives. US National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan told CNN on Sunday local time that negotiators for the US, Egypt, Qatar and Israel ""came to an understanding"" on the basic contours of a hostage deal during talks in Paris, Reuters reported. The deal is still under negotiation, said Sullivan, who added there will have to be indirect discussions by Qatar and Egypt with Hamas.However, Netanyahu told CBS it was not clear yet whether a hostage deal would materialize from the talks. ""If we have a (cease-fire) deal, it will be delayed somewhat, but it will happen.""A Gaza deal also won't affect Israel's Hezbollah fight, France24 quoted Israel Defense Minister Yoav Gallant as saying. Liu Zhongmin, a professor at the Middle East Studies Institute of Shanghai International Studies University, told the Global Times that the temporary cease-fire deal under discussion and the Palestinian-Israeli Conflict are actually two different matters. The deal will be similar to the one in November, but that cannot bring peace to the Middle East, analysts said. Given Israel's attitude on a cease-fire deal, the continuous strikes and a recent ""post-war Gaza plan,"" the war will continue in the direction of Israel's hopes, Liu said.Liu worried that even though the war, which has claimed nearly 30,000 Palestine lives, will ultimately end, the bilateral balance will never return to the situation before October 7, 2023. Israel has a systematic plan to attack Gaza and enhance its control over the Strip and even the West Bank, where Palestine used to reside, and that would severely erode the right of self-determination of the Palestine people, Liu said. According to the plan released on Thursday, Israel would maintain security and military control over all land West of Jordan, including the occupied West Bank and Gaza - territories where the Palestine want to create their independent state, Al Jazeera reported Friday.Palestine Prime Minister Mohammad Shtayyeh resigned on Monday as US pressure grows on President Abbas to shake up the Palestine Authority and begin work on a political structure that can govern a Palestine state following the war, Al Jazeera reported on Monday. Considering the prospects of the war, the ongoing cease-fire deal negotiation, for Israel and the US, is nothing more than a diplomatic approach to addressing mounting domestic and international pressure, Liu said.  If the US does want a meaningful cease-fire and cares about civilians in Gaza, it would not have vetoed three rounds of UN resolutions calling for an immediate cease-fire, Liu said, adding that the US' support for a two-state solution is ""lip deep.""  After the latest veto, US isolation became more apparent at the Group of 20 meeting, where countries including Brazil, South Africa and the US' close ally Australia criticized the war in Gaza with stern remarks in contrast to the US' indulgent actions.  China Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said at Monday's routine press briefing that the escalation of the latest Palestinian-Israeli Conflict has resulted in the devastating humanitarian situation in Gaza. Nearly 30,000 civilians were killed and about 1.9 million people were displaced.An immediate cease-fire is the prevailing call and overwhelming consensus of the international community. The US should lend an ear and take concrete actions to play a constructive role for the cease-fire and deescalation of the humanitarian crisis, Mao said.",CHINA,DIPLOMACY,"A child rides a bike at Maghazi refugee camp in central Gaza Strip, Feb. 23, 2024.

43,"Two years after Russia-Ukraine conflict, Western hypocrisy is harder and harder to sell",Global Times,2024-02-25,"Editor's Note: February 24 marks the anniversary of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, which has been ongoing for two years with no end in sight. Why can't the conflict be resolved? As it continues, has the West's mentality of ""defeating Russia"" evolved? How does the conflict impact global geopolitical patterns? The Global Times (Global Times) collected views within the US and EU. In the fourth interview of the series, Chay Bowes (Bowes), an Irish journalist, writer and analyst, who addressed the conflict at a UN meeting on June 2023, shared his insights. Global Times: The Russia-Ukraine conflict is entering its third year. What do you think is the biggest obstacle to ending the conflict?           Bowes: I have been living here in Russia and working among Russians. The view from this side is certainly that the biggest obstacle to ending the conflict is the West. There is an appetite for peace in Ukraine among ordinary Ukraine and Russia people, and in the Russia government. The view in Russia is that the main obstacle is Ukraine's West backers, who are providing weapons, cash and political support for the prolongation, and in some ways, the expansion of this conflict. From my own personal view, regardless of how you believe this conflict started - in the Maidan protest in the beginning in 2014, there was CIA or US support - the main reason this war is able to continue is due to West aid, money and weapons. President Vladimir Putin made it quite clear in his interview with Tucker Carlson, if they want the war to stop, they can easily end it. Global Times: How do you suggest the Russia-Ukraine conflict could be resolved?Bowes: The conflict must be resolved and will be resolved - all conflicts end in some kind of accommodation. This is a fact of history. But at this stage, the frustrations the Russians feel here, as President Vladimir Putin said in his interview with Carlson, Russia did advocate for a peace deal very early on in the conflict, which was, according to Russia, and according to facts and data, stopped by the British prime minister in conjunction with the White House that the Ukrainians should fight on, that they shouldn't come to an accommodation with the Russians. That frustration has made the Russians consider that they can't really trust any West-brokered peace deal, and that this peace will have to be agreed on the basis of the realpolitik, the real situation on the ground.The real situation on the ground is that the Russia economy is strong. We hear that the West-backed attempt at this economic war against Russia has failed. It's damaging the West world far more than it has done to Russia. Ordinary Russia people on the streets are now resigned to the fact that this war may continue until Russia achieves its goals. It seems that the old pathways of diplomacy that existed during the Cold War between Russia and America, between the security services and diplomats, these bridges have collapsed into the water. The longer the war goes on, it seems to me, the more territory Russia gains, the stronger the Russia economy becomes. President Vladimir Putin is very popular here among Russians, despite what the West media might tell you. More fatigue will creep in among the West backers of Ukraine. Ukraine has no way to fight this war. It has no economy to fund the conflict. It has diminishing manpower. It's desperate to recruit more men into the military. This is a proxy war with the West desperately trying to prop up what remains of Ukraine's resistance. And what has happened recently doesn't bode well. Global Times: Have the Israel-Palestine conflict and the Red Sea crisis diverted US' attention from the Ukraine battlefield?Bowes: It absolutely has. It has shone a light on West hypocrisy. Take the allegations made against Russia about its conduct in Ukraine - targeting the civilians. When we see what's happened in Palestine with literally thousands and thousands of children, men, women, innocent civilians being killed in a very short space of time, this shone a light on West hypocrisy - the reticence among West powers to condemn Israel, their ally. The US is the foremost ally of Israel. Since Israel's founding in 1948, the US has given hundreds of millions of dollars, mostly in military aid to prop up its very militaristic behavior against Palestine. Prior to October, last year, people were becoming war weary when Ukraine wasn't achieving on the battlefield. The various weapons, the leopard tanks, the challenger tanks and everything that was meant to turn the conflict around, all these game changers, the counter offenses, which were going to seize territory, had absolutely failed. Many Ukrainians are dying and people are becoming weary. 

Chay Bowes. Photo: Courtesy of BowesGT: How will the US presidential election this year affect the trajectory of the conflict? Bowes: If there wasn't a presidential election this year, we may have already had peace.Take the Vietnam War. It was artificially prolonged by the US in order to go through their electoral cycles. No US president, presidential nominee or presidential candidate wants to withdraw from a war or lose a war during the election cycle. Donald Trump declared that he would solve the crisis within 24 hours if reelected. Everybody in the US accepts that without US money, US fuel, US political input and intelligence, this conflict could not have lasted this long. Joe Biden is now suggesting that anybody who is against prolonging the war, by continually funding more and more billions of dollars into Ukraine, which doesn't really be having an impact and seems to be losing militarily, economically and politically, is sort of complicit in the empire of Russia. This war in Ukraine is being prolonged by the Joe Biden administration, in order to not deliver a catastrophic failure. It is certainly not going to end until the outcome of the US elections is known. Global Times: How does the Russia-Ukraine conflict affect the image of the US?Bowes: It has done so in a very negative way. I think much of what the US has been doing since the end of World War II, is now essentially obvious to everybody watching this show. Since the end of World War II, the US has been responsible for the deaths of tens of millions of human beings. It's not Russia, it's not China or Iran, or any country the West says is the enemy. They haven't invaded other countries or overturned other governments. The CIA was aggressive and moved to destabilize Ukraine in the post war period in the 1950s. There had been several operations to try and peel away the Ukraine soviet socialism from the Soviet Union. The US has been at war for over 90 percent of its existence. It sells more weapons and spends more money on war than the next 10 countries combined. China is portraying the idea that the age of divide and conquer is over and this is the age of unite and prosper. It's also doing that with countries like Russia, and saying this isn't an exclusive globe, we just want to build a better world on the basis of cooperation, rather than domination. The US, on the other hand, has a lot of social problems in its own country. Nearly 40 million US live in poverty. It can send hundreds of billions of dollars to other countries to carry out wars against these perceived enemies while its education system and medical system are collapsing. How did this happen if the US is the leader of freedom? And who are the winners and losers here in this perpetual war? The title of the Munich Security Report this year is ""Lose-Lose?"" It suggested that more and more countries are peeling away from this global hegemony and US-dominated world. They're looking to a world where they can trade in their own currency, where they can protect, define and celebrate their own culture, language, heritage and religion within the protection of a much more pluralistic, multilateral and multipolar world. This is why BRICS is so powerfully burgeoning and growing and offering so much hope to countries in Africa and in Southeast Asia for a more pluralistic, fairer way to do business. So, of course, it has impacted the US image. The US has leveraged everything it has to try and inflict its strategic defeat on Russia, but it has failed. The Russia military has shown itself to be strong and capable, and the Russia military industrial complex is growing. While NATO and the US seem to be bickering among themselves, many people in EU now don't see the EU as a light of freedom. They see it as a light of oppression. There's a lot of media oppression now in EU, as well as a lot of laws in countries like Ireland where I'm from, that make it impossible to argue against a certain way of thinking. But in this age of global media where we can talk, I can talk to you from Moscow, and the voices of reason and the voices of dissent are very difficult to suppress. One can't keep selling the same magic potion or medicine, and then keep failing. People will eventually ask: What did we get from this? How does it work? It will be much harder to sell the idea that in order to be free, you have to be like us, think like us, use our currency, abide by our religion of freedom, regardless of 40 million people living in poverty, people living in the streets, a huge drug crisis, a failing society. That pseudo-religious belief in this global US freedom, this neoliberal hegemony, is essentially running out of air. Yet for West institutes, whatever Russia does, is much like whatever China does, whatever it does will be wrong. The US can dominate its neighbors economically and military. This hypocrisy is becoming more and more evident and obvious. And that hypocrisy in regards to the Ukraine conflict is now obvious when you look at Palestine. Throughout the Ukraine conflict, Russia has not targeted civilians. People have died, regrettably. That's a tragedy. But there is certainly no policy of attacking civilians by the Russia military. West hypocrisy is harder and harder to sell in an age of global Information. I think that's critical. 2024 will be a really pivotal year for BRICS, for the Global South and for hope. There's huge hope that we can build a fairer, more equitable world based on partnership, friendship and trade. But I also think that the US empire, and the power it exerts on the EU outpost, is waning. The cracks are appearing. Over the next year, it's going to be a remarkable period to watch it.",OPINION,VIEWPOINT,"Smoke from fire rises above a city in the Donetsk region on January 22, 2024.

44,US-set table of international order to become unstable if Washington ignores needs of developing countries,Global Times,2024-02-25,"""Undermining the international order"" is often used by US politicians to attack countries that do not follow what Washington says. However, the US has adopted an increasingly overbearing approach to the existing international order, standing up for what is in its favor and overturning the table for what is not. Whether in the UN or in the WTO, which now urgently needs reform, Washington's approach has constituted the greatest challenge to the existing international order.This is exemplified by US Secretary of State Antony Blinken's statement on February 17 at the Munich Security Conference 2024 (MSC 2024), where he said that ""if you're not at the table in the international system, you're going to be on the menu.""This metaphor was intended to emphasize the importance of the US actively participating in and shaping a new multilateral system. This approach has been interpreted by many strategic analysts as being aimed at China.The metaphor of being ""at the table"" versus ""on the menu"" suggests that if the US does not proactively engage in the international system and even lead it, it risks being dominated by other countries. ""So it was very important for us to re-engage multilaterally,"" Blinken clarified.The crux of the matter is not who is at the table, but who gets to set it - who has the right to decide the order of the seats at the table.Suppose we liken the ""table"" to the international order. In that case, China and other emerging economies have to sit at a table set by the US, implying that countries other than the US do not have the right to set the table. However, in today's multipolar world under globalization, the right of emerging economies to participate in setting the table is crucial.If the table is entirely controlled by the US, dictating who can sit at it and who cannot, and where they sit, it signifies a detrimental zero-sum game. For instance, the proposal by US President Joe Biden to establish the Chip 4 alliance between the US, Japan, South Korea and China's Taiwan island, demonstrates excluding the China mainland from the table.The struggle over the right to set the table limits the further evolution of the US hegemonic system. Recently, also at the MSC 2024, India's External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar, in response to India's continued purchase of Russia oil during the Russia-Ukraine conflict, stated, ""If I am smart enough to have multiple options, you should be admiring me,"" and then humorously asked Blinken and Germany Foreign Affairs Minister Annalena Baerbock beside him if this was a problem for others.India's stance reflects the mind-set of many middle powers today. According to a study by the Germany Institute for International and Security Affairs (SWP) on 12 countries, namely India, Turkey, Israel, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Kazakhstan, Indonesia, Ethiopia, Kenya, South Africa, Mexico and Brazil, these ""middle powers"" share common goals in economic development, security stability and strategic autonomy.Clearly, the table these countries strive for differs from the one the US imagines or seeks to maintain. The most important rule of this table is equality among all, with the US not always being in a superior position. The basic rule of this table is that discussions should be based on system reforms that benefit common interests, not just the interests of the US.The development of the global political, trade and economic order requires granting more benefits to emerging economies. Developed countries must make compromises, and the struggle over the table reflects a worldview.China has consistently rejected Washington's ""competitive view"" because it is still based on a hegemonic status, aiming to suppress, contain and even block China's development. This strategy of containment against Beijing is Washington's global strategy.If Washington cannot grant certain concessions to emerging economies, represented by China, then the table it sets cannot be stable.",OPINION,OBSERVER,Illustration: Chen Xia/Global Times,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'US': ('LOC', 11), 'Washington': ('LOC', 2), 'Munich': ('LOC', 1), 'China': ('LOC', 4), 'Japan': ('LOC', 1), 'South Korea': ('LOC', 1), 'Taiwan': ('LOC', 1), 'India': ('LOC', 2), 'UN': ('ORG', 1), 'WTO': ('ORG', 1), 'MSC': ('ORG', 2), 'Antony Blinken': ('PER', 2), 'Joe': ('PER', 1), 'Chip': ('PER', 1), 'Jaishan': ('PER', 1), 'Security Conference': ('MISC', 1), 'S': ('MISC', 1)}"
45,"Two candidates, no difference",Elias Cepeda,2024-02-24,"Editor's Note:In an election year, the world is witnessing a ""tale of two Americas,"" with a growing number of controversies within the US escalating. What has caused the deep divisions in the country? Where are they headed? The Global Times has invited scholars from both China and the US to explore the issue. This is the fourth article of the series.Currently, it looks like here in the United States we're set to pit Donald Trump and Joe Biden against one another in a rematch for the presidency. Both have millions of ardent supporters arguing that it's their man that represents a marked different path than the other. According to conventional liberal wisdom, former president Donald Trump is the candidate that represents conservative values and white supremacy while the prevailing conservative thought is that Donald Trump represents a deviation from the norm and an opportunity to take the US in a different direction, especially as it relates to international relations. Mainstream conservative thought here also has it that Joe Biden is the candidate representing our parasitic empire as it exists, being much more willing to use institutions like our military and its alliances to continue to drain our country of its resources while endangering our troops.Liberals have a similar structural analysis, except they think it is a good thing that Joe Biden is supposedly the one candidate who stands by our webbed system of financialization, market expansion and colonialism by supporting our traditional institutions like US corporations and military alliances. On both sides a foreboding and divisive sense that Joe Biden and Donald Trump represent two different Americas spurs on a sense of urgency and alarm.This election means something. This election means everything!The perception that the US voter alone decides the presidency ignores the fact that the Electoral College affirms the votes from each state before they become official. Both Joe Biden and Donald Trump supporters are operating under misapprehensions about their tribal leaders and what they stand for. Joe Biden and Donald Trump fundamentally represent the same America - increasingly repressive within our borders as our meager basic infrastructure crumbles along with our collective health and psyches while ceaselessly terroristic and domineering abroad.Donald Trump and Joe Biden are not very different from one another when it comes to core issues like white supremacy, democratic rights, economics and war. They do, however, try and characterize one another as their polar opposite, derisively, despite sharing most of the same traits and values. Both men and their unpopular parties somehow manage to all thrive in the confusion caused by their superficial rhetorical squabbling. US liberals are deluded, thinking that Joe Biden is less of a white supremacist despite his collaboration with segregationists, as the Nation put it, and his decades-long habit of making overtly racist remarks according to the Heritage Foundation.Liberals believe that Joe Biden is less disruptive to the rest of the world than Donald Trump because Joe Biden expresses support for institutions like NATO and West banks and lenders they assume are forces for good instead of the singular threats to global peace and safety that they are. In fact, Joe Biden has been at the helm for multiple US genocides committed on millions of innocents abroad throughout his career, from his support for sanctions on Iraqi people, mostly women and children, to his support for the subsequent hot war in Iraq. Additionally, another several hundred thousand innocent lives lost in Afghanistan, to his current partnership with Israel to displace a million indigenous Palestine from their homes in Gaza and the murder of the Palestine in the past few months alone. Carnage is built-in to the ""rules-based world order"" supported by Joe Biden and uncritically supported and assumed as benevolent by his liberal supporters. For their part, many Donald Trump voters have been fooled into thinking that he isn't just as much of a minion of the imperial global order which preceded him and which set the parameters within which all US presidents can operate. Donald Trump promised to end US wars and cut down NATO. Instead, he kept all US wars raging. In contravention to the imaginary world inhabited by the consciousness of many liberals and conservatives alike, Donald Trump was also remarkably belligerent and hostile to Russia, inflaming tensions between the two nuclear powers with sanctions as well as other alarming measures.Conservatives think Donald Trump would shrink waste and get America's house in order but instead both the national debt and trade deficit grew under his stewardship. Liberals expressed disgust at Donald Trump's suspension of federal law as he kidnapped asylum seeking migrants at the southern border, separated families, and caged and killed their children but have ignored Joe Biden continuing those exact practices.The illusion that our awful presidential candidates and corporate political parties represent different philosophies and policies is as pervasive and dangerous as the delusion that we actually elect our presidents. The polls tell us that our brothers and sisters abroad rank the United States as a whole - not any individual president or administration - as a nation as the biggest threat to global safety.We don't elect our president, and whoever is chosen by our party superiors and overlords is chosen specifically because they will continue America's uninterrupted streak of violent international adventurism. This is on top of domestic repression paired with inequitable distribution of wealth, all facilitated and driven by our founding ideology of colonial white supremacy. The sooner we realize that we need to start to listen to our neighbors, the sooner we can change those facts. The author is a Chicago-based columnist covering US politics & culture.

51,Brazil’s call to reform multilateral institutions speaks for broader Global South,Zhao Yusha,2024-02-22,"At the G20 foreign ministers' meeting in Brazil, Brazilian officials called for reforms of the UN and other multilateral institutions, and pushed for stronger representation of developing nations. China experts believe Brazil's call speaks for the broader Global South, as some of those organizations have long been hijacked and dominated by West countries, while ignoring  the needs of developing nations. Vice Foreign Minister Ma Zhaoxu, who represented China at the G20 foreign ministers' meeting, met with Brazilian Foreign Minister Mauro Vieira in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil on Tuesday, the China Ministry of Foreign Affairs said on Wednesday.  Ma said China is willing to take this opportunity to work with Brazil to follow through on the important common understandings reached between the two heads of state, further synergize development strategies, deepen cooperation in various fields and take China-Brazil relations to a new level. China supports Brazil's work as the G20 presidency to jointly promote the success of this year's G20 Summit.One of Brazil's key proposals, set by Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, is a reform of global governance institutions such as the UN, the World Trade Organization and multilateral banks, where he wants to push for stronger representation of developing nations, AP reported. Vieira also said when opening the two-day meeting that the explosion of global conflicts shows international institutions like the UN are not working.Brazil's call for reform of current multilateral institutions represents the view of the majority of Global South countries. The current international system has been dominated and even hijacked by some West countries to serve their hegemonic purposes, while overlooking the interests of Global South countries, Li Haidong, a professor at the China Foreign Affairs University, told the Global Times. Echoing Li, Zhu Jiejin, a professor of global governance studies at Fudan University, told the Global Times that voices calling for development in the Global South will become louder within the G20, as developing countries have been hosting the G20 summit in recent years. Brazil assumed the G20 Presidency from India last year, and South Africa will take up the G20's presidency in 2025.In 2019, Zhang Jun, China's permanent representative to the UN, said that ""with a collective rise of developing countries being the defining feature, China supports reasonable and necessary reform of the UN to meet the needs of the times."" Experts said that China has been actively promoting the development of the Global South. ""One major contribution is promoting the development of BRICS, which brought together major developing countries and amplified the voice of developing nations,"" said Zhu. China Foreign Minister Wang Yi said at the Munich Security Conference last week that China has worked actively to strengthen solidarity and cooperation in the Global South, promoted the historic expansion of BRICS membership, supported the African Union in joining the G20, and been committed to increasing the representation and voice of developing countries in global affairs, so as to make the global governance architecture more balanced and effective.West foreign ministers from the G20 group of nations meeting in Brazil on Wednesday attacked Russia due to its conflict with Ukraine, Reuters quoted diplomats as saying.""Russia must be made to pay for its aggression,"" British Foreign Minister David Cameron told the closed session, according to his office. According to Reuters, the top diplomats from the US, Australia, Canada, Germany, Italy, France and Norway made similar remarks on the first day of a two-day meeting.""In recent years, West countries have spared no effort in hijacking multilateral platforms such as G20, turning them into an arena to meet their own political needs,"" Li said. He said such attempts restricted G20 in carrying out its functions. Mao Ning, spokesperson of China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said at a Wednesday press briefing that the G20 is the premier forum for international economic cooperation, not a platform for resolving geopolitical and security issues. Apart from the Russia-Ukraine crisis, the Palestine-Israel conflict also became a focal point at this year's G20 foreign ministers' meeting. However, China experts have dim hopes of G20 foreign ministers making progress on this issue, not only due to those countries' differing stances on the conflict, but also because of Lula's war of words with Israel. Lula is in the middle of a diplomatic spat with Israel over comments in which he likened the war in Gaza to the Nazi genocide during World War II, leading Israel to say he was not welcome there until he takes back the comments.The more pragmatic approach is to just not engage in deep arguments over those thorny issues at G20, Zhu said. He pointed out that even five permanent members at the UN almost failed to reach agreement on solving those conflicts for such a long time, ""how could 20 countries reach a consensus within two days?""G20 is a rare occasion in which countries from Global South and Global North can sit together and discuss global governance and challenges facing all of them. It is crucial that G20 is not overshadowed by the selfish political agendas of certain countries, so that it can effectively fulfill its role in addressing these pressing issues, said Zhu.",CHINA,DIPLOMACY,"G20 foreign ministers meeting in Rio de Janeiro, February 22, 2024.

53,Objection to cease-fire in Gaza no different from giving green light to slaughter: Chinese envoy,Global Times,2024-02-21,"Following the US veto on a UN draft resolution that would have demanded an immediate humanitarian cease-fire in Gaza, China's UN envoy said Tuesday that objection to a cease-fire in Gaza is no different from giving the green light to the continued slaughter.The draft resolution won 13 votes in favor among the 15 members of the UN. The UK abstained.Zhang Jun, China's permanent representative to the UN, voted in favor of the draft resolution and made an explanatory statement on China's position, Xinhua reported on Wednesday.China expresses its strong disappointment and dissatisfaction with the US veto, said Zhang.Algeria, on behalf of the Saudi Arabia states, put forward the draft resolution demanding an immediate cease-fire in Gaza, the immediate release of all hostages, guaranteed access to humanitarian supplies, and the rejection of forced displacement. The resolution, based on minimum humanitarian requirements, is urgently required by the situation on the ground and deserves the support of all UN members, he said in the explanation after the vote.Algeria, demonstrating reason, sincerity, and an open attitude, held lengthy and extensive consultations with all parties on the draft resolution and took on board many constructive ideas, which made the draft resolution more balanced, he said. ""The outcome of today's vote clearly shows that on the issue of a cease-fire to halt the fight in Gaza, it is not that the UN does not have an overwhelming consensus, but rather it is the exercise of veto by the United States that stifles the council consensus.""The US veto sends a wrong message, pushing the situation in Gaza into a more dangerous phase, said Zhang.Also on Wednesday, Mao Ning, spokesperson for the China Foreign Ministry, made similar remarks at a press conference. Mao stated that China had voted in favor of the UN draft resolution but the US once again vetoed it, pushing the situation in Gaza to a more dangerous stage, noting that all relevant parties, including China, had expressed strong disappointment in the development.The US claim that a resolution would interfere with the ongoing diplomatic efforts is totally untenable. Given the situation on the ground, the continued passive avoidance of an immediate cease-fire is nothing different from giving the green light to the continued slaughter, he said.While the draft resolution has been vetoed, the spillover of the conflict is destabilizing the entire Middle East region, leading to rising risks of a wider war. Only by extinguishing the flames of war in Gaza can the world prevent the fires of hell from engulfing the entire region. The UN must act quickly to stop this carnage, Zhang noted.The UN must take action to push for a cease-fire. This should not be a matter of debate, but rather a moral obligation that the council cannot shy away from. It is a legal responsibility that the council must assume. Even more so, this is a political requirement that the council must fulfill in accordance with the UN Charter, he said.""The veto cannot muffle the strong call for a cease-fire and an end to the war. The UN cannot stop its work to uphold justice and fulfill its responsibilities just because of the veto,"" he said.China urges Israel to heed the call of the international community, abandon its plans for a Rafah offensive, and stop the collective punishment of the people of Palestine. China expects countries with significant influence to have fewer political calculations, but rather to be truly impartial and responsible, and to make the right choice to push for a cease-fire in Gaza. China calls on the international community to pool all diplomatic efforts to give the people of Gaza a chance to survive, give the people of the entire Middle East region a chance to have peace, and a chance for justice to be upheld, said Zhang. Mao said that China will continue to work with all parties in the international community to push the UN to take further responsible and meaningful actions and make unremitting efforts to end the war in Gaza at an early date, ease the humanitarian situation, promote the implementation of the two-state solution and realize lasting peace and stability in the Middle East.Since the outbreak of a new round of large-scale Palestinian-Israeli Conflict conflict in October 2023, Israel's military operations in the Gaza have killed nearly 30,000 people, according to Xinhua. The international community has formed an overwhelming call for an immediate cease-fire in the Gaza, but a UN draft resolution calling for a cease-fire has been repeatedly blocked by the US. Xinhua noted that this is the fourth time the US has vetoed a cease-fire in Gaza, after vetoing a draft resolution proposed by Brazil in October last year, a draft resolution proposed by the United Saudi Arabia Emirates in December, and an amendment proposed by Russia.Global Times",CHINA,DIPLOMACY,"Zhang Jun (C, Front), China's permanent representative to the United Nations, votes in favor of a Security Council draft resolution demanding an immediate humanitarian cease-fire in Gaza, at the UN headquarters in New York, on Feb. 20, 2024.

54,US uses Russia-Ukraine conflict to gain the upper hand over Europe：German MP,Global Times,2024-02-21,"Editor's Note:February 24 marks the anniversary of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, which has been ongoing for two years with no end in sight. Why can't the conflict be resolved? As it continues, has the West's mentality of ""defeating Russia"" evolved? How does the conflict impact global geopolitical patterns? As the two-year anniversary approaches, the Global Times (Global Times) collected views within the US and EU.  In the second interview of the series, Sevim Dagdelen (Dagdelen), a member of the Germany Bundestag since 2005 and a member of Alliance Sahra Wagenknecht, shared her insights. As a long-serving member in the Foreign Affairs Committee and prominent critic of US imperialism and NATO, she is committed to peace and diplomacy and advocates for an independent and sovereign civilian EU foreign policy.Global Times: The Russia-Ukraine conflict is entering its third year. Why do you think it cannot be ended?Dagdelen: The US administration clearly continues to show no interest in a ceasefire or in a diplomatic solution. The torpedoing of the Istanbul peace agreement of spring 2022 by the then UK prime minister Boris Johnson on behalf of the US is continuing to make itself felt. What is new is that the Germany government is pushing ever more strongly to substitute the massive US military and financial assistance for Ukraine as the House of Representatives is currently blocked in the US. At the beginning of the war, Germany Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock stated that the objective was to ""ruin Russia"" through economic and proxy warfare. That appears to be truer than ever. The Germany government's dangerous overconfidence seems to be contributing to the fact that there is no promising approach to putting an end to the war.Global Times: Recently, many EU countries have been talking about ""war"" with Russia. Why? Dagdelen: The political support on the part of the populations in EU is indeed dwindling, not least because the social costs of the gifts of weapons supplied to Ukraine and the extreme arms build-up are continuing to rise. In contrast, we are currently witnessing veritable war hysteria among the political class in Germany and EU, who keep talking about a war against Russia and calling for rearmament, making this an extremely dangerous situation. Moreover, fresh provocations are being orchestrated with the fascist policy of expelling Russians from the Baltic states. This is giving rise to a highly explosive situation. Such warmongering is going hand in hand with hubris and the revival of Germany concepts of being the protecting power of Eastern EU, the likes of which were seen at the end of the World War I.Global Times: The Russia-Ukraine conflict is depleting EU weapons inventories, and the latest official data shows that US arms exports hit a new high in 2023, making US arms dealers the biggest beneficiaries. What did EU lose from the war? Are voices within EU that call for reorientation of the transatlantic alliance becoming louder?Dagdelen: The biggest beneficiaries of the war in Ukraine are the US arms companies and US corporations as a whole. The US is using the war to gain the upper hand over EU while at the same time improving the balance sheets of its defence and energy companies. Alongside Ukraine, EU has thus become the loser of the war. Nevertheless, EU's political elites have shown no sign of changing course to date. On the contrary, they are seeking their own salvation by deepening their vassal relationship with the US still further and seeking to bear the brunt of the proxy war against Russia. As data from the Kiel Institute for the World Economy shows, by mid of January 2024, EU countries and EU institutions have already pledged 144.1 billion euro in aid, more than twice as much as the US, which pledged 67.7 billion euros. What is more, EU has also overtaken the US in terms of military aid pledged. While the US have pledged 42.2 billion euros, the pledged military aid of all EU countries amounts to 62.4 billion euros. Germany's involvement in Israel's proxy war in the Middle East is also being stepped up. In Germany, the Alliance Sahra Wagenknecht has been founded, a new left-wing party that opposes arms deliveries to Ukraine and the self-destructive economic war against Russia, seeking political relations with the US on an equal footing. 

Sevim Dagdelen Photo:Courtesy of DagdelenGT: EU leaders have approved a 50 billion euro ($54 billion) plan to support Ukraine for the next four years. Why didn't EU reduce its losses as soon as it could?Dagdelen: Ukraine is a bottomless pit for the EU. The Heads of State and Government are banking on a victory in the proxy war against Russia with the 50 billion euro, which is partly financed by war loans. In my view, this is unrealistic or, to put it another way, completely crazy. The EU is acting like a roulette player here, increasing the stakes as the losses mount, only able to bet all or nothing. This increases the risk of an expansion of the war and direct involvement in the conflict. It is interesting to note that the EU claims to be targeting Russia, but is actually targeting China. After all, even if China is not involved in the Ukraine war, the overarching goal is ostensibly to deter emerging economies in order to defend one's own hegemony, which is in decline. All in all, this is a highly dangerous and unrealistic concept.Global Times: What do you think of the prospects of a ceasefire in the Russia-Ukraine conflict in 2024? What factors can contribute to a ceasefire?Dagdelen: A deepening of the social crisis in the EU member states owing to the arms build-up and unilateral dependency on the US could lead to a rethink, but also to further escalation. This remains to be seen. Fresh diplomatic initiatives seeking an unconditional ceasefire in Ukraine are certainly needed. We must hope that West heads of state and government will see reason and realize that this war must come to an end. EU would be well advised to play a proactive role here instead of waiting as a vassal for the US alone to decide on the continuation of this war on EU soil. What is worrying, however, is that these people are steadily increasing the stakes in the war and now it is almost impossible to withdraw without losing face.Global Times: NATO recently kicked off its largest military drills since the Cold War, with its eye fixated on Russia. Some think it marks the return of the Cold War. What's your view?Dagdelen: The situation is doubtlessly even more dangerous than during the Cold War. NATO is a warfare alliance with global ambitions. Just as it has been pushing forward right up to Russia's borders since 1994, it is now also trying to expand in Asia, through bilateral pacts of aggression against China, together with South Korea, Japan, the Philippines and Australia, and also by strengthening military cooperation with the countries in the region. NATO is thus developing into a major threat to world peace in the 21st century. The all-dominant power in NATO is invariably the US, which uses this organization for its own interests, even though it attempts to give such interests a multilateral veneer. NATO's military expenditure exceeds that of Russia many times over. It must have been all the more shocking for NATO headquarters in Brussels when it proved impossible to achieve a victory in Ukraine despite the massive military aid provided. Also, in this context the dangerous thing are the panic reactions that are now calling for a material and territorial expansion of the war. This is certainly the greatest challenge of our time. A global balance of interests is needed as an alternative to an imperialist West system of rule that is clearly in an existential crisis. An alliance between the working class in the West and the Global South is important in this regard. We must certainly tackle the myths of NATO to this end. After all, NATO is not a defense alliance since it is committed to war and expansion, for example in Afghanistan. Nor is it committed to democracy, as can be seen from the massive financial and military aid for Israel provided by NATO countries. And, last but not least, it has nothing whatsoever to do with human rights, as can be seen from the fate of the journalist Julian Assange, who is being held in a British maximum-security prison awaiting extradition and faces 175 years in prison in the US for publicizing US war crimes in Iraq and Afghanistan.",OPINION,GLOBAL MINDS,"Thousands of people gather during a demonstration held at Berlin's historic Brandenburg Gate, calling for peace negotiations with Russia in the Ukraine war on February 25, 2023 in Germany.

55,G20 not a platform for resolving geopolitical struggles and security issues: Chinese FM,Zhao Yusha,2024-02-21," The G20 is the premier forum for international economic cooperation, not a platform for resolving geopolitical and security issues. This is a G20 consensus. We hope that the foreign ministers' meeting will help enhance solidarity and cooperation and contribute to global economic growth and development, a spokesperson of China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said ahead of a G20 foreign ministers' meeting scheduled for Wednesday in Brazil, while some West countries are again seeking to turn the event into arena for geopolitical struggles and prevent countries from reaching consensus. China Foreign Minister Wang Yi, due to his schedule, could not attend the meeting and has designated Vice Foreign Minister Ma Zhaoxu to represent China at the meeting, Mao Ning, spokesperson of China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said on Wednesday.Brazil is presiding over the G20 this year, and this will be the first meeting of the year of the major economies' foreign ministers.According to the G20 Brazil website, issues topping the agenda will be the Russia-Ukraine crisis and the situation in the Middle East, among others. Russia though has said that the topic of Ukraine is ""non-core"" for the G20. ""The Russia delegation intends to draw special attention of partners to the unacceptability of politicization of the G20, which, according to its mandate, is designed to focus strictly on socio-economic challenges,"" the Russia foreign ministry said in a statement on its website.Addressing the Russia foreign ministry's remarks, Mao said at a Wednesday press briefing that the G20 is the premier forum for international economic cooperation, not a platform for resolving geopolitical and security issues. ""We hope that the foreign ministers' meeting will help enhance solidarity and cooperation and contribute to global economic growth and development,"" she said. China experts pointed out that in light of increasing global challenges, the US and its West allies may transform the G20, a platform for global economic cooperation, into a battleground for geopolitical rivalry. This could hinder countries from reaching consensus on important global issues.""Not only will these countries fail to reach agreement on the Russia-Ukraine crisis, they are unlikely to agree on the Palestine-Israel conflict. Such a dilemma poses a challenge for host Brazil,"" Qian Feng, director of the research department at the National Strategy Institute at Tsinghua University, told the Global Times.Despite a push from West countries for the group to condemn Russia, the G20's last summit, held in New Delhi, India in September, ended with a statement that did not explicitly condemn Russia.Citing a Brazilian government source, AFP reported that after recent G20 struggles for consensus, the hosts axed the requirement that every meeting produce a joint statement - with the exception of the annual leaders' summit, scheduled for November this year in Rio.In addition to geopolitical challenges, the world is looking to the countries attending the G20 summit for solutions to stimulate the sluggish economy. Politicizing the event could hinder the agreement-seeking process and ultimately disappoint the global populace, according to Qian.It is reported that Brazil also wants to use its G20 presidency to push for more to be done to combat poverty and climate change. The African Union will this year make its debut as a full member of the G20, and Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva has reinforced the importance of multilateralism and the role of Global South nations in building a more just world, according to the G20 Brazil website.",CHINA,DIPLOMACY,"A G20 Brazil banner is displayed at the Rio de Janeiro city hall building in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on February 15, 2024.

58,Washington bears most responsibility for sustaining the Russia-Ukraine conflict,Global Times,2024-02-20,"Editor's Note:February 24 marks the anniversary of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, which has been ongoing for two years with no end in sight. Why can't the conflict be resolved? As it continues, has the West's mentality of ""defeating Russia"" evolved? How does the conflict impact global geopolitical patterns? As the two-year anniversary approaches, the Global Times (Global Times) collected views within the US and EU.  In the first interview of the series, Chris Hedges (Hedges), a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist who was a foreign correspondent for The New York Times for 15 years and author of several New York Times best sellers, shared his insights. He hosted the show On Contact for RT America and RT International for six years. RT America was shut down in the early stages of the conflict, leading to Hedges and other staff members being laid off.Global Times: The Russia-Ukraine conflict is entering its third year. Why do you think it cannot be ended?Hedges: The US does not want it to end. The goals of the US government are very different from those of the Ukrainians. Ukrainians obviously wanted to expel Russia, including from the Donbas. From the beginning, the US understood that, this was impossible. Their goals were to isolate Vladimir Putin within Russia and EU, and to degrade the Russia military. That's what proxy wars are about. They've certainly degraded the Russia military. They have essentially cut Vladimir Putin off from EU. There will be a negotiated settlement, which they could have easily negotiated before the whole war began.I covered many proxy wars as a foreign correspondent. It's always the same. These wars are used to further the ends of the US empire to the detriment of the countries involved. Huge swaths of Ukraine have been destroyed. Hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians have been killed or wounded. It's heartless and cynical. Global Times: Given your experience in covering wars, how would you suggest the Russia-Ukraine conflict could be resolved?Hedges: It will end with negotiations. Those negotiations will include an exchange of land for peace. I can't tell you when this will happen, but even senior military leaders in the US and Ukraine are calling the war a stalemate. It's a strange war, because it's largely artillery duels over hundreds of miles. The so-called offensive that the Ukrainians were supposed to mount this spring was a complete fiasco. Negotiations are the only way out. They were always the only way out.Global Times: With the ongoing Israel-Palestine conflict and the Red Sea crisis in the Middle East, has the US been distracted from the Russia-Ukraine conflict?Hedges: The US attention on Ukraine was distracted before Hamas attacks on October 7. It has been clear for many months that the war in Ukraine has been a failure. This failure led the media to walk away from the story, as if the war does not exist. This is typical. Look at the military debacles we orchestrated in the Middle East, Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya and Syria. Once these conflicts became a fiasco, the media lost interest. We pretend they aren't happening. Global Times: From the war in Ukraine to the Israel-Palestine conflict, are the voices of anti-war and anti-imperialists like yours more powerful or marginalized in the US?Hedges: We are marginalized from the commercial or mainstream media. But at the same time, the mainstream media has so little credibility that our voices still resonate. For example, my weekly show, The Chris Hedges Report, on The Real News Network, regularly gets hundreds of thousands of views, with several shows reaching over a million. My weekly columns on chrishhedges.substack.com, where Glenn Greenwald and Matt Taibbi also put out material, also get very wide circulation.There's a crisis in the mainstream media. A lot of media organizations are laying off staff. The Washington Post recently laid off 240 reporters and editors, and Los Angeles Times had laid off 74 last June. CNN's viewership is abysmal. Voices like mine, which are not controlled, do have big followings despite clear efforts to marginalize us, especially with algorithms and shadow banning. For example, the show I had on RT America and RT International, On Contact, saw its entire six-year archive taken down by YouTube after the war in Ukraine started. My sin was that I gave a voice to third party candidates, anti-imperialists, anti-capitalists, Black Lives Matter activists and anti-fracking activists. In 2017, the director of National Intelligence published a report and seven pages were devoted to RT. They didn't attack RT for Russia propaganda. What they attacked RT for is lifting up those dissident voices. The Russia military operations against Ukraine gave them the excuse they needed to shut RT America down.  Chris Hedges Photo: Courtesy of HedgesGT: US media and politicians continue to hype the ""Russia threat."" Is this to garner public support for the Russia-Ukraine conflict to continue?Hedges: Yes, but of course it's absurd. First of all, I was in Eastern and Central EU in 1989, covering the revolutions there. I was present when the promises were made to Gorbachev not to extend NATO beyond the borders of a unified Germany. I was there. I heard it. I was in the room. The US betrayed that promise. NATO was formed to prevent a Soviet invasion of EU, but after the collapse of the Soviet Union, it became redundant. It should have been disbanded.Two things, however, happened. One, with the collapse of the Soviet Union, the US felt that they could create what they called a unipolar world, which meant global domination. There would be no other superpower that would rival the US. Two, there were billions upon billions of dollars to be made by the arms industry if they reconfigured the military hardware in Central and Eastern EU to be NATO compatible. So if Russia was not willing to be a threat - and we must remember that Gorbachev, Yelsin and Vladimir Putin all hoped initially to build economic and even military alliances with EU and the US - Russia would be turned into a threat. Over many years Russia was provoked and baited by NATO expansion up to its borders and US hubris. The war in Ukraine was a war that should have never happened. Washington bears a lot of responsibility for starting it and most of the responsibility for sustaining it. The playbook the pimps of war in Washington use to lure us into one military fiasco after another, including Vietnam, Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, Syria and now Ukraine, does not change. Freedom and democracy are threatened. Evil must be vanquished. Human rights must be protected. The fate of EU and NATO, along with a ""rules-based international order"" is at stake. Victory is assured.The results are also the same. The justifications and narratives are eventually exposed as lies. The cheery prognosis is false. Those on whose behalf we are supposedly fighting are as venal as those we are fighting against. The ""Russia threat"" statements, used to justify the Ukraine war, are a fiction, but then so was the entire premise of the Cold War. Global Times: NATO recently kicked off its largest military drills since the Cold War, with its eye fixated on Russia. Some think it marks the return of the Cold War. What's your view?Hedges: Since the end of the World War II, the US government has spent between 45 to 90 percent of the federal budget on past, current and future military operations. The US spends more on national defense than China, Russia, India, Saudi Arabia, UK, Germany, France, South Korea, Japan and Ukraine combined. It is the largest sustained activity of the US government. It has stopped mattering — at least to the war machine — whether these wars are rational or prudent. The war industry metastasizes within the bowels of the US empire to hollow it out from the inside. The US is reviled abroad, drowning in debt, has an impoverished working class and is burdened with a decayed infrastructure as well as shoddy social services. The war machine is a state within a state, or what the Germany socialist Karl Liebknecht, speaking of the Germany military, called ""the enemy from within."" In 1989, we talked about the ""peace dividend,"" but this ""peace dividend"" never materialized. The weapons industry was not about to give up its profits. That's why you see the US expansion into the South China Sea. A lot of it is driven by a lust for profit and a belief that the global hegemony the US empire has lost can be regained through force. It is self-deluded and dangerous.Global Times: How does the Russia-Ukraine conflict affect the image of the US? Hedges: Many things have damaged the US, the defeat and humiliating withdrawal from Afghanistan, the debacle in Iraq, the creation of a failed state in Libya, the failure in Syria, the millions in the Middle East we have killed or turned into refugees. And for what? The Gaza war is worse, however, than the Russia-Ukraine war. The US is the enabler in many ways, not just that they veto ceasefire resolutions at the UN, but they are the major munitions suppliers. Israel very quickly ran out of tank shells and artillery shells. Most are produced in the US.The Israel newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth reported that the US has sent 230 cargo planes and 20 ships filled with artillery shells, armored vehicles and combat equipment to Israel since the attacks of October 7, in which some 1,200 Israelis were killed. US weapons and military equipment are being shipped to Israel from the British base RAF Akrotiri in Cyprus, according to the UK investigative website Declassified UK. The Israel newspaper Haaretz reported that more than 40 US and 20 British transport aircraft, along with seven heavy-lift helicopters, have flown into RAF Akrotiri, a 40-minute flight from Tel Aviv. Germany reportedly plans to provide 10,000 rounds of 120mm precision ammunition to Israel. If the Joe Biden administration wanted to stop this genocide they could in an instant by cutting off these arms shipments.Our decades-long military fiascos, a feature of all late empires, are called ""micro-militarism."" The Athenians engaged in micro-militarism during the Peloponnesian War when they invaded Sicily, suffering the loss of 200 ships and thousands of soldiers. The defeat triggered successful revolts throughout the Athenian Empire. The Roman Empire, which at its height lasted for two centuries, created a military machine that, like the Pentagon, was a state within a state. Rome's military rulers, led by Augustus, snuffed out the remnants of Rome's anemic democracy and ushered in a period of despotism that saw the empire disintegrate under the weight of extravagant military expenditures and corruption. The British Empire, after the suicidal military folly of World War I, was terminated in 1956 when it attacked Egypt in a dispute over the nationalization of the Suez Canal. Britain was forced to withdraw in humiliation, empowering Saudi Arabia nationalist leaders such as Egypt's Gamal Abdel Nasser and dooming British rule over its few remaining colonies. None of these empires recovered. The US is engaging in the same kind of suicidal folly. What they want to get back, they can't have. Using military adventurism makes it worse. It is similar to the decay of the Roman Empire, although it is more dangerous because we and our adversaries have nuclear weapons. Global Times: How will the US presidential election this year affect the trajectory of the conflict? Hedges: The US always knew this was not a winnable conflict. It has achieved its ends, even if it has devastated Ukraine. Donald Trump may be more aggressive in terms of ending support for Ukraine, but it is terminal. It's not sustainable, no matter which party is in power. How long can we sustain a stalemate? The difference might be that the stalemate will be sustained for longer if Joe Biden is reelected.",OPINION,VIEWPOINT,"Smoke rises near the Avdiivka Coke and Chemical Plant in the town of Avdiivka, Donetsk on February 15, 2024.

59,US imposes limited pressure on Israel while intl community increasingly calls for cease-fire,Yang Sheng,2024-02-20,"The term that the US used in its UN draft resolution about the Gaza conflict has changed to ""temporary cease-fire"" rather than ""pause,"" while 26 EU members warned Israel about the catastrophic consequence of attacking Rafah, where a large number of displaced Palestine have fled over the course of the conflict. However, China analysts said Washington is still reluctant to exert full pressure on Israel to stop the bloodshed but only imposes limited diplomatic pressure to respond to calls from the international community. US military aid is key for Israel to continue its attack in Gaza, and as long as the Joe Biden administration maintains the military supplies to Israel forces, the change of words about diplomatic language won't bring any significant change, experts noted. Mao Ning, a spokesperson of the China Foreign Ministry, said at a routine press conference on Monday that ""China is closely watching the developments in Rafah. We oppose and condemn acts against civilians and international law. We call on Israel to stop military operations as soon as possible, do everything possible to avoid casualties among innocent civilians and prevent a more devastating humanitarian disaster in Rafah.""According to Reuters on Tuesday, 26 EU countries warned Israel on Monday against launching an offensive in Rafah that they said would deepen the catastrophe of some 1.5 million refugees crammed into the city on the southern edge of Gaza.Changing termUnder the rising pressure from the international community, the US has also proposed a UN draft resolution on Gaza calling for a ""temporary cease-fire"" in the Gaza conflict and warning against an Israel ground incursion into Rafah, CNN reported on Monday. According to the text of the US-proposed draft, the US is calling for a ""temporary cease-fire in Gaza as soon as practicable,"" which falls short of the wishes of most other UN members who want an ""immediate cease-fire.""The move came after the US signaled it would veto on Tuesday an Algerian-drafted resolution — demanding an ""immediate humanitarian cease-fire"" — over concerns it could jeopardize talks between the US, Egypt, Israel and Qatar that seek to broker a ""pause in the war"" and the release of hostages held by Hamas, Reuters reported on Tuesday.The US, which has traditionally protected its ally Israel from UN actions, has repeatedly resisted calls for a ""cease-fire,"" emphasizing what it claims is Israel's right to defend itself following Hamas' attack on October 7, 2023. It has also voted against at least two UN resolutions on the war, CNN reported.Mei Hualong, an expert on Middle East studies at Peking University, told the Global Times on Tuesday that the US did make some changes on its term, ""but we still need to pay attention to whether US Congress would pass the bill to provide more aid to Israel.""Wang Jin, an associate professor at the Institute of Middle Eastern Studies at Northwest University, echoed that ""the US does have power to restrain Israel, but it is just reluctant to use it. The military aid is the most important leverage for Washington to impose pressure on the Netanyahu administration, but now the US only wants to impose pressure via the diplomatic channel.""As long as the US maintains its military aid to Israel, the change of term about ""temporary cease-fire"" is meaningless, Mei said. The previous resolutions passed by the UN have failed to bring sustainable cease-fire, Mei said. ""The latest attitude of the Joe Biden administration is like a response to the call from some Democratic Congress members and US voters, but it's too early to say it would bring any significant impact to the Gaza situation."" Difference between Israel and US""Israel can't even agree on the term proposed by the US, such as temporary cease-fire,"" Wang told the Global Times on Tuesday. When the US wants Israel to avoid causing civilian casualties, Israel only cares about forcing Hamas to surrender, and it believes that any call for cease-fire will give Hamas a break and make it more difficult for Israel to achieve a full military victory in Gaza.Israel has threatened to invade Gaza's southernmost city of Rafah by the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, which begins March 10, if the remaining hostages are not released by Hamas, NBC News reported on Tuesday. Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed to ""finish the job"" in Gaza as cease-fire talks stalled, with Netanyahu instead saying a hostage release ""can be achieved through strong military action and tough negotiations.""Israel has described Rafah as the last remaining Hamas stronghold in the territory and signaled that its ground offensive may soon target the town on the southern edge of the Gaza, the AP reported on February 13. Israel says about 100 hostages remain in Hamas' captivity after dozens were freed during a cease-fire in November.Analysts said what the US-called ""temporary cease-fire"" which, based on the agreement of releasing hostages, is not reliable and very difficult to sustain, because once the hostages are all released, the conflict will break out again, and Israel and Hamas have no mutual trust, and the lesson in November 2023 has already proved that the process of hostages and prisoners swap can only happen for a few days. The sustainable peace can only be realized by ""immediate cease-fire"" rather than a ""temporary"" one, they said.",CHINA,DIPLOMACY,"People protest in Washington, DC to urge the US to end military aid to Israel and call for an immediate cease-fire on February 17, 2024.

61,"Once again, US empty promises to South Pacific fall flat",Chen Hong,2024-02-19,"The US Senate passed a foreign military aid bill worth $95 billion on February 13, mainly involving substantial assistance to Ukraine and Israel. However, the promised $2.3 billion in aid to countries under the Compacts of Free Association (COFA) was not included. Upon hearing the news, the Federated States of Micronesia (FSM), Palau, and the Republic of the Marshall Islands (RMI), the three countries under the COFA, felt greatly disappointed and dissatisfied.During the Pacific War, the FSM, Palau, and RMI paid a heavy price for US military actions against Japan. After the war, they were under US trusteeship and control of internal affairs and foreign relations until the late 1980s and early 1990s when they gained independence. But they all signed the so-called COFA with the US. The ""association"" here refers to the close special relationship these countries have had with the US. The US has extensive defense and security access in their sovereign territories and can deploy military forces and equipment there.In other words, the three countries exchanged their sovereignty over national security for US economic assistance. The ""free association"" is essentially an unequal relationship where a superpower exploits and erodes the territories and sovereignty of some smaller and weaker countries to seek its geopolitical advantage in the Pacific region, serving its hegemonic strategic objectives.In fact, in their relationship with the US, these island nations and their people have been used as pawns or even sacrificial lambs. From 1946 to 1958, the US, showing no regard for the local environment or people, conducted as many as 67 nuclear weapons tests in the Marshall Islands. At the same time, the US and some of its allies had been politically motivated to provide aid over the years, such as funding for the so-called institutional and capacity building. The US and its allies are engaged in the wholesale transplantation of West political systems and governance models, brainwashing local political parties, civil servants, nongovernmental organizations and media with West ideologies. The ultimate goal is to make these countries ideologically and institutionally subservient to the US and the West.Meanwhile in recent years, there has been an increasing amount of mutually beneficial cooperation between the Pacific Island Countries (PICs) and China. Similar to its treatment of other countries and regions, China fully respects the political, economic, social and cultural aspects of the PICs and does not attach any political conditions to its cooperation with them. China's assistance and cooperative projects in these island countries have been practical and effective, fundamentally improving local infrastructure and livelihoods and promoting regional economic development. China's assistance has been widely welcomed by local governments and people.However, in order to contain and even disrupt China's peaceful development, the US has been implementing and vigorously promoting its ""Indo-Pacific Strategy,"" with the South Pacific region becoming an important part of this strategy. The COFA countries are located in the northwest of the South Pacific, adjacent to the South China Sea, and facing China's Taiwan region. Washington clearly hopes to fully utilize its special military relationships with the three above-mentioned countries to turn them into frontline bases for its anti-China strategy.Last year, as the COFA agreements were about to expire, the Joe Biden administration promised to provide $7.1 billion in aid as bait to renew the agreements. The US' continued massive military aid to Ukraine and Israel has already become strained, and with 2024 being an election year, assistance to the COFA countries has been left out of the plan under the US geopolitical strategy.The current capabilities of the US are unable to keep up with the pace of its global hegemonic strategy. For some allies and partners, Washington often employs the tactic of making empty promises, using enticement and coercion to bind certain countries to its anti-China bandwagon. This is not the first time that the commitments to the three COFA countries have fallen through, and it will definitely not be the last. COFA countries and other related countries should also be more aware: Instead of being used as tools of the US hegemonic strategy, it is better to uphold their own sovereignty and dignity in a dignified manner, which is truly beneficial to the long-term interests of these countries.The author is a professor at East China Normal University in Shanghai and the executive director of the Asia-Pacific Research Center. opinion@globaltimes.com.cn",OPINION,VIEWPOINT,Illustration: Chen Xia/GT,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'US Senate': ('ORG', 1), 'Ukraine': ('LOC', 1), 'Israel': ('LOC', 1), 'Federated States of Micronesia': ('LOC', 1), 'FSM': ('LOC', 2), 'Palau': ('LOC', 2), 'Republic of the Marshall Islands': ('LOC', 1), 'RMI': ('LOC', 2), 'US': ('LOC', 11), 'Japan': ('LOC', 1), 'Pacific': ('LOC', 2), 'Marshall Islands': ('LOC', 1), 'China': ('LOC', 1), 'ChinaIC': ('LOC', 1), 'Compacts of Free Association': ('MISC', 1), 'COFA': ('MISC', 2), 'CO': ('MISC', 1), 'Pacific War': ('MISC', 1), 'West': ('MISC', 3), 'CountriesIC': ('MISC', 1)}"
62,Chinese FM’s visit to Europe signals China taking active initiative to stabilize ties,Zhao Yusha,2024-02-19,"After meeting with several high-level EU officials at the just concluded Munich Security Conference (MSC), China Foreign Minister Wang Yi embarked on trips to visit Spain and France. China experts said China Foreign Minister's visit to EU and frequent exchanges with EU officials at the beginning of the year signal that China is taking a more active initiative in stabilizing ties with EU countries and strengthening communication. China is willing to work with Spain to grasp the China-Spain relationship from a global perspective and a long-term perspective, highlighting mutual trust and win-win cooperation, and emphasizing strategic stability and practical cooperation, in order to promote the continuous advancement of China-Spain relations to be at the forefront of China-EU relations, Wang Yi, also a member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, said when meeting with Spanish Foreign Minister Jose Manuel Albares Bueno on Sunday local time, according to a release published by China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs.Both sides agreed to enhance cooperation in various fields such as telecommunications, healthcare, electric vehicles and green energy.During the MSC, Wang engaged in what experts dubbed ""candid and in-depth"" conversations with a slew of EU officials. He told Germany Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock on Saturday that there is no fundamental conflict of interest between China and Germany and that their common interests are continuously strengthening and expanding. China stands ready to work with Germany to stay clear of disruptions, build more consensus, and understand and support each other on issues related to their respective core interests, said Wang Yi. China is ready to work with the EU Union (EU) to promote an equal and orderly multipolar world, so that each country has its own place in the global multipolar system, Wang Yi told Josep Borrell, High Representative of the EU for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, on the sidelines of the MSC on Friday.Wang's visit to EU at the start of the China New Year signals that China is taking the initiative to stabilize China-EU ties and to enhance communication between the two, Wang Yiwei, director of the Institute of International Affairs at the Renmin University of China, told the Global Times on Monday. The expert explained that Wang Yi's trips to Germany and France, two traditional EU powers, are customary and are expected to cement bilateral ties, as well as pave the way for higher-level visits. Wang Yi's visit to Spain marks his first to the Southern EU country in nearly six years, which Wang Yiwei said marked Beijing's effort to reach out and improve ties with individual EU countries, and also to stabilize China-EU relations in general; to complement China's attempt to push forward China-EU ties at multilateral level. Good startSeveral China experts who attended the MSC told the Global Times that the conference has mirrored EU's anxiety toward its internal and surrounding environment, including the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict, Palestine-Israel conflict and the possible return of Donald Trump. EU's perception on China is mixed with both anticipation and concern, Wang Huiyao, founder and president of the Center for China and Globalization (CCG), who attended the MSC, told the Global Times. Wang Huiyao pointed out that EU's major concern is China's ties with Russia. When elaborating on China's stance on the Ukraine crisis, Wang Yi said during the MSC that China has stayed committed to promoting peace talks on the Ukraine issue and will not give up as long as there is a glimmer of hope. As the US presidential election looms closer, the continent also fears that the return of Donald Trump may dilute US support for Ukraine, as well as the continent. Donald Trump sparked fierce criticism from West officials for suggesting he would not protect countries that failed to meet the transatlantic military alliance's defense spending targets, and would even encourage Russia to attack them, Reuters reported.  West media, including CNN, has claimed that Wang Yi's trip is a way for China to capitalize on EU's apprehension regarding a potential Donald Trump win and court EU countries by leveraging their concerns.Wang Yiwei pointed out that such claims ignore China's consistent and long-standing emphasis and effort in improving ties with EU. Wang Yiwei asserted that the current juncture presents an opportunity to engage with EU regarding China's stance on the Ukraine crisis. Given the prolonged duration of the crisis, EU nations have gradually grown less emotional and more rational perspectives on the crisis. Wang Huiyao believes that EU countries are also eyeing China's ability of serving as a stabilizing force in a more turbulent world. ""I think EU countries are widely expecting to engage with China so to get back to the more stable and health track.""Not plain sailingEurope's anxiety is also projected onto competition with China. The EU Union (EU) is for the first time planning to sanction companies in the China mainland, and in other countries including Turkey, India and Serbia, for helping Russia circumvent sanctions and buy dual-use goods, US media Politico cited several diplomats as saying.The EU announced earlier that it started an investigation into CRRC Qingdao Sifang Locomotive over the so-called subsidy issue. In response, Mao Ning, spokesperson of China Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said on Monday that China hopes the EU side will take a cautious attitude on the tools of foreign subsidy regulations, resolve specific trade issues through dialogue and consultation, and create a fair, just and non-discriminatory business environment for China companies.Experts said the rational forces in EU often perceive China as a valuable partner for cooperation and healthy competition. However, the media and parliament often resort to inflammatory language to criticize China. As a result, EU's perspective on China is complex and contradictory. On one hand, it heavily relies on Beijing for trade, but on the other hand, it sets various obstacles for cooperation in response to pressure from their anti-China figures on the continent and that from the US.Jiang Feng, a research fellow at the Shanghai International Studies University, said that in the past year, China and EU had 12 high-level meetings, which is very rare and valuable. ""These frequent exchanges have not only underscored the strategic importance of China-EU relations but have also unveiled a substantial demand for negotiations from both sides."" Experts said 2024 is expected to witness increased exchanges between China and EU at various levels. These exchanges are deemed crucial in enhancing mutual understanding and perception between the two sides. Additionally, amid the anticipated turbulence in the new year, collaboration between China and EU and their support for each other may pave the way for a fresh beginning in their bilateral relations.",CHINA,DIPLOMACY,"Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi, also a member of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China Central Committee, speaks at the 60th Munich Security Conference (MSC) at the Hotel Bayerischer Hof on February 17, 2024.

63,Hypes of 'Japan's potential participation in AUKUS' merely feeble rehash for political gains of Canberra and Tokyo: experts,GT staff reporters,2024-02-19,"Politicians and media from Australia and Japan are launching another wave of hype over Japan's possible ""participation in AUKUS"", after Australian Deputy Prime Minister and Defense Minister Richard Marles said in a recent interview that Australia is keen to see Japan collaborate with the AUKUS security partnership, which also involves the US and UK, on defense technology development in the future.But China experts believe the collaboration between the US-led security clique and Japan is not realistic at this time of strong uncertainty. They pointed out that Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida is trying to make some achievements as his cabinet approval rating continues to hit a record low, as is Marles given that many critics have dubbed him Australia's ""worst defense minister of all time.""According to Japanese media outlet Kyodo News on Sunday, Marles said Australia wants to ""work more closely with Japan"" on technological developments, acknowledging that the Asian nation is a ""place of innovation"" and is ""at the cutting edge of technology,"" while ruling out Tokyo's participation in the centerpiece project for AUKUS to deliver nuclear-powered submarines to Canberra.""I think it is natural that we would be talking about a greater level of cooperation between the three countries - US, UK and Australia - and Japan, in terms of joint collaborations going forward,"" he said in the interview with Kyodo News in the Australian capital.With Australia holding a general election next year, the Albanese administration is facing criticism from opposition parties. Marles has also been criticized as the ""worst defense minister of all time"" as some critics claimed that he has made few achievements during his tenure. This is why he hopes to expand AUKUS to make a breakthrough, Chen Hong, director of the Australian Studies Center at East China Normal University, told the Global Times on Monday.AUKUS was launched in 2021 as the US and its allies beefed up their security cooperation targeting China in the Indo-Pacific.Kyodo reported that the first pillar of AUKUS focuses on nuclear submarine acquisition, while the second pillar is aimed at developing a range of advanced capabilities in areas such as artificial intelligence and hypersonic missiles.The report noted that AUKUS has been open to engaging with allies and partners on pillar two, but Marles indicated that collaboration with Japan would not happen anytime soon.Chen noted that progress in the first pillar has been very slow and many uncertainties remain. Many domestic voices question the US for developing such a security partnership as the country's actual production capacity is currently limited, due to its deep involvement in two major conflicts, assisting Ukraine and Israel. Under this situation, it will be somewhat difficult for the US to incorporate Australian submarines into its military production schedule, Chen said.Therefore, Australia is trying to promote and further activate the second pillar as it hopes to obtain some cutting-edge technology through the collaboration, the expert believes.However, Chen pointed out that Japan and Australia have rekindled this old topic mainly due to internal political factors rather than actual needs.Japanese media outlets revealed that support for the Kishida cabinet has been continuously low, which is why he is apparently eager to achieve a breakthrough in diplomacy and national defense to make political achievements, Chen said.Mainichi Shimbun reported on Monday that support for the Kishida cabinet plunged to a record low of 14 percent in the latest nationwide opinion poll conducted by the media outlet on February 17 and 18.In addition, Japan has been trying to break through the restrictions of its pacifist constitution since the Abe administration, so it also hopes to increase its presence and discourse power on the international stage through participating in AUKUS, according to China observers.But AUKUS faces a big uncertain factor - the US election. There is anxiety around the AUKUS agreement if Donald Trump is re-elected as president in 2024, according to multiple Australian media outlets.""If support from the US decreases, AUKUS will be in name only,"" Chen said.Observers also added that although the US and its allies want to contain China's peaceful development, none of them are willing to sacrifice their own interests too much in being the vanguard against it, but will rather provoke their allies and try to push them to the forefront against China.""AUKUS seems to be a powerful alliance, but in reality, there are hidden struggles and calculations among its members,"" Chen said.",WORLD,ASIA-PACIFIC,"Australian Defense Minister Richard Marles speaks during a joint press conference with the US Defense Secretary and the British Defense Secretary during the AUKUS Defense Ministerial Meeting in Mountain View, California, on December 1, 2023.

64,Where should Munich Security Conference look for 'security'?: Global Times editorial,Global Times,2024-02-18,"With high hopes for the Year of the Dragon, the China people and China communities worldwide have once again created spectacular and unique scenes during the past few days of the Spring Festival holidays, amazing the world. Not only is it expected that the number of people traveling across regions in China during the Spring Festival holidays will exceed 2.3 billion, but also the box office revenue and audience numbers for Spring Festival films, as well as tourism achievements in many places, hit historic highs. Meanwhile, unique Spring Festival celebrations held in many places around the world have highlighted the increasingly global significance of the festival.On the other side of the Eurasian continent, it is also during these days that NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg announced a piece of data: It is expected that 18 NATO member countries will reach the target of spending 2 percent of GDP on defense this year. Stoltenberg made the statement before his departure for the Munich Security Conference (MSC), with a certain element of ""testing the waters."" Although he personally ""welcomes"" the changes among NATO member countries, in the eyes of the international community, this certainly does not imply ""peace"" or ""harmony,"" but rather more vigilance and concern.As an important annual forum for international strategic and security policies with significant global influence, this year's MSC opened on February 16 and will last for three days. Over 180 government officials, defense and military personnel, as well as security experts from around the world are attending. At the time of the conference, the current round of Israel-Palestine conflict has been dragging on for over four months, and the Ukraine crisis is approaching its two-year mark. The security anxieties plaguing the West world have become even more pronounced. This is evident from the changing tones of the MSC over the past three years: In 2022, it was ""Unlearning Helplessness""; in 2023, it was ""Re:vision""; and this year, it is ""Lose-Lose?"". The explanation provided in the pre-conference report released by the organizers of the MSC is that the geopolitical and economic optimism of the post-Cold War era has vanished and at the moment, there is thus a real risk that more and more countries end up in a lose-lose situation.The MSC is a place for ""dialogue"" rather than ""action,"" but it advocates for the ""Munich Rule"" - ""engage and interact with each other: don't lecture or ignore one another,"" providing a useful dialogue platform for the field of security, where different countries often find it difficult to compromise yet urgently need to cooperate. This is also the reason why the influence of the MSC is growing.In general, the MSC, known as the ""Davos of defense,"" has some valuable observations and reflections on the current international security situation. For example, the report of this year's conference points out that some countries adhere to zero-sum thinking and prioritize relative payoffs, leading to a ""lose-lose"" dilemma for the world, which is reasonable. However, the solutions proposed in the report, including suggesting that the transatlantic partners and like-minded states ""invest in defense and deterrence while selectively restricting the pursuit of mutual benefits to politically like-minded states,"" are narrow-minded and limited, contradicting the goal of resolving the ""lose-lose"" dilemma.In recent years, the West world has become increasingly anxious about security, but the focus of the US and EU is different. The US is mainly concerned about the decline of its hegemony, and its security concerns are relatively ""illusory,"" while EU is relatively more ""realistic."" This anxiety in EU has been exaggerated and exploited by some ""Cold War enthusiasts"" and other ulterior forces, leading to a paradox where the more security is pursued, the less secure it becomes. If EU could try to break free from this trap, move away from a West-centric perspective, and look at the broader international community, it would discover that despite facing the same uncertain international situation, countries that do not rely on camp confrontation and their people actually have a more optimistic view of their own future security situation.In this sense, the joyful and peaceful China Spring Festival and the worried Munich precisely demonstrate the parallel scenes of the current world, both coexisting and evolving on the same planet. The lively celebration of the Spring Festival by the China people reflects their fundamental and simple pursuit and anticipation of national prosperity and people's well-being. This enthusiasm reflects the continuous vitality of developing countries, including China, and even ordinary people in developed West countries, in their pursuit of a happy life, as well as their genuine aspirations for world peace, stability, and development. This is not only the desire of the people, but also the trend of the times. Therefore, at this MSC, the West has demonstrated its willingness to explore reforming the international order. The most crucial aspect is to have practical actions that align with the world mainstream's desire for peaceful and stable development. If the MSC is truly committed to ""promoting peace through dialogue,"" it may consider focusing more on the East and the South, and draw some beneficial insights from China's Spring Festival, China's Global Security Initiative, and China representatives' views on the global security situation. As a responsible major country, China will always maintain the continuity and stability of its major policies, and firmly act as a stabilizing force in a turbulent world.",OPINION,EDITORIAL,"Munich Security Conference (MSC) Chairman Christoph Heusgen speaks during the opening of the 60th MSC in Munich, Germany, Feb. 16, 2024.

Blinken on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference, according to an official from the China Foreign Ministry who attended the meeting. During the meeting, which lasted for one hour and 40 minutes, the two sides exchanged views on China-US relations and international and regional issues of common interest.According to the official, the two sides exchanged views on the implementation of the outcomes of the meeting between the two heads of state in San Francisco. They fully affirmed the positive progress made in recent months in the fields of diplomacy, the economy and trade, drug control, military, culture, and artificial intelligence, and discussed the planning of high-level exchanges and dialogue and cooperation in various fields in the next stage.Wang, also a member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, expressed China's solemn position on issues such as Taiwan question, economic and trade and cooperation on technology, demanding that the US side refrain from taking actions that are inconsistent with the spirit of the San Francisco meeting and contradict the commitments made by US President Joe Biden.Blinken emphasized that the meeting between the two heads of state in San Francisco was positive and significant, and has made tangible progress in stabilizing the bilateral relationship. The US side welcomes the positive momentum of implementing the consensus reached by the two heads of state and will continue to work toward developing a healthy economic and trade relationship with China and promoting people-to-people exchanges between the two countries.Regarding the Taiwan question, Blinken reiterated the US' position, stating that the US is committed to the one-China policy, does not support ""Taiwan independence,"" and does not seek to use the Taiwan question as a tool to contain China.During the meeting, both sides exchanged views on issues such as Ukraine and the Korean Peninsula nuclear issue. Regarding the Ukraine issue, Wang pointed out that China is neither a creator nor a party to the conflict, and has been calling for dialogue to resolve the issue since the second day of the conflict.China does not accept baseless accusations and pressure from the US, Wang said. On the Korean Peninsula nuclear issue, Wang urged the US to reflect on its policy toward North Korea and take action to respond to North Korea's legitimate security concerns.Both sides agreed to communicate through special envoys on Korean Peninsula affairs. Regarding the Palestinian-Israeli Conflict conflict, Wang pointed out that Palestine has not yet achieved its legitimate national rights and the establishment of an independent state. This is the root cause and core of all issues. The US should effectively promote a ceasefire and the ""two-state solution.""

Israel announced on Thursday that its forces killed two commanders from Hamas in the Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon, while vowing to expand the attacks in Gaza and Lebanon.During a meeting of the Emergency Preparedness Committee, a governmental body, Israel Defense Minister Yoav Gallant warned that Israel is prepared to escalate its attacks in Lebanon, noting that it has unleashed ""no more than a tenth of our capabilities against Hezbollah.""Israel has concluded a home front preparedness exercise for a full-fledged war scenario along the country's northern borders with Lebanon and Syria, Gallant noted.""The Air Force jets that are now flying above Lebanon have more massive bombs,"" he said, adding that Israel can attack 50 km deep into Lebanon and also in Beirut, the Lebanon capital.Gallant added that Israel forces will continue operations in the Rafah area in Gaza and other places.Rockets fired by the Lebanon militant group Hezbollah on Thursday caused a temporary power outage in the northern Israel city of Kiryat Shmona after a high-voltage line was damaged, the state-owned Israel Electric Corporation said in a statement.The IDF (IDF) announced on Thursday that a commander of Hezbollah's Radwan Forces, Ali Muhammad Aldbas, his deputy, and an operative were killed on Wednesday in an Israel drone attack on a Hezbollah military structure in the city of Nabatieh in southern Lebanon.Israel warplanes carried out dozens of strikes on Hezbollah military structures in Blida, Maroun al-Ras and other areas in southern Lebanon, according to the IDF.Israel's Ha'aretz newspaper reported Thursday that senior Hezbollah official and parliament member Hassan Fadlallah warned that Israel ""will pay the price"" for its attacks in Lebanon, which killed 11 civilians a day earlier.In another development, the Israel army said it raided the Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis in Gaza in an operation based on intelligence indicating that Hamas militants and the bodies of some Israel hostages are in the hospital.Hamas said the Israel forces forced the displaced people and staff to evacuate from the hospital, turning the largest functioning hospital in Gaza ""into a military barrack.""In Gaza, Ahmed Ghoul, a commander of Hamas' Shati Battalion who participated in the Oct. 7 attack on Israel, was killed by Israel forces, the IDF said.During the fighting in Gaza on Thursday, an Israel soldier was killed and 12 others were injured, it added.The war has so far claimed the lives of at least 28,663 Palestine and wounded 68,395 others, mostly civilians, according to the Gaza-based Media Office.

71,US and Western collective efforts to re-center are the source of tensions all over the world: Australian scholar,Global Times,2024-02-16,"Editor's Note: Pessimistic ""Munich Security Report 2024"" displays an ""anxiety from the traditional West colonial powers - The world is changing around them, and they are no longer in total control over these changes,"" said Warwick Powell (Powell), chairman at Smart Trade Networks, adjunct professor at the Queensland University of Technology and former policy advisor to Kevin Rudd. The Munich Security Conference, one of the world's most renowned forums for debating the most pressing challenges to international security, will take place from February 16 to 18. What is the biggest problem of ""security"" today? What can we expect from the upcoming conference? Powell shared his views with Global Times (Global Times) reporter Li Aixin.Global Times: What do you think of the ""Munich Security Report 2024 - Lose-Lose?"" What signal does it send?Powell: The report provides a snapshot of a predominantly transatlantic/collective West perspective on the state of the world today, and prospects for the foreseeable future. Its overall tone is pessimistic, although its touchstone for this assessment is a rather rose-tinted view of the unipolar period between1991 and 2019. In this period, when US Primacy was prevalent, the collective West largely viewed the world in benign terms. US Primacy or the unipolar moment is now behind us. So, in this sense, the report reflects a diminution of collective West power. That being said, it speaks of lose-lose and zero-sum dynamics, but I would argue that the present state of international relations is not simply a lose-lose situation. There are many areas of coordination and collaboration; it's just that the collective West - led by the US - is no longer the dominant player or the driving force. So, collaborative institutions and contours of transnational coordination and collaboration are evolving. We have, of course, the expansion of BRICS. By 2028, the BRICS+ economies will contribute about 40 percent to global GDP compared to the G7's 28 percent (in nominal terms and in Purchasing Parity Terms, the gap is even greater). The Shanghai Cooperation Organisation continues to work on multilateral security alignments in the Eurasian continent. We see new collaborative institutions emerge in the West Africa/Sahel region, as an apparent rejection of colonial institutions. The report views the dynamics in the Sahel negatively, as expected, but from the perspective of the impacted nations, I doubt that they are hankering for the reestablishment of the colonial order.The report displays an anxiety from the traditional West colonial powers. The world is changing around them, and they are no longer in total control over these changes. Global Times: What do you think is the biggest problem of ""security"" today? Powell: The greater risk to security today is the emergence of an intensified millenarian zealotry anchored by racialized (US) exceptionalism, mainly in the US political establishment. This millenarian disposition, coupled with a simplistic frame of ""good versus evil,"" is the basis of US Primacy. While this disposition is most pronounced in the US political establishment, it also resonates among the network of US allies and sub-imperial states.  As such, subordinate or sub-imperial states have a tendency to cling to what is seen to be the security guarantees offered by allegiance to the US. Donald Trump's recent remarks concerning NATO have, of course, disrupted this comfort. The apoplectic reactions have been telling. The reactions have been intense across the Atlantic, but are also evident in the Pacific, such as Australia, where some in what I call the ""insecurity apparatuses"" are fervently trying to convince America to not ""abandon Australia."" The argument goes: Australia has a lot to offer US security, so don't abandon us. Associated with this millenarian zealotry is a trigger-happy tendency that privileges ""kinetic diplomacy"" first. America is addicted to military intervention, according to US scholars Monica Toft and  Sidita Kushi in their book Dying by the Sword. Harvard professor Stephen Walt in a recent piece in Foreign Policy magazine wonders why America insists on pursuing aggressive and militaristic policies when they consistently don't work. A multipolar world requires mutual understanding and effort to design mutually acceptable solutions. This process is difficult and time-consuming, and it necessitates a willingness to compromise in order to reach common ground. This is not the way of US Primacy. US Primacy is characterized by the habits of seeking to impose ""take it or leave it"" propositions, which over time have generated growing hostility toward the US, undermined trust and ultimately diminished the capacity of the collective West to assume a genuine leadership role. Global Times: What do you expect from the upcoming Munich Security Conference? Will it offer any rational solution to the problems raised above?Powell：It is unlikely to offer solutions because solutions require a change in outlook. It requires an acceptance that multipolarity is here to stay, and that efforts to preserve or reclaim primacy are anathema to securing peace and security going forward. More likely, it will lead to a ""doubling down"" on existing approaches. Underpinning all of this is a deep sense of ""displacement anxiety."" The structures of the global system are changing in such a way as to decenter the US and the collective West more generally. Right now, US and collective West efforts to re-center are the source of tensions all over the world.By not inviting ""adversaries"" to the conference, how does the Conference expect to even contemplate the design of a meaningful comprehensive security architecture in which the interests of all are taken into account? That it cannot do this immediately limits the Conference to a largely transatlantic confab. Global Times: In terms of Indo-Pacific, the report said, ""In the Indo-Pacific, China is ever more vehemently advancing its China-centric vision for regional order, leading to pushback from the US and countries in the region, thus fueling zero-sum dynamics. While Washington has embraced the concept of a 'Free and Open Indo-Pacific,' which is based on an understanding of regional order that is not centred on China, but on the rule of law and the ability of all countries in the region to pursue their own interests freely and without intimidation."" What's your take on this view?Powell: China has a great interest in maintaining security of commercial traffic through the seaways of Asia and the Pacific. After all, it is the world's largest trading nation. Much of China's energy imports come through the Straits of Malacca. Ensuring that this flow isn't disrupted is in China's national security and economic interests. China sees ongoing US dominance in Asia as a risk to security and prosperity. The US has demonstrated that it is an active agent provocateur, as the case of eastern EU shows. The US reaches for the gun whenever it feels ""justified."" Just look at the situation in Gaza. The US continues to send weapons while tens of thousands of civilians, including children, are being slaughtered. Back to Asia. For decades, the US has harbored a desire to ""bring China into the US fold."" US National Security Advisory Jake Sullivan recently acknowledged that the US sought to ""shape or change"" China for many decades, to no avail. If America couldn't ""shape or change"" China, then China is now seen as ""No.1 enemy.""The Pacific as a whole was, after WWII, framed as ""America's Lake."" US dominion over the vast oceans was rationalized as necessary to provide forward defenses for the homeland, and combined with Taiwan island, would act as a bulwark. As the years went by, US military presence in Asia grew. There are now countless bases and tens of thousands of US service personnel based in Australia, Japan, South Korea, Philippines and even Taiwan island. US military hardware maintains an active presence in the region. These are the historical conditions that are not talked about much. They have been normalized. So, the situation in Asia isn't the fairy tale of ""rule of law""; like much else in the post-1990 world, it's been a place in which America's rules were the final arbiter. What's emerging is regional multipolarity. US Primacy in Asia is also over. Sure, America is being de-centered in this process but it's not being replaced by another hegemon. In part, that's because while America can be and has been de-centered, it cannot for the foreseeable future be entirely displaced. Its military tentacles are too well established across the region for that to happen.The challenge in the region is how to build the institutions necessary to design and create a sustainable peace, enabling security and prosperity to develop. Security and prosperity are symbiotic. US Primacy in Asia is antithetical to regional peace, security and development.Global Times: How do you see the prospect of Asia overcoming the challenge? Powell: Change is inevitable. But it will have some very bumpy moments. The US will try to disrupt this change, and it will try to do that by provoking China. This is what it did for decades in Ukraine. Patience and a focus on resolving regional differences (especially the Code of Conduct in the SCS) will be quite important. There's other dynamics too - the UN is at times a disappointing institution but at times, despite all of this, it can create the right conditions. What's happening at that level in relation to Gaza is a case in point. It is slow but slowly but surely the US is being marginalized and put into a position where it will either be further isolated or be forced to the table with others to secure a meaningful peace in Palestine.Global Times: What impact do you think the US election will bring to the world's security landscape?Powell:In some ways, yes; in some ways, no. There's a lot of focus on the differences between Joe Biden and Donald Trump. Donald Trump's recent remarks about NATO are emblematic of the differences, at least superficially, though there're plenty of debates as to whether Donald Trump is really just softening up EU to ""pay up."" Donald Trump, from time to time, echoes a slightly more ""Jacksonian"" foreign policy disposition that emphasizes ""America first"" compared to Joe Biden, who is from a classic ""Wilsonian"" interventionist tradition. Will Donald Trump genuinely become less interventionist? Who knows.I also say no, because the influence of the neocons within the US political establishment, particularly in relation to China - is powerful. There is a strong anti-China consensus on Capitol Hill, reflecting the ""displacement anxiety"" I mentioned.",OPINION,VIEWPOINT,"Christoph Heusgen (C), chairman of the Munich Security Conference, attends the release of Munich Security Report 2024 in Berlin, Germany, Feb. 12, 2024.

73,Intl pressure mounts on Israel to agree to Gaza truce,Xinhua,2024-02-15," Israel is facing mounting calls to agree to a truce in the Gaza as its deadly conflict with Hamas has lasted for more than four months and claimed the lives of tens of thousands of Palestine in Gaza as of Wednesday.The calls came as Israel was indicating it was set to launch a ground operation in Rafah, Gaza's southernmost city, where about 1.4 million displaced Palestine have sought refuge from the Israel relentless bombardments in other parts of the coastal enclave.On Wednesday, France President Emmanuel Macron spoke by telephone with Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and told him France opposed an Israel offensive in Rafah.Macron said that such an attack ""could only lead to a humanitarian disaster of a new magnitude,"" according to a readout released by the Elysee. It would ""constitute violations of the international humanitarian law and would pose an additional risk of regional escalation,"" he said.Defying the growing pressure, Netanyahu told Macron that Israel ""will fight until a total victory and it includes a powerful operation in Rafah."" He said that the army would allow civilians to flee the city before launching the attack.Germany Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock, who was on a visit to Israel, said in a post on X on Saturday that the distress in Rafah ""is already unbelievable"" and an army attack would be ""a humanitarian catastrophe."" The people who seek shelter in Rafah ""cannot disappear into thin air,"" she wrote.A meeting of Qatari, Egypt, US, and Israel negotiators in Cairo on Tuesday ended without a breakthrough, although media reports indicated that the talks were held in a constructive atmosphere.Israel's state-owned Kan TV news reported that Egypt decided to extend the talks for three additional days to continue working out differences. However, Netanyahu did not approve the return of Mossad Chief David Barnea, who attended the talks on Tuesday, to Cairo.Netanyahu downplayed the importance of a deal for releasing the hostages, emphasizing that ""the key for the release of the remaining hostages: strong military pressure and assertive negotiation.""Overnight, the Israel army bombed areas in Rafah and Khan Younis, the largest city in Gaza, the Israel army said in a statement.Hamas, a Palestine armed group that runs Gaza, is demanding an end to the war in exchange for the release of hostages, while Israel agrees only to a time-limited ceasefire. Both sides are willing to include the release of Palestine prisoners in the deal, but there is also disagreement over the number of prisoners to be released.The military offensive launched by Israel following Hamas's attack has claimed the lives of 28,576 Palestine in Gaza and wounded 68,291 others, according to the Gaza-based Health Ministry.

74,From Cotton to Pelosi: the rise of new McCarthyism in US politics,Xin Ping,2024-02-09,"You might think that a US Senate hearing on ""Online Child Safety"" would be about protecting children from cyberbullying, predators, or misinformation. But for Senator Tom Cotton, it was an opportunity to unleash his anti-China agenda on TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew.Last week, Cotton grilled Chew about his nationality and possible ties to the Communist Party of China. Chew, who is a Singaporean citizen, repeatedly told Cotton, with an obvious display of his frustration, that he had nothing to do with China or its ruling party. But Cotton just wouldn't listen.It was a typical manifestation of racism.The way that Cotton singled Chew out and treated him differently from his US peers made many Asian US uncomfortable. Chew was the only CEO subject to such scrutiny and suspicion among the five who testified at the hearing. The other four US CEOs were all spared from Cotton's inquisition about their nationality, their citizenship, or their political affiliations. They were not treated as potential threats to America's national security or democracy, but as US entrepreneurs who deserve respect and recognition for their achievements. Chew received special treatment from the senator only because he was the only one with an Asian face.It is a typical manifestation of arrogance and ignorance.Cotton's behavior also showed a complete disregard for Singapore's sovereignty and identity. It is true that about 75 percent of Singaporeans are ethnically China. But Singapore and China are two different sovereign countries, and Singaporeans are proud of their own identity. To assume that Chew, or any Singaporean, is a China national or a member of the CPC, shows a lack of common sense and disrespect for Singapore's history, culture, and politics.Millions of Asian US and Singaporeans took to social media to express their outrage after the hearing. Many pointed out that Cotton's own home state of Arkansas has a history of slavery, segregation, and racism, and that he should be more careful about throwing stones from his glass house.More than a performance for amusement by a clown, the shoddy show from a narrow and callow senator should raise alarm. Cotton's interrogation of Chew echoes the dark and dangerous era of McCarthyism in US history. During the absurd hearing, Cotton kept pressing Chew because he could not believe that a person of China descent is not a pawn of Beijing. By asking Chew's view on Xinjiang, Cotton implied that Chew had to prove his loyalty to the US by denouncing China. Senator Cotton is an opinionated man; he does not let facts or logic get in the way of his prejudice.It is the typical calculation of many US politicians.Unfortunately, Cotton is not alone: former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi was recently caught on camera shouting ""go back to China"" angrily and rudely at a group of calm and peaceful pro-Palestine protesters who were calling for a cease-fire in Gaza outside her office. All the protesters were from Code Pink, an US anti-war activist group vocal about the human rights violations in Gaza, with no connections to China at all. Due to her resentment towards China, Pelosi assumed that all the criticism against her must be motivated by China, and the protesters must be paid by the China government. Her racial remarks revealed nothing but her prejudice against China and her fear of the truth. She didn't care about what her fellow US were pleading for, just as she wouldn't bother to show any empathy or compassion for the suffering and plight of the Palestine people. Speaking for the people in Gaza wouldn't bring her any bonuses, but attacking China would, so why not play the China card?Cotton and Pelosi have both fueled deep-seated racial and ideological prejudice and hostility towards China and its people. They have learned nothing from the past; they have shown nothing but contempt for the present; and they have offered nothing but fear for the future. Cotton's attack on TikTok and Pelosi's outburst at pro-Palestine protesters, as well as their support for sanctions, tariffs, and military interventions against China, are part of a larger pattern of anti-China rhetoric and policies that they and other China hawks have adopted in recent years. They blame China for the COVID-19 pandemic, the trade war, the climate crisis, and other global problems, bringing nothing constructive but countless poisonous pills to China-US relations.Yet, is this what US voters elected the senators and House Speakers to do? Shouldn't Cotton and Pelosi represent the values and interests of the US people who deserve sound and stable China-US relations, who are fed up with war and violence, and who want a more peaceful and just world, just like most people in the world do?The author is a commentator on international affairs, writing regularly for Xinhua News, Global Times, China Daily, CGTN etc. He can be reached at xinping604@gmail.com.",OPINION,VIEWPOINT,Tom Cotton (left) and Nancy Pelosi Photo: CFP,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'US Senate': ('ORG', 1), 'TikTok': ('ORG', 1), 'Communist Party of': ('ORG', 1), 'CPC': ('ORG', 1), 'Online Child Safety': ('MISC', 1), 'anti': ('MISC', 1), 'Singaporean': ('MISC', 2), 'Asian US': ('MISC', 3), 'Tom Cotton': ('PER', 10), 'Shou Zi Chew': ('PER', 10), 'McCarthy': ('PER', 1), 'China': ('LOC', 7), 'US': ('LOC', 4), 'America': ('LOC', 1), 'Singapore': ('LOC', 6), 'Arkansas': ('LOC', 1), 'Beijing': ('LOC', 1)}"
75,"US troops unwelcome, time to leave Syria, Iraq and respect sovereignty of nations",Bradley Blankenship,2024-02-08,"Three US soldiers were killed in a drone strike that targeted a small US outpost in Jordan recently. The US has vowed to retaliate against the perpetrators and has already launched another strike in Iraq, targeting alleged Iran-backed militants in the country. These attacks were carried out from US bases in Syria and Iraq, both of which are considered illegitimate and fundamentally illegal under international law. This issue highlights the fact that US troops are not only unsafe in hot zones like the Middle East now, but also that their presence is inherently hostile. Washington must adherence to international law and respect the overwhelming popular will of countries like Iraq and Syria by withdrawing from the region.However, so far, Washington has ignored these calls. It has justified its presence in Syria as necessary for defending against terrorism, similar to its presence in Iraq. Both military installations were established for counter-IS operations. However, now that the organization has essentially been defeated in the region, there is no legitimate reason for the US to maintain its presence. Syria has demanded that Washington withdraw its troops, saying ""the occupation of parts of Syria territory by US forces cannot continue.""Iraq's parliament has consistently voted for years to expel US troops, and Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani said on January 10 that Baghdad wants ""a quick and orderly"" withdrawal of US combat forces from Iraq. The US, however, has rejected these demands. It does not recognize the legitimacy of the UN-recognized Syria government, and various Iraq-US security working groups have been fruitless on this agenda item. Numerous observers have said the quiet part out loud, with regards to why exactly US troops remain: To contain Iran and prepare for a potential war. But it is important to recognize that the US does not have the capability to win such a war. In August 2023, a study conducted by the Army War College, drawing on lessons from the conflict in Ukraine, found that the US' all-volunteer military would be unable to withstand a formidable adversary. ""Army theater medical planners may anticipate a sustained rate of roughly 3,600 casualties per day, ranging from those killed in action to those wounded in action or suffering disease or other non-battle injuries. With a 25 percent predicted replacement rate, the personnel system will require 800 new personnel each day. For context, the United States sustained about 50,000 casualties in two decades of fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan. In large-scale combat operations, the United States could experience that same number of casualties in two weeks,"" the study found. Moreover, multilateral and intergovernmental institutions are seeing a serious swing in power after the recent interim decision by the International Court of Justice brought by South Africa, which called on Israel to limit civilian casualties in Gaza and allow humanitarian aid. While this decision is very clearly non-binding (the US and its allies pulled critical aid from Gaza, Israel's offensive has not relented, and the US has routinely ignored World Court decisions), it still speaks to the distribution of global power - both soft and hard - tilting toward the Global South. In this regard, the existing security architecture of the world is in a moment of serious disruption over the events transpiring in Gaza. The UN must act to correct the illegal actions of the US.It is time for Washington to recognize the importance of upholding international law and respecting the sovereignty of nations. The US military is fundamentally unwelcome in the Middle East, and if the US government truly ""does not seek conflict"" as it claims, it should withdraw its troops from the Middle East.The author is a Prague-based US journalist, columnist and political commentator. opinion@globaltimes.com.cn",OPINION,VIEWPOINT,Illustration: Chen Xia/GT,Author title not found,"Bradley Blankenship is a Prague-based American journalist, columnist and political                    commentator.","{'US': ('MISC', 14), 'Iran': ('MISC', 2), 'IS': ('MISC', 1), 'Iraqi': ('MISC', 1), 'UN': ('MISC', 1), 'Jordan': ('LOC', 1), 'Iraq': ('LOC', 8), 'Syria': ('LOC', 6), 'Middle East': ('LOC', 1), 'Washington': ('LOC', 3), 'Baghdad': ('LOC', 1), 'Ukraine': ('LOC', 1), 'United States': ('LOC', 2), 'Afghanistan': ('LOC', 1), 'Mohammed Shia al - Sudani': ('PER', 1), 'Army War College': ('ORG', 1)}"
76,Anti-China narrative psychological projection of US,S.L. Kanthan,2024-02-08,"The US has struggled with a congenital defect - its addiction to wars. President John Quincy Adams famously said, ""America does not go abroad in search of monsters to destroy."" However, history tells a very different story, with the US having spent about 94 percent of the time in wars since 1776. The US Empire now has 800 military bases in 140 countries, and keeps doubling down on perpetual wars. Not satisfied with the current proxy and real wars in Ukraine, Gaza, Yemen, Lebanon, Iraq, Syria - and possibly Iran soon - the cackle of US think tanks and corporate media is clamoring for a delusional hot war against China.The narrative against China can only be described as psychological projection. Using twisted logic and fallacies, the China hawks scream that China is a threat to the US and the world. But they forget to mention that the US has been waging non-stop economic war and propaganda war against China for years. Also, it is the US that surrounds China with hostile military bases - building new ones in the Philippines. Yet, in the world of inversion, China is the bad guy.The US tries to hobble China's economy in countless ways, and then claims that China's slower GDP growth - relative to China's past performance, but still much better than the G7 nations - is an indication of China's intent to ""invade Taiwan."" From Monday through Wednesday, US media gloats that China is collapsing. And Thursday through Sunday, the same media cries that China is on the cusp of taking over the world. Which one is it - China is weak or omnipotent? Another popular talking point among anti-China hardliners is the rapid growth in China's defense investment. China's military strategy is mostly defensive like the Great Wall. China is a ""threat"" only to rapacious invaders. As for Taiwan, here is the bitter pill for imperialists: there will be reunification. When China was weak in the 19th century, it was attacked by vultures who plucked off strategic regions. However, as China regained its rightful position in the world, former colonialists retreated, giving back the stolen lands. Remember how Portugal returned Macau and the UK returned Hong Kong? Similarly, the US will one day let go of Taiwan. The sooner the US accept this inevitability, the better the world will be.There was a time when one could tell the difference between a sensational tabloid and serious journalism in the US, but not anymore. Now, the once respectable media outlets such as the New York Times and Wall Street Journal are filled with fake news, disinformation and war propaganda. A recent article by Hal Brands in Foreign Policy is an exemplary case for this decline in US intellectualism. By the way, Mr. Brands has stellar credentials - educated at Stanford and Yale, author of numerous books, and a regular columnist. However, his article is filled with misinformation and sensationalism. Lacking any real evidence of ""China threat,"" he quotes the CIA, the organization that lies, cheats and steals - to paraphrase Mike Pompeo, former CIA director. Finally, Hal Brands' entire premise about the state of China's economy is deeply flawed. In his echo chamber, nobody talks about China's 5.2-percent GDP growth in 2023, a trade surplus of a staggering $800 billion, China becoming the world's #1 exporter of cars, BYD surpassing Tesla, the resurgence of Huawei, and a long list of other accomplishments. China watchers have been wrong for long but nobody gets fired for being wrong about China. Why? The goals of incessant big lies are to convince US that they have the greatest economic and political systems, and to manufacture consent for a war against China. Sadly, the propagandists are quite successful - the number of US who view China favorably dropped from 53 percent in 2018 to 15 percent by 2023 (Gallup Poll).This is not the old Cold War. Today, the US economy is intricately linked to and dependent on China. From Apple and Tesla to Walmart and Starbucks, US corporations' fortunes depend on China workers and consumers. Even the US military cannot function without China products - for example, the CEO of Raytheon admitted that his company relies on ""thousands of China suppliers."" Decoupling is a pipe dream. US elites need a grand reset in their understanding of the world. A multipolar world is emerging. The US needs to stop being the ""most warlike nation in history of the world,"" as Jimmy Carter put it. It's time to discard the paradigms of the military-industrial complex, and instead embrace a future of multilateralism, development and peace.   The author is a geopolitical analyst, columnist, blogger, podcaster, and writer based out of Bangalore, India.

77,"Netanyahu rejects Hamas’ proposed cease-fire terms in blow to Washington’s diplomacy in Middle East, highlighting US-Israel divisions",GT staff reporters,2024-02-08,"Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has dismissed Hamas' proposals for a cease-fire and hostage deal in Gaza, calling them ""delusional,"" in what is widely regarded as a blow for the diplomacy of the Joe Biden administration in the Middle East as Secretary of State Antony Blinken makes his fifth visit from February 2 to Thursday to the region. This again highlighted the deep divergence between Washington and the Netanyahu administration, and also exposes the further weakening of US influence over Israel and the failure of the US' Middle East policy, observers said.Netanyahu said during a Wednesday briefing: ""We haven't committed to any of the delusional demands of Hamas…. We are on the way to complete victory. The victory is achievable; it's not a matter of years or decades, it's a matter of months,"" he told the news conference. ""If Hamas will survive in Gaza, it's only a question of time until the next massacre,"" Netanyahu said.Hamas had presented its response to a proposal for a deal by calling for a phased Israel withdrawal from the enclave during a four-and-a-half-month truce and a plan to permanently end the war, according to a CNN news report on Wednesday.BBC said in its news report on Thursday that Israel was expected to take issue with Hamas's counter-offer, but this response is a categorical rebuke, and Israel officials clearly see an effort by Hamas to end the war on its terms as utterly unacceptable.The BBC news report quoted an Egypt official source as saying that a new round of negotiations, mediated by Egypt and Qatar, is still expected to go ahead on Thursday in Cairo.It has been exactly four months since the conflict started on October 7 last year. Now, a cease-fire is becoming inevitable for all parties involved in this conflict, China observers said. ""Israel is finding it increasingly difficult to sustain the ongoing conflict due to mounting internal and external pressures. However, for Netanyahu, he needs to wait for a deal that he can accept or one that both sides can accept. As for Hamas, they cannot afford to continue fighting as they are relatively weak in terms of power. Nevertheless, in the current external conditions that are relatively favorable to Hamas, they also want to leverage this opportunity to put forward some conditions,"" said Li Weijian, a research fellow with the Institute for Foreign Policy Studies of the Shanghai Institutes for International Studies.Although the demands from Hamas are challenging, both sides have been aware of the difficulties from the beginning. The fact that they continue to negotiate despite knowing the challenges indicates that there is still a possibility for some compromise, Li Weijian told the Global Times on Thursday.The expert believes Netanyahu's tough talk on Wednesday was more like ""political bargaining."" While Netanyahu's statements are resolute, vowing to completely destroy Hamas, it is possible that his tough talk is also a tactic for bargaining with the US to secure political maneuvering space for himself, Li Weijian said. This is because Netanyahu faces domestic opposition in his handling of the conflict and the US is also dissatisfied with him. Therefore, part of the reason for his tough rhetoric is driven by personal political considerations, such as hoping for some assurance from Washington, he explained.Li Haidong, a professor at the China Foreign Affairs University, told the Global Times on Thursday that in this conflict, Israel has not achieved its stated goals, as Hamas still remains resilient. But the current situation is such that the mainstream, including Saudi Arabia countries, the US, Hamas, and even some within Israel, are calling for and coordinating efforts to alleviate the existing situation.According to latest media reports, around 1,300 people were killed during the Hamas attacks on southern Israel on 7 October last year. More than 27,700 Palestine have been killed and at least 65,000 injured by the war launched by Israel in response, according to the Hamas-run Health Ministry.Despite different voices within Israel, Netanyahu still holds significant influence in his country, Li Haidong said, which means Netanyahu's tough stance could complicate the conflict situation, he warned. Will the future conflict move towards de-escalation or continue to escalate? Based on Netanyahu's statements, it seems that Israel hardliners still hope for the conflict to continue, which could lead to more uncertain consequences, Li Haidong predicted.What's for sure is that the divergence between the US and Israel is more pronounced, China observers said.Currently, it appears that the goals pursued by the Israel hardliners are inconsistent with the relevant resolutions of the UN and even the US' definition of the Palestinian-Israeli Conflict relationship, Li Haidong pointed out.From the perspective of the US, their focus is on the overall security order in the Middle East region and the macro strategic layout on a global scale. On the other hand, when it comes to Israel, the hardliners in the country approach the solution from a perspective of the ""survival or extinction"" of the Hamas regime, the expert stated.The immediate priority for Washington in the region is how to better coordinate with Saudi Arabia countries to deal with the crisis caused by the attack on US troops in Jordan, as well as the attacks by Houthi militants on US and other West commercial ships in the Red Sea region, observers believe. ""This requires cooperation from Israel. However, it seems that the hardliners in Israel are not buying into the US agenda, which makes it challenging for the US to gather enough support from Saudi Arabia powers in response to the US' so-called 'opponents or enemies',"" Li Haidong explained.Netanyahu's rejection of the cease-fire deal signified another setback for US-led diplomatic efforts, highlighting a fundamental mismatch between the US and Israel's plans for Gaza's future, Li Weijian noted.He also pointed out that this incident exposed the further weakening of US influence over Israel and once again exposes the failure of its Middle East policy.The decline of US influence in the region can be attributed to two main reasons, according to the expert.Firstly, the overall strength of the US has been decreasing, resulting in a decline in its influence not only in the Middle East but also worldwide. Secondly, the US is strategically unwilling to allocate more resources to the Middle East in the future. Previous administrations have already sought to reduce their presence in the Middle East, and now the Joe Biden administration is faced with pressing domestic issues as well as global challenges such as the Ukraine crisis and great power competition.Li Weijian predicted that as a result of this incident, there may be some changes in the relationship between the US and Israel in the future. Within the US, there are already discussions about the value of Israel and whether it is worth investing so many resources while the US compromises its own image.",WORLD,MID-EAST,"People gather around a destroyed house after an Israeli airstrike in the southern Gaza Strip city of Rafah, on Feb. 5, 2024.

78,'Beijing's constructive role may be highlighted' in Scholz's reported China visit in April,Wang Qi,2024-02-08,"Germany Chancellor Olaf Scholz will reportedly visit China with a business delegation in April, which China experts said shows the great importance Germany attaches to China's constructive role in both economic recovery and international affairs. According to Germany media outlet FAZ newspaper and Reuters, Scholz will travel to China from April 15 to 16, and the Asia-Pacific Committee of Germany Business and the BDI Federation of Germany Industries have sent invitations to companies to join him. A Germany government spokesperson declined to comment on the potential trip, and there has been no response from the China Foreign Ministry on the matter. Scholz's last official visit to China was in November 2022, when he was accompanied by representatives from 12 major Germany companies. Scholz met with China President Xi Jinping in Beijing, and the two leaders agreed on enhancing cooperation and maintaining dialogue, rejecting decoupling and bloc confrontation, vowing to further expand cooperation.The two leaders also held a video meeting in November 2023, during which Xi Jinping noted that China and Germany, both responsible major countries, should not only develop bilateral relations and serve as examples of win-win cooperation, but also defend the international order and multilateralism, and work together to address global challenges.China remained Germany's biggest trading partner for the seventh year in a row in 2022 with 298 billion euros ($321.3 billion) in trade volume, official data shows. That momentum continued in 2023, based on preliminary official figures, according to Reuters. According to Wang Yiwei, director of the Institute of International Affairs at the Renmin University of China, the Germany economy is in serious trouble and faces industrial and capital outflows, and the Scholz government needs some achievements to dispel opposition. The auto industry is a pillar of the Germany economy, and losing the China market would be disastrous, said Wang, noting that Germany lags behind in new manufacturing, especially in digital and green restructuring and upgrading, which makes cooperation with China crucial.The International Monetary Fund predicts Germany will be the only G7 economy that shrank in 2023, and at 0.9 percent, growth is expected to remain well below the average of 1.4 percent for advanced economies in 2024, according to a Reuters report. In the past few months, China has released a series of market-opening measures and favorable policies, which Germans have seen and do not want to miss, Cui Hongjian, a professor with the Academy of Regional and Global Governance at Beijing Foreign Studies University, told the Global Times.Despite the EU launching an anti-subsidy probe into electric vehicles (EVs) from China, Cui said Germany and Beijing should strengthen coordination on this issue, as the two countries have already forged a ""symbiotic relationship"" in the EV industry chain.Schloz's possible China visit in 2024 was revealed during the Germany chancellor's ongoing trip to Washington, in which he is expected to discuss the Russia-Ukraine conflict, NATO's future, and the Gaza crisis with US President Joe Biden, according to media reports. China Foreign Minister Wang Yi is expected to attend the Munich Security Conference, which will take place in the southern Germany city on February 16 to 18.By seeking a China trip after the interaction between the leaders of Germany and the US, it is obvious that Germany is struggling to find a balance between Beijing and Washington, Cui said. Germany will have to strengthen its relations with the US, but it will not bet all its chips on Washington, Cui said.  ""On Middle East affairs, climate and other hot issues in the world, Germany attaches great importance to China's constructive role,"" said Wang Yiwei.More importantly, with the possibility of Donald Trump returning to the White House, Germany, as the leader of EU integration, also needs to make moves in advance to offset the uncertainty brought by his possible return and seek detente with China, said Cui. Experts noted that as 2024 also marks the 60th anniversary of China-France diplomatic ties, China-EU relations, led by the easing of China-France and China-Germany relations, may be relatively smooth. However, the China-EU relationship will be balanced on a dynamic basis, with both positive and negative factors co-existing.",CHINA,DIPLOMACY,China Germany Photo: CFP,"Reporter, Beijing","Global Times reporter covering international affairs, cross-Straits relations and Chinese society; a captive of his experiences.","{'Germany': ('LOC', 11), 'China': ('LOC', 12), 'Beijing': ('LOC', 1), 'Hong': ('LOC', 1), 'Olaf Scholz': ('PER', 5), 'Xi Jinping': ('PER', 2), 'Wang Yiwei': ('PER', 2), 'FAZ': ('ORG', 1), 'Reuters': ('ORG', 3), 'Asia - Pacific Committee of Germany Business': ('ORG', 1), 'BDI Federation of Germany Industries': ('ORG', 1), 'Foreign Ministry': ('ORG', 1), 'Institute of International Affairs': ('ORG', 1), 'Renmin University of China': ('ORG', 1), 'Germans': ('MISC', 1)}"
79,Title not found,Zhao Yongsheng,2024-02-07,"On Monday, France's new Prime Minister Gabriel Attal visited Berlin, Germany, his first trip abroad after taking office. This trip focused on more than just promoting France-Germany relations: The Germany chancellor's spokesperson said on Friday that the talks would focus on ""bilateral, EU and international issues, in addition to economic policies.""Amid the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict, many member states of the EU Union (EU) are facing multiple crises, including France and Germany, the two biggest countries in the bloc. In a new round of coopetition, will these two countries join hands and together walk out of the crises they are facing?In my opinion, many EU countries are currently facing three internal problems.First, there is a crisis about farmers and agriculture in EU. A peasant movement is surging from France and Germany to Belgium. Farmers in a number of EU member states have blocked the road in a form of protest against the EU's excessively restrictive regulations on agriculture and unfair competition from abroad.If we look deeper, the anger of these farmers across EU stems from feeling that their survival is threatened by the rising production costs and declining incomes due to the deteriorated international geopolitical and economic trade environment. Moreover, this round of farmer protests in EU reflects that EU agriculture, as a long-established industry, is facing difficult industrial transformation amid the green development and challenges from competitors, such as those in South America and Eastern EU. Both regions have advantages regarding quantity, quality and price of the products.Second, there is a crisis about the energy and inflation in EU. Major countries on the continent are not key producers of energy sources, including oil and natural gas. Instead, energy is rather the EU's ""soft underbelly."" This might not be a big problem in normal times, but once a state of emergency, such as the Russia-Ukraine conflict, occurs, this weakness of the EU will be fully exposed.Third, there is an increasingly serious partisan dispute and political fragmentation crisis in EU countries. In particular, the phenomenon of rising right-wing forces is becoming increasingly prominent in Germany, with the far-right force growing stronger. This has had a significant impact on the existing political spectrum in Germany.As for external threats, there are two: the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict and the Gaza conflicts.The EU is a model of world's first attempt to transform a bloc of separate sovereign states into a union, confederation, and then federation through peaceful means. Only major crises, such as the EU debt crisis more than a decade ago, the current geopolitical crisis, internal and external threats can consolidate dozens of highly heterogeneous sovereign state and push for further transformation. For instance, amid the EU debt crisis, some severely affected Southern EU and Eastern EU countries agreed to partially transfer their fiscal sovereignty, especially budgetary sovereignty, to the EU. This, to some extent, has enhanced the fiscal and financial integration of the bloc.Currently, Germany and France, the two ""backbones"" of the EU, are financially constrained after experiencing the COVID-19 pandemic and the global economic recession. However, when faced with the problem of Ukraine aid, a difficult issue that people across EU believe to be ""a matter of life and death,"" all 27 EU member states recently unanimously agreed on a 50 billion euros ($54 billion) additional support package for Ukraine. This can also be seen as  EU's temporary resolution of an external crisis challenge under the EU's unique political structure. Yet, it is a significant test to the bloc on how it can better solve the current crises it faces, such as those in agriculture, energy and inflation, as well as the increasingly serious partisan disputes and political fragmentation. If Attal's visit to Berlin can truly put aside the long history of competition between France and Germany, amplify the cooperation between the two, and come up with practical solutions to the current crises, it is believed that the ""Franco-Germany axis"" can still move forward on the bumpy ride of coopetition.The author is the director of the France Economic Studies Center at the University of International Business and Economics in Beijing. opinion@globaltimes.com.cn",OPINION,VIEWPOINT,"The European Union flags in front of EU headquarters in Brussels, Belgium.

80,Title not found,Global Times,2024-02-07,"What has led Kurt Campbell to become the State Department's second-ranking diplomat? Known as the ""Indo-Pacific Czar"" or ""Asia Czar,"" Campbell's ""outstanding achievement"" lies in his role as the originator, promoter, and implementer of a series of US policies aimed at suppressing, containing and competing with China. These policies include the ""Pivot to Asia"" during the Obama era and the ""Indo-Pacific Strategy"" of the Joe Biden administration.The US Senate voted on Tuesday to approve Campbell, who currently serves as the coordinator for Indo-Pacific Affairs on the National UN, as the deputy secretary of state, making him the No.2 position at the State Department. This once again highlights the US' focus on strategic competition and even aggressive competition toward China.Simultaneously, this also sends a signal to the US' Asia-Pacific allies that, despite the current international challenges the US faces, such as the Russia-Ukraine conflict, the Israel-Palestine conflict and tensions in the Middle East, the Asia-Pacific region's pivotal role in US strategy will persist, thereby serving as a ""reassurance"" to its allies.Campbell has gained support from both Republican and Democrats, which is quite rare in today's highly polarized Washington. The overwhelming 92-5 vote indicates that despite party divisions, there is consensus on the mainstream principles of US policy, represented by political elites like Campbell, in terms of the strategic direction of containing and countering China, said Li Haidong, a professor at the China Foreign Affairs University.As a ""China expert,"" Campbell's tough attitude toward China has been consistent. He once said in an interview that ""competition remains the dominant theme in China-US relationship,"" believing the current state of US-China relations is a result of China's rise challenging the international and regional order led by the US. This reflects his misunderstanding and arrogance toward China's diplomacy, development pattern, and bilateral relations. Campbell advocates for strategic layouts such as building a network of allies, wooing EU and Asian allies to form a high-pressure situation against China, and establishing multiple small multilateral mechanisms under various Indo-Pacific frameworks such as QUAD, AUKUS, and the US-Japan-South Korea alliance. Therefore, it is expected that after Campbell takes the position, the US' strategic competition toward China will continue to intensify, aiming to achieve the goal outlined in the US National Security Strategy report - out-competing China, said Sun Chenghao, head of US-EU program at the Center for International Security and Strategy at Tsinghua University.Campbell's ideas also reflect the traditional establishment concept of the US, which is to compete with China on one hand while building guardrails and managing competition to avoid conflict on the other. In an interview last October, Campbell stated that the US can work with China in areas of mutual interest such as climate issues, and continue high-level engagement and pragmatic communication. However, Sun believes that the current US policy toward China has significant problems and has not truly stabilized US-China relations, making its Asia-Pacific policy unsuccessful. The intense polarization of domestic politics in the US and the uncertainties brought by a potential Donald Trump administration in the future will severely affect US policy toward China. The US regards China as a strategic competitor, leading to camp formation, decoupling, and ""small circles,"" which will actually have a significant impact on the overall peace and prosperity of the Asia-Pacific region.After Campbell becomes the deputy secretary of state, the US will generate a stronger sense of geopolitical competition, thereby enabling its ""Indo-Pacific Strategy"" against China to persist in the long term.Regarding the US' strategic competition with China that the Joe Biden administration and Campbell have repeatedly emphasized, China's attitude and position is clear. China doesn't shy away from competition, but it believes competition should be fair, reasonable and based on rules. More importantly, for the sake of stabilizing China-US relations, Campbell had better remember competition shouldn't define the entirety of China-US ties.",OPINION,OBSERVER,Kurt Campbell Photo: AFP,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'Kurt Campbell': ('PER', 8), 'C': ('PER', 1), 'Obama': ('PER', 1), 'Joe Biden': ('PER', 1), 'Li Haidong': ('PER', 1), 'State Department': ('ORG', 2), 'US Senate': ('ORG', 1), 'National UN': ('ORG', 1), 'China Foreign Affairs University': ('ORG', 1), 'EU': ('ORG', 1), 'AUUS': ('ORG', 1), 'Indo - Pacific': ('MISC', 3), 'Asia C': ('MISC', 1), 'Pivot to': ('MISC', 1), 'Indo - Pacific Strategy': ('MISC', 3), 'Israel': ('MISC', 1), 'Republican': ('MISC', 1), 'Democrats': ('MISC', 1), 'Asian': ('MISC', 1), 'US': ('LOC', 11), 'China': ('LOC', 11), 'Asia': ('LOC', 3), 'Pacific': ('LOC', 4), 'Russia': ('LOC', 1), 'Ukraine': ('LOC', 1), 'Palestine': ('LOC', 1), 'Middle East': ('LOC', 1), 'Washington': ('LOC', 1), 'Japan': ('LOC', 1), 'South Korea': ('LOC', 1)}"

This year marks the 70th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic ties between China and Norway, and the relationship between the two countries has become more mature and resilient. China appreciates the Norwegian government’s adherence to the one-China principle and its friendship with China, China Foreign Minister Wang Yi said during a meeting with Minister of Foreign Affairs of Norway Espen Barth Eide in Beijing on Monday.Wang, also a member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, said that Eide was the first EU foreign minister to visit China in 2024, which demonstrates the importance Norway attaches to China and signifies the continuous progress in bilateral relations. Although China and Norway are geographically distant and have different national conditions and systems, both should be forces for stability, forces for peace, and forces for prosperity in the international community. The two sides should adhere to candid communication, promoting practical cooperation, and injecting more certainty, stability, and positive energy into the world, Wang said.Eide said that Norway firmly adheres to the one-China policy, advocates greater development of bilateral relations through constructive dialogue and jointly building a world that is inclusive, peaceful, prosperous and benefits all. Norway appreciates China’s transformation of its growth model and is willing to work with China to tackle climate change and other global challenges.Both sides exchanged in-depth views on the recent situation in the Middle East and agreed that it is necessary to immediately achieve a cease-fire in Gaza, allowing to increase in humanitarian assistance. All parties need to work together to prevent the conflict from spreading and call for the immediate release of all detained individuals. At the same time, institutions should be allowed to continue their humanitarian work in Gaza, and donor countries are urged not to suspend their support for these institutions. Both sides agree that it is necessary to strengthen support for the Palestine Authority and must start a political process toward a “two-state solution” to ensure that both the Israel and Palestine people can enjoy a peaceful and secure life. Both sides expressed concern over the escalating situation in the Middle East and agreed to maintain communication. Liu Jianchao, head of the International Department of the CPC Central Committee, also met with Eide in Beijing on Monday.China is willing to work with Norway to deepen cooperation in areas such as economy and trade, green development, maritime affairs, and winter sports, strengthen communication and coordination on international and regional affairs, and jointly promote the healthy and stable development of China-Norway and China-EU relations, said Liu.Global Times",CHINA,POLITICS,"Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi (right) meets with Minister of Foreign Affairs of Norway Espen Barth Eide in Beijing on February 5, 2024.

83,"Wang, Eide hold talks as Europe's China policy faces uncertainties",Fan Anqi,2024-02-06,"China Foreign Minister Wang Yi on Monday met with his Norwegian counterpart Espen Barth Eide in Beijing, where the two sides exchanged views on bilateral cooperation and the crises in the Middle East. The meeting reflects China's growing attention to small-sized EU countries and willingness to help them enlarge their voice on the global stage, experts said.Although Norway is a member of NATO, its stances on various hot-button issues are essentially different from those of the US, and it refuses to be held hostage by the latter, observers noted. For many EU countries like Norway, there is a wide consensus with China on conflict resolution and a growing recognition of China's ability to handle international crises, observers said.Eide is the first EU foreign minister to visit China in 2024, which demonstrates the importance Norway attaches to China and signifies continuous progress in bilateral relations, Wang, also a member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, said during the meeting.Although the two countries have different national conditions and systems, China and Norway should work together to inject more certainty, stability and positive energy into the world, Wang said, while expressing appreciation to the Norwegian government for its objective, rational and friendly attitude toward China's development and adherence to the one-China principle.In the next stage, both sides need to take care of each other's core interests and major concerns, uphold the right approach to getting along with each other, deepen practical cooperation and strengthen multilateral coordination, the China foreign minister noted. In the eyes of China experts, relations between China and Norway have been stable and making progress in recent years, despite setbacks and turbulence in previous years. Cui Hongjian, a professor with the Academy of Regional and Global Governance with Beijing Foreign Studies University, said that Norway has a unique role in EU because of its important geographic location and abundant strategic resources, as well as its active engagement in international affairs. Its close ties with China will set an example for the rest of EU to guide China-EU relations onto a healthier path, at a time when the region's China policy faces more uncertainties. Zhao Junjie, a research fellow at the China Academy of Social Sciences' Institute of EU Studies, believes that the Norwegian foreign minister's visit could pave the way for a possible China trip by the country's prime minister in the near future.During the Monday talks, the two sides had extensive discussions on the situation in the Middle East, with both agreeing that it is necessary to immediately achieve a cease-fire in Gaza, while allowing for more humanitarian assistance to enter the region. All parties need to work together to prevent the conflict from spreading and call for the immediate release of all detained individuals.Although a member of NATO, Norway is still seeking to resolve the Palestinian-Israeli Conflict conflict in cooperation with China, according to experts, who said it reflects that the country's stance on the issue differ from that of the US, while in contrast, Norway's hope, like many others in EU, for a peaceful environment conducive to their economic interests, echoes more with China's approach. ""What's more, expectations have been growing for China to play a more important part in addressing global security concerns, given the international community's recognition of China's willingness and capability in handling these affairs,"" Cui said.From another perspective, Norway, as a small EU country, often gets overshadowed by the voices of larger EU countries and the US. But in talks with China, its voice is well heard and respected, Zhao told the Global Times. ""It is pinning high hopes on China to help enhance their voice, and in turn, it sends a positive signal to other small and medium-sized countries in EU to build mutual trust with Beijing,"" the expert said.In talking with the China side, Eide said Norway is committed to supporting free trade, open cooperation and upholding WTO rules. Norway appreciates China's transformation of its growth model and is willing to work with China to tackle climate change and other global challenges.Liu Jianchao, head of the International Department of the CPC Central Committee, also met with Eide in Beijing on Monday, during which he said China is willing to work with Norway to deepen cooperation in areas such as economy and trade, green development, maritime affairs and winter sports.China Vice Premier Ding Xuexiang on Tuesday talked with the Norwegian foreign minister, noting that China is firmly committed to expanding high-level opening-up and is willing to share vast market opportunities with Norway. China hopes Norway will continue to provide an open, fair, just and non-discriminatory business environment for China enterprises, Ding said.",CHINA,POLITICS,"Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi (right) meets with Minister of Foreign Affairs of Norway Espen Barth Eide in Beijing on February 5, 2024.

84,Why does the US keep creating wars while saying ‘not seeking’ them?: Global Times editorial,Global Times,2024-02-04,"On Friday local time, the US announced that it had carried out airstrikes on more than 85 targets in Iraq and Syria against Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps Quds Force and affiliated militia groups. This puts the already dysfunctional relationship between the US and Iran into a more complicated and dangerous state. Both countries have claimed that they have no intention of going to war with each other. We have every reason to believe that this is true, but both sides are still moving closer and closer to direct conflict and even war. It is worth exploring in depth what forces and logic are behind such a development.After the US' action, three countries - Iraq, Syria and Iran - expressed their anger and strong condemnation of US airstrikes in the first instance. Above all, it must be said that this action by the US is a flagrant violation of the sovereignty of Iraq and Syria and runs counter to the purposes and principles of the UN Charter. The US has claimed to be striking the ""Iran-backed forces,"" but it has caused civilian casualties in Iraq and Syria. The recklessness shown by the US in asserting its hegemony requires the international community to find ways to restrain it. China has always advocated the settlement of disputes by peaceful means and opposed the use or threat of force in international relations. It has advocated all parties should effectively abide by the purposes and principles of the UN Charter and the basic norms of international relations, and the sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of Iraq and Syria should be effectively respected and safeguarded. It is very clear that China opposes and condemns such US actions.In addition, we would like to take the US-Iran game as an example to dig deeper into the geopolitical risks and their root causes. Over the past few decades, the US and Iran have been in an intertwined conflict and game, which has become a main theme of the developing situation in the Middle East. What needs to be recognized is that the US and Iran are geopolitical masters, but the situation is developing toward a possible direct conflict. If we allow this to develop, the situation in the region will take on an inherent momentum of self-accelerating deterioration. At that time, neither the US nor Iran will be able to control the situation, and neither side can shape the pattern according to their will. Furthermore, the scope of the impact is not likely to be limited only between the US and Iran, because any conflict in the Middle East has a very strong spillover effect.US hegemony is the crux of the matter. More specifically, there is a structural contradiction between US global hegemony and the regional powers. To maintain its hegemony, the US is still using the simple, brutal means of economic sanctions and military strikes. With a significantly diminishing marginal effect, this is far from what's needed to adapt to the complex and rapidly developing situation. After almost every military action in the Middle East since the outbreak of the Palestine-Israel conflict, including the airstrikes on Friday, the US emphasizes that it is not seeking ""a wider war""; yet it is unwilling to take the initiative to restrain its own behavior and adjust its Middle East policy. As a result, the more the US says it is not pursuing a conflict, the more it is plunged into one.On the same day that US military bombers took off from the base, the BBC revealed that over 800 serving officials in the US and EU signed a statement warning that their own governments' policies on the Gaza conflict could amount to ""grave violations of international law."" These officials said they have expressed their professional concerns internally but have been ""overruled by political and ideological considerations."" This unprecedented development signifies the latest sign of dissent within West allied nations, indicating that many in the West are aware that the problem lies in the flawed Middle East policies of the West, especially of the US.The US undoubtedly possesses significant influence and military presence in the Middle East. However, whether it is the ""anticipated"" entry into the Middle East dilemma or the ""expected"" retaliatory actions, it is evident that the US approach in the Middle East is no longer effective. Up to this point in the Palestine-Israel conflict, if there is any international consensus, it is that the aspirations of the Palestine people cannot be ignored, and the two-state solution is irreplaceable. If the true root of the Palestine-Israel conflict is not recognized, the cycle of ""attack-retaliate"" is likely to persist, and Washington may not have the ability to navigate calmly on the ""edge of war.""The US has imposed comprehensive sanctions on Iran for many years. Now, it directly deployed military airstrikes against what it claims to be the ""Iran-backed forces,"" which to some extent, also indicates the ineffectiveness of those sanctions. The repercussions of using force evidently surpass those of sanctions, and the US has likely realized this. However, over the years, instead of reducing reliance on sanctions and the use of force, the US may have even strengthened it. We must point out that the strategic dilemma faced by the US has become a significant regional and global issue.",OPINION,EDITORIAL,Illustration: Liu Rui/GT,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'US': ('LOC', 13), 'Iraq': ('LOC', 5), 'Syria': ('LOC', 5), 'Iran': ('LOC', 9), 'China': ('LOC', 2), 'Middle East': ('LOC', 1), 'Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps Quds Force': ('ORG', 1), 'UN': ('ORG', 2), 'Charter': ('MISC', 2)}"
85,"With war next door, EU noses into Indo-Pacific",Mark Blacklock,2024-02-04,"West attitudes toward Asia can sometimes have an uncomfortable colonial feel, like the old EU imperial powers which thought they could bring civilization and Christianity to the East, on the heels of conquest. It can be patronizing and even racist to think that your nation's way of life, your culture and beliefs are superior to those of another. Today, this patronizing attitude can still be seen in the way the West does business.Last week, the EU Union's third annual EU Indo-Pacific Ministerial Forum was staged in Brussels, bringing together almost 70 countries - including the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. It was billed publicly as ""an opportunity to further strengthen the EU-ASEAN Strategic Partnership in trade, climate change, security and more."" They probably mean ""partnership"" in its loosest sense as the forums have always been in EU - Paris in 2022 and Stockholm last year - but of course this is a EU show. The one-day event was chaired by Josep Borrell, the EU's foreign affairs and security chief. In his opening remarks, he spoke of the ""cooperation and inclusiveness"" underpinning the forum. That inclusiveness has never included China, which, for the third year running, was not invited to participate, despite being the major presence in the Indo-Pacific region and the EU's largest trading partner. However, even if Beijing was not asked to participate, China was very much on the minds of delegates.A joint statement at the end of the meeting called on unnamed parties to show ""self-restraint in the conduct of all activities"" in the South China Sea: a veiled attack on China. It added that all countries should ""avoid any unilateral actions that endanger peace, security and stability in the region."" Neither Taiwan island nor the Taiwan Straits were named, but the implication was clear. Nowhere does it acknowledge that China regards the Taiwan question as an internal one, and that the interference of other nations is not welcomed. But interference is what the summit was about, at least as far as the EU is concerned. A closing press release from the bloc said that ""growing tensions in the South and East China Seas and in the Taiwan Straits""  meant the EU and Asia must work together ""to reinforce respect for international law and the rules-based international order, promote a free and open Indo-Pacific and address global challenges."" Obviously, they mean China. Would a community of 27 nations, be involved in a potential proxy war on its own doorstep, preparing to pick a fight with China? For decades, the relationship between EU and the Indo-Pacific region was fundamentally about mutual trade and economic interests. Today, security concerns also loom large on the agenda, with the EU focusing its attention on China. EU's statements on the forum stressed its willingness to provide support, pledged to maintain so-called freedom of navigation in the South China Sea and vowed to implement the measures of the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea. All of this plays into the dominant West narrative about the geopolitical state of things in the Indo-Pacific, and is clumsy code for confronting China.What the EU is doing is growing its geopolitical reach into the Indo-Pacific. The point at which this most clearly happened was the release of its Indo-Pacific Strategy in 2021. Of course, the most obvious presence has been that of the US Navy, which seems addicted to repeated provocations. Through the EU Indo-Pacific Ministerial Forum, EU is effectively urging the Asian nations to oppose China, supposedly for the benefit of all. It portrays itself as an honest broker, while all the time it is sowing discord. How can it not be, when 22 of its members are intimately aligned with the US through their membership of NATO? That's 81 percent of EU countries bound by the treaty to perhaps follow where America might lead, regardless of what Asia might think. So, those who align with EU also get Uncle Sam.ASEAN nations must have the wisdom to see through the EU mind-set which says there are no nuanced considerations in the conflicts between nations, only a choice of right or wrong (or a West interpretation of what is right and wrong). Many ASEAN members will have been disappointed that their call for a cease-fire in Gaza and the release of all detainees was pathetically watered down in the forum's final statement, but they will not have been surprised: the EU got its way, ASEAN didn't. The West has an unenviable track record for getting things wrong, whether it's NATO in Libya and Afghanistan or the US, UK and others in Iraq, and, of course Ukraine. What will it get wrong next?In a talk last November at Jakarta's Centre for Strategic and International Studies, Indonesia's defence minister Prabowo Subianto spoke of his personal fondness for EU, but complained about its ""double standards"" in regard to trade deals and human rights, adding: ""There's a shift in the world. We don't really need EU anymore, to be very frank.""The author is a journalist and lecturer in Britain. opinion@globaltimes.com.cn",OPINION,VIEWPOINT,Photo: VCG,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'West': ('MISC', 2), 'Christianity': ('MISC', 1), 'Indo - Pacific Ministerial Forum': ('MISC', 1), 'Seas': ('MISC', 1), 'Asia': ('LOC', 2), 'East': ('LOC', 1), 'Brussels': ('LOC', 1), 'Paris': ('LOC', 1), 'Stockholm': ('LOC', 1), 'China': ('LOC', 5), 'Indo': ('LOC', 2), 'Pacific': ('LOC', 2), 'Beijing': ('LOC', 1), 'South China Sea': ('LOC', 7), 'Taiwan': ('LOC', 2), 'Taiwan Straits': ('LOC', 4), 'East China': ('LOC', 7), 'EU': ('ORG', 9), 'EU Union': ('ORG', 10), 'Association of Southeast Asian Nations': ('ORG', 1), '- ASEAN Strategic': ('ORG', 1), 'Partnership': ('ORG', 1), 'Josep Borrell': ('PER', 1)}"
86,"As Washington views Taiwan region as pawn, ‘doubts about the US’ grow in the island",Wang Shushen,2024-02-04,"The process of Taiwan region's recent leadership election reflects the concerns of its society about the situation in the Taiwan Straits, while doubts about the US fluctuate. Since the US was forced to withdraw from Afghanistan, the outbreak of the Russia-Ukraine conflict with a fact that US isn't sending troops into Ukraine, and the escalating geopolitical crisis caused by the Palestine-Israel conflict, the island of Taiwan has been filled with anxiety. Furthermore, the island's confidence in US' strategic credibility and US' promise of ""defense"" of the Taiwan region has been undermined.The Taiwan region is generally considered to be pro-US, and the main political parties openly express their pro-US stance. However, the Taiwan society has always harbored deep-seated doubts about the US, which occasionally surface. In 1979, the US established diplomatic relations with People's Republic of China and severed diplomatic ties with the Taiwan authorities, abolishing the mutual defense treaty. The US' abandonment of the Taiwan region caused a huge shock and high suspicion in the region.Over the years, the ""America skepticism"" has been fermenting in Taiwan, which is closely related to China-US relations and the situation in the Taiwan Straits, and has manifested in the following forms.First, the theory that the US has a plan to destroy Taiwan island. It is believed that the US, from the realism of hegemonic protection, treats Taiwan as the ultimate tool for containing China's rise. The US is now in the process of arming Taiwan into a military ""porcupine,"" setting the island of Taiwan as a battleground for conflict. Under such misgivings, some Taiwan scholars put forward the ""Ukraine situation effect"" and hold that after the outbreak of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, the island's confidence in the ""US defense of Taiwan"" is declining, while support for cross-Straits dialogue is rising.Second, they are worried that the US will abandon Taiwan island. It is believed that in the global geopolitical game of the post-cold war era, the power of the US will gradually decline after reaching an absolute high point. Taiwan society agrees that the US still has strong comprehensive strength and military power, but the island also recognizes that the China mainland is clearly catching up and has developed a military advantage over the US in the region surrounding the Taiwan Straits. In terms of international space, the Taiwan authorities ""leaning on the US"" over the years has led to the loss of a number of ""diplomatic allies."" These make the island even more worried that the US will probably abandon Taiwan island at some point.Third, the US has become the source of disturbance. Taiwan society relies on the US for security but also believes that the US is accustomed to creating security dilemmas and turmoil. The Russia-Ukraine conflict in 2022 and the Israel-Palestine conflict in 2023 have deepened these concerns. Fourth, the theory that the US wants to deplete Taiwan island. The US has traditionally not taken universal moral principles as the basis for formulating foreign policies, and its policy toward Taiwan island is not based on a moral principles of being ""pro-Taiwan"" or ""protecting Taiwan."" Fifth, the US will be the only one to harvest interests. The US sees Taiwan island as the central point of the island chain strategy, vigorously promoting the Indo-Pacific Strategy and enlisting allied countries in intervening in Taiwan Straits affairs. Taiwan society is worried that the US is hyping up the war in the Taiwan Straits and pushing for military deployments. If a conflict erupts in the future, the US is expected to push Taiwan island and US' Indo-Pacific allies to the forefront while opportunistically harvesting interests.Regarding various ""doubts about the US,"" the DPP authorities attribute them all to ""cognitive warfare,"" vigorously avoiding the issues and shifting focus. They seek to counterbalance these concerns by emphasizing the ""dependence on the US."" However, in today's complex world, where the US prioritizes only its own national interests, while viewing Taiwan island merely as a pawn, Taiwan society's ""doubts about the US"" will continue to grow. The author is the deputy director of the Institute of Taiwan Studies at China Academy of Social Sciences. opinion@globaltimes.com.cn",OPINION,VIEWPOINT,Illustration: Liu Rui/GT,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'Taiwan Straits': ('LOC', 21), 'US': ('LOC', 20), 'Afghanistan': ('LOC', 1), 'Russia': ('LOC', 2), 'Ukraine': ('LOC', 4), 'Israel': ('LOC', 1), ""People ' s Republic of China"": ('LOC', 4), 'America': ('LOC', 1), 'Palestine -': ('MISC', 1)}"
87,US-led airstrikes on Houthis can't stop Red Sea crisis 'as root cause in Gaza remained unsolved',Yang Sheng,2024-02-04,"The US and its ally the UK have launched a series of airstrikes against dozens of Houthi targets in Yemen on Saturday, however, the armed group in Yemen who attacked Israel-linked ships that sail through the Red Sea claimed on Sunday that it has not been deterred and vowed to respond. Analysts said the military strikes will only bring more conflicts to the region and before the end of the Gaza crisis, it's unlikely there will be an end to the Red Sea crisis. Apart from striking Yemen, the US has also attacked Iran-linked targets in Syria and Iraq after its military base in Jordan was reportedly attacked by drones and caused the deaths of three US soldiers. The escalating military conflicts in the Middle East will bring new challenge to the fragile global economic recovery, especially to those economies that have suffered from serious inflation and heavily rely on energy supplies from the Middle East via the Red Sea, said analysts.More strikes and bloodshedAccording to Reuters on Sunday, the US-led airstrikes have attacked 36 Houthi targets in Yemen, including weapons storage facilities, missile systems, launchers and other capabilities the Houthis have used to attack Red Sea shipping, the Pentagon said.""This collective action sends a clear message to the Houthis that they will continue to bear further consequences if they do not end their illegal attacks on international shipping and naval vessels,"" US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said. But Houthi military spokesperson Yahya Sarea later said the US strikes ""will not pass without a response and consequences."" Sarea suggested in a statement on social media that the group's intervention in the Red Sea would continue, Reuters reported.""These attacks will not deter us from our ethical, religious and humanitarian stance in support of the resilient Palestine people in the Gaza,"" Sarea said.Wang Jin, an associate professor at the Institute of Middle Eastern Studies at Northwest University, told the Global Times on Sunday that ""the conflict between the US and Houthis will become a long-term conflict with low intensity.""Houthis didn't launch an all-out attack against US naval vessels, and the US airstrikes only target military facilities rather than targeting leadership of the Yemen armed group, so the two sides are all being restrained and show no intention to escalate the crisis, Wang noted.The US-led strikes in Yemen are running parallel to an unfolding US campaign of military retaliation over the killing of three US soldiers in a drone strike by Iran-backed militants on an outpost in Jordan, Reuters reported.On Friday, the US carried out the first wave of that retaliation, striking in Iraq and Syria against more than 85 targets that the US believed have connection with Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and militias it backs, reportedly killing nearly 40 people.The Houthis, who control the most populous parts of Yemen, say their attacks are ""in solidarity with Palestine as Israel strikes Gaza."" But the US and its allies characterize them as ""indiscriminate and a menace to global trade,"" Reuters reported.Liu Zhongmin, a professor at the Middle East Studies Institute of Shanghai International Studies University, told the Global Times on Sunday that ""before an end of the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, the Red Sea crisis is unlikely to be ended merely by US-led military operation. With the extension of the conflict in Gaza, its spillover effects in the Red Sea, Lebanon, Syria, Iraq and other areas in the Middle East will continue as well.""The confrontation between the US, Israel on one side and Iran on the other is intensifying, but the situation is still under control as both Washington and Tehran don't want to see escalation, so in the future, the Middle East will see more small conflicts but no war between major regional powers, Liu noted.US problematic approachesUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken is scheduled to travel to Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Qatar, Israel and the West Bank from Sunday through Thursday, according to a statement released Friday by the State Department.The tour will mark Blinken's fifth trip to the region since the latest round of Palestine-Israel conflict started on October 7, 2023, and this is a part of his ongoing effort to secure the release of hostages held by Hamas and work toward a humanitarian pause that would allow more aid to reach civilians in Gaza, the Voice of America reported.A large part of the diplomatic mission will be to push a proposal that calls for pauses in fighting in exchange for the release of hostages. On Friday, a senior Hamas official said that they will respond ""very soon"" to a proposal negotiated by Egypt, Qatari and US mediators in Paris earlier this week and approved by Israel.However, China analysts said the ""pause"" will never fundamentally solve the problem, as the ""pause"" means the parties in conflict have not yet realized their final goal, and the conflict will start again. While seeking ""pause"" by diplomatic approach, unfortunately, Washington has blocked many attempts by other members in the UN that try to pass a resolution for a cease-fire. Therefore, the spillover effect in other regions, like the Red Sea, will also continue, and the current situation in Gaza is not optimistic at all.Palestine news agency Wafa reported on Sunday that at least two children were killed in Israel attack on kindergarten in Rafah, Gaza. Houthi official Mohammed al-Bukhaiti said that the group's attacks in the Red Sea will continue until Israel ends its assault on Gaza, amid Israel air raids on Khan Younis and Rafah, Al-Jazeera reported on Sunday.Experts said US' failed handling of the Red Sea crisis and the Gaza crisis could lead to a global economic crisis. The countries who heavily rely on energy supplies from the Middle East via the Red Sea, such as EU members, who are also suffering from serious inflation, could be severely affected. The extension of the Red Sea crisis will add more pressure to their fragile economic recovery, they noted.",CHINA,SOCIETY,"A ship transits the Suez Canal towards the Red Sea on January 10, 2024 in Ismailia, Egypt.

90,"US airstrikes complicate Middle East; Dilemma a consequence of hegemony, benefits military-industrial complex",Zhang Han,2024-02-03,"US troops launched airstrikes on Friday, hitting at least 85 targets in Iraq and Syria, in retaliation of a drone attack the previous weekend that killed three US soldiers.The US, in a dilemma of ""responding without escalating the situation,"" is paying the price for its military-dependent path, which is a result of US hegemony and its military-industrial complex.The US government and several media outlets tried to depict the Friday retaliation as ""restrained"" by emphasizing the attacks were targeted and short, and ""far from the most pain the Pentagon was capable of delivering,"" as CNN put it.US President Joe Biden said the targets of the Friday airstrikes were facilities used by Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and ""affiliated militia."" He said retaliation ""will continue at a time and place of our choosing,"" and also reiterated that he does not seek a wider conflict in the Middle East but attacks on US troops can't go unanswered.The US had telegraphed its response for days, with senior US officials briefing about its nature, its severity, and even hinting at its targets, according to CNN.Engaging in excessive attacks on the militants would entangle the US further in the web of the Middle East crisis, a nightmare that the country is keen to avoid repeating. But at the same time, a feeble response would risk accusations of embarrassment and weakness on the global stage, Liu Zhongmin, a professor at the Middle East Studies Institute of Shanghai International Studies University, told the Global Times.Liu noted the fermenting chaos across the Middle East is becoming increasingly unfavorable for Joe Biden as the presidential election looms closer.However, no matter how ""carefully"" the US attempts to act, the retaliatory attacks will accelerate the vicious circle and further complicate current Middle East tensions, said analysts.The US' long, dominant presence in the Middle East has made itself and even the international community so accustomed to a military approach to assert so-called US leadership that the country cannot think or act alternatively in a way that can cool down the situation, they said.The multi-spot eruption of Middle East conflicts, from the initial conflicts in the Gaza to the Red Sea crisis, and the latest strikes, have caused headaches for the White House while having one beneficiary - the US military-industrial complex, Li Haidong, a professor at the China Foreign Affairs University, told the Global Times.""The tendency of US policy to serve the military-industrial complex will not change; it is a misfortune for the country and the world,"" Li said.US overseas arms sales surged 16 percent to a record $238 billion in Fiscal Year 2023, with rising demands due to major global military conflicts, according to a US State Department fact sheet released on Monday.While gradually losing control of the Middle East, the US cannot help blaming China for any adverse situation it encounters. A New York Times article on January 26, containing statements like ""China's seeming indifference to the Red Sea crisis reinforces the US' role as the world's predominant power,"" aimed to portray an ""irresponsible"" China as having to rely on the powerful US in order to safeguard its trade through the Red Sea.The Joe Biden administration has been making the case to Beijing that it should help quiet the Houthi attacks, US media outlet Politico reported, citing a senior US official.Here, the US is again thinking with a hegemonic mindset, but China's view on international relations and conflicts is never pressure or coercion, analysts said.Counting on China to pressure Iran, which the US claimed to be behind the militants, or any involved parties is an overly simplistic notion, because China is not in a position to pressure any party, said Liu.China Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin, when asked to comment on the deadly drone attacks on US military bases, said that ""We hope relevant parties will remain calm and exercise restraint, step up dialogue and communication, avoid getting into a vicious cycle of revenge, and prevent further escalation of tensions in the region.""Analysts noted the unrest in the Middle East has mainly stemmed from the Palestinian-Israeli Conflict, and a speedy end to direct conflicts in Gaza would help ease spillover tensions.China stands ready to work with all parties to hold a more broad-based, authoritative and effective international peace conference as early as possible, formulate a concrete timetable and roadmap for the implementation of the two-state solution and support Palestine and Israel in resuming peace talks soon for the ultimate peaceful and harmonious coexistence between Palestine and Israel, and between the Arabs and Jews, Wang said on Wednesday.",CHINA,DIPLOMACY,Photo:VCG,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'US': ('LOC', 14), 'Iraq': ('LOC', 1), 'Syria': ('LOC', 1), 'Iran': ('LOC', 1), 'Middle East': ('LOC', 6), 'Gaza': ('LOC', 1), 'Red Sea': ('LOC', 1), 'Hai': ('LOC', 1), 'China': ('LOC', 1), 'Pentagon': ('ORG', 1), 'CNN': ('ORG', 2), 'Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps': ('ORG', 1), 'IRGC': ('ORG', 1), 'Middle East Studies Institute': ('ORG', 1), 'Shanghai International Studies University': ('ORG', 2), 'Global Times': ('ORG', 1), 'House': ('ORG', 1), 'Joe Biden': ('PER', 2), 'Liu Zhongmin': ('PER', 2)}"
92,Crises in Ukraine and the Middle East linked by West's struggle for hegemony,Timofei Bordachev,2024-02-02,"From Russia's point of view, what is happening in the Gaza is a huge tragedy. The reason for this is the paralysis of international efforts to solve the Palestine-Israel conflict. This paralysis is the result of the actions of the US and, to a lesser extent, EU countries, for whom violent conflicts around the world are part of a great diplomatic game. The purpose of this game is to preserve the hegemony of the West in world affairs. Or, at the very least, to secure a better position after the complete hegemony has been destroyed by the irreversible effects of the changing balance of power on a global scale. The price of the West's strategy in the Middle East or Ukraine is tens of thousands of human lives. Therefore, the direct impact of the crisis in the Middle East on events in Eastern EU is determined by the ability of the US and its allies to maintain tension in several parts of the world at once, which so far, they have been able to do. Russia's position and interests in relation to various crises are determined by the fact that Russia is an economically self-sufficient power, generously endowed with natural resources and ready to develop open trade and economic relations with the whole world. That is why, when looking at the world from Moscow's perspective, there is no point in discussing regional conflicts from the point of view of material gain. For the past two years, Russia has been standing almost on its own against the enormous pressure from the whole of the West and against the economic war that is being waged against it. Against this backdrop, the Russia economy has shown convincing resilience and the ability to ensure an increase in the material well-being of its citizens. According to new forecasts by the International Monetary Fund, Russia's GDP growth in 2024 may reach 2.6 percent. The opening-up of the world and the willingness of many countries to cooperate are providing access to the goods and services that the West wanted to keep out of Russia's reach. Economic relations are developing with countries in Asia - with China in first place - as well as in Africa and Latin America. Transport along the Northern Sea Route in the Arctic reaches 36 million tons in 2023. More and more international companies will consider the possibility of using the Northern Sea Route if tensions in the Red Sea continue as a result of US and EU actions. Large container shipments between the Russia and China markets began along this route in the summer of 2023. At the same time, Russia understands the threat to international security if the situation around Gaza and in the Red Sea deteriorates further. Moscow shares China's concerns, which are based on the understanding that Red Sea waters are an important international corridor for goods and energy trade. Attacks on civilian ships are not an acceptable practice, but at the same time the actions of the US and its allies, who have been attacking sovereign Yemeni territory for several weeks now, are illegal. The only way to stop the worsening of the crisis is for all parties involved in the Gaza conflict to faithfully implement the UN and General Assembly resolutions.When we talk about the connection between the dramatic events in the Middle East and Ukraine, it is also necessary to take into account their historical and strategic basis. The Gaza escalation and the resulting Red Sea crisis are the product of a huge complex of regional contradictions that have accumulated over recent decades. At its core is the inability to implement the UN resolution on the establishment of two states in Palestine - Jewish and Saudi Arabia. Moreover, the whole balance of power in this important region of the world has changed after the US intervention in the fate of Iraq and Syria. The regional powers - Turkey, Iran and Saudi Arabia - also have their own views on how to build peace in the Middle East. Finally, the escalation in Gaza and the Red Sea is a serious threat to the world economy. The outcome could lead to a conflict that would destabilize the entire region, which is vital to the world's energy supply.The military confrontation in Ukraine is rooted in the post-Cold War policies of the US and NATO. Their actions, together with nationalist forces in Kiev, have created threats to Russia's security. In December 2021, Moscow offered the West a comprehensive plan to stabilize the EU security system. It was rejected. Similarly, the UN's resolution 2202 of February 17, 2015, which calls for the implementation of the Minsk agreements by all parties, was rejected. Therefore, a solution in Ukraine does not require the unraveling of a complex knot of regional contradictions in which many powers are involved. In contrast to the situation in the Middle East, peace in Ukraine can be easily achieved if the West and Kiev are willing to engage in a dialogue with Russia. This is exactly what China's peace proposals called for a year ago. So far, however, the West has not been willing to engage in such a dialogue.Therefore, from Russia's point of view, the main link between the two crises is the involvement of the US and its allies, either directly or through their subordinates. And so far, Washington is not expected any time soon to be ready for peace. Tragically, the price of the West's failure to recognize that there is more to the world than its interests continues to be paid with the lives of many peaceful people.The author is a program director of the Moscow-based Valdai Discussion Club. opinion@globaltimes.com.cn",OPINION,VIEWPOINT,"This photo taken on Jan. 27, 2024 shows the rubble in the southern Gaza Strip city of Rafah.

93,"Pelosi’s remarks against pro-Palestine protesters ‘shameful, outrageous’",Bai Yunyi,2024-01-31,"Recently, former US House speaker Nancy Pelosi, without any evidence, suggested some protesters calling for a ceasefire in Gaza are connected to Russia, sparking widespread skepticism. Against this backdrop, the US anti-war organization Code Pink posted a video on social media on Tuesday, which was shot in October of last year. The video shows a group of anti-war protesters blocking vehicle that Pelosi took, and the former House speaker reacted by unexpectedly telling the crowd, ""Go back to China, that's where your headquarters is."" Melissa Garriga, media relations manager for Code Pink, told the Global Times on Wednesday that those who are protesting Pelosi have received zero dollars from any foreign country or outside influence; they are simply constituents who don't want to see their tax dollars funding the extermination of Palestine. It is shameful for the former Speaker of the House to insinuate that those advocating for peace are somehow UN-US. And such a statement not only undermines the fundamental principles of US democracy but also constitutes a slanderous attack, Garriga said. ""It is Pelosi who receives money to represent the interests of foreign countries,"" she said. Code Pink on Sunday released a statement, in which the organization claimed that over the years, Rep. Pelosi has received over half a million dollars from pro-Israel lobbying groups. The accusations from someone as powerful as Pelosi should unite people in outrage at the notion that, according to her, being US requires surrender to the genocide of another population. Code Pink, alongside a growing majority of US, staunchly rejects such a notion. The Palestine death toll from a deadly Israel offensive on the Gaza has reached 26,637 since October 7 last year, the Health Ministry in the enclave said on Monday, Anadolu Agency reports.Pelosi is facing criticism after suggesting some pro-Palestine protesters are ""connected to Russia,"" some US media reported. She told at a CNN program that for those to call for a ceasefire is Vladimir Putin's message, referring to Russia President Vladimir Putin.The comments came as pro-Palestine protesters demanding a ceasefire in the Israel-Palestine war in Gaza have consistently interrupted US President Joe Biden's events as well as Pelosi's own recent event in Seattle, CNN said. And Pelosi suggested that some protesters are connected to Russia, saying that some financing should be investigated. The Council on US-Islamic Relations (CAIR) on Sunday condemned Pelosi for linking pro-Palestine protesters to Russia, the Hill reported. A short time after Pelosi's remarks aired on CNN, CAIR National Executive Director Nihad Awad condemned Pelosi's comments in a statement that referred to her remarks as an ""unsubstantiated smear,"" according to the US media report. The same voices have persistently advocated for peace over the past 20 years. They are the activists who have rightfully objected to all of the US' deadly and destabilizing wars and foreign policies, including the Iraq war, which Pelosi has supported, Garriga said.""This accusation leveled at antiwar dissent is a tale as old as time,"" she said. When the group Women's Strike for Peace formed in the sixties to oppose nuclear weapons, their activism landed them unjustly before the House UN-US Activities Committee. The same slanderous tactic was a popular choice by racist lawmakers who used it in an attempt to silence civil rights such as Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr, Garriga noted. The US has played a significant role in the suffering of Palestine at the hands of Israel by maintaining its position as the biggest funder of Israel's military, Garriga said. ""Despite Israel's genocide against Palestine, the US has repeatedly expressed its support for the occupying forces and continues to send military aid so that the genocide continues,"" she said, noting that ""we demand our government call for an immediate ceasefire and to cease all military aid to Israel and support Palestine's legal right to return to their homelands.""""Also, we have no plans of stopping until the genocide ends, those responsible are held accountable and the Palestine is free,"" she added.",CHINA,POLITICS,Photo: From Code Pink website,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'US House': ('ORG', 3), 'Code Pink': ('ORG', 4), 'Global Times': ('ORG', 1), 'UN': ('ORG', 1), 'Health Ministry': ('ORG', 1), 'Anadolu Agency': ('ORG', 1), 'CNN': ('ORG', 2), 'Council': ('ORG', 1), 'Nancy Pelosi': ('PER', 6), 'Melissa Garriga': ('PER', 2), 'Rep': ('PER', 1), 'Psi': ('PER', 3), 'Vladimir Putin': ('PER', 2), 'Joe B': ('PER', 1), 'Gaza': ('LOC', 3), 'Russia': ('LOC', 4), 'US': ('LOC', 8), 'China': ('LOC', 1), 'Palestine': ('LOC', 5), 'Israel': ('LOC', 3), 'Seattle': ('LOC', 1), 'pro': ('MISC', 1)}"
94,China expected to play bigger role in Middle East: Yemeni official,Chen Qingqing,2024-01-31,"China said on Tuesday that it supports Yemen's sovereignty, territorial integrity and supports the legitimate government of the country and a resolution to the Yemen issue through political means. Amid the escalating Red Sea crisis, Yemen also expects China to play a bigger role in promoting peace and stability in the Middle East. The Yemen issue has been cooling down since Saudi Arabia and Iran resumed diplomatic relations, and Yemen has also recognized China's role in the Yemen situation, some China experts said. While it may be difficult for China to play a direct role in the ongoing confrontations between the Houthi group and the US and the UK regarding the situation in the Red Sea, China can play a role in maintaining political stability in Yemen. This is particularly important in preventing a resurgence of the conflict between the Houthi group and the Yemeni government, experts noted. The traditional friendship between China and Yemen is deep-rooted, with Yemen being one of the earliest Saudi Arabia countries to establish diplomatic relations with China. China highly appreciates Yemen's long-standing and steadfast support on issues that involve China's core interests, Vice Foreign Minister Deng Li told Under-Secretary of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Expatriates of Yemen Mansour Baggash on Tuesday in Beijing.  China is willing to continue strengthening political mutual trust, enhancing exchanges and cooperation in various fields with Yemen, and promoting the further development of China-Yemen relations, Deng said. The senior China diplomat noted that China supports the sovereignty, independence, unity, and territorial integrity of Yemen, as well as the legitimate government of Yemen. China supports the peaceful resolution of the Yemen issue through political means and also supports the UN to play a just and balanced role as the main channel for mediation. China is willing to work with the international community to facilitate the early restoration of peace and stability in Yemen, Deng said. The meeting between China and Yemeni diplomats took place amid escalating Red Sea tensions, as the commander of the Houthi militia on Tuesday said the group is ready for a long-term confrontation with the US and Britain. On Monday, the group said they attacked a US Navy mobile base at sea without offering evidence, although the statement was immediately rejected by an US defense official, the AP reported. The Houthi group has escalated their attacks on Israel-bound ships in Red Sea since the Palestine-Israel conflict broke out. The Houthis claim the attacks are in response to Israel's bombardment of Gaza, media reports said. Commenting on the meeting between China and Yemeni diplomats, China Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said on Tuesday that China's position on the Palestinian-Israeli Conflict and the Red Sea situation is consistent and clear. We advocate an immediate ceasefire in Gaza, protection of civilians, alleviation of the humanitarian situation, realization of the two-State solution, and joint international efforts to keep the shipping lanes in the Red Sea safe, Wang noted.The root of the Yemen crisis is linked to the Palestine issue, which has long remained unresolved, including the Gaza crisis. Behind the scenes, there is a power struggle between forces represented by Iran and those represented by the US and Israel, Sun Degang, director of the Center for Middle Eastern Studies at Fudan University, told the Global Times on Wednesday. As China has also expressed concerns about the Red Sea and the Palestine-Israel conflict and hopes to promote de-escalation of the crisis, and China does not wish to see US and West powers exacerbate the situation, Sun said. ""From this meeting, it is clear that Yemen also hopes that China can play a more proactive and positive role in the region.""Yemen appreciates China's efforts to facilitate the political resolution process of the Yemeni issue, Baggash said during the meeting, and expressed gratitude for China's objective and impartial stance on the Palestine-Israel conflict and positively acknowledges China's role in facilitating the historic reconciliation between Saudi Arabia and Iran. Yemen looks forward to China playing a greater role in promoting peace and stability in the Middle East region, and both sides also exchanged views on regional and international issues of mutual concern, including the Palestine-Israel conflict and the situation in the Red Sea. Since the resumption of diplomatic relations between Saudi Arabia and Iran, it appears that the situation in Yemen has been cooling down. The Houthi group has been actively seeking reconciliation with the government over the past year, and the group's relationship with Saudi Arabia has been improving, Liu Zhongmin, a professor at the Middle East Studies Institute of Shanghai International Studies University, told the Global Times on Wednesday. ""From this perspective, Yemen seems to have directly expressed its recognition of China's role, especially in successfully facilitating reconciliation between Saudi Arabia and Iran,"" Liu said. While it may be difficult for China to play a direct role in the current Red Sea crisis involving the Houthi group and the US and the UK, it can play a role in maintaining political stability in Yemen, Liu noted.  ""Particularly, China can contribute to preventing a resurgence of conflicts or the outbreak of a new civil war in Yemen, which remains a real risk. In this regard, China's involvement could encompass working with the Yemeni government and even indirectly engaging with Iran and Saudi Arabia,"" he said.",CHINA,DIPLOMACY,"An Israeli Navy missile boat is seen in the area of the Red Sea on Nov. 1, 2023.

95,Pelosi’s remarks reflect the truth of US system,Ding Gang,2024-01-31,"According to reports from US media outlets, amid ongoing Israel-Palestine conflicts, a group of pro-Palestine protesters gathered outside former US house speaker Nancy Pelosi's San Francisco home. In response to their demonstration, Pelosi reportedly shouted to them, ""Go back to China where your headquarters is!"" This is a veteran US politician's interpretation of the war in Gaza.Pelosi's remarks have elicited a range of reactions from the public, including ridicule, sarcasm and surprise. Some critics have accused her of lacking the decorum expected of a politician, while others have labeled her comments as overtly racist or as perpetuating the ""China threat"" narrative. Just a day prior to this incident, Pelosi suggested to CNN host Dana Bash that the pro-Palestine protesters calling for a cease-fire were linked to Russia, further accusing them of spreading ""messages"" from Russia President Vladimir Putin.Such flip-flopping and seemingly irrational statements are not typically associated with a seasoned US politician. Yet, it's crucial to remember that Pelosi has been a dominant political figure in the country for over two decades, serving twice as the Speaker of the House and becoming the first woman to hold that position, as well as the first woman to lead a major party in either chamber of Congress.Is Nancy Pelosi then an anomaly in the mature landscape of US politics? Quite the contrary; she epitomizes the very essence of the US political establishment - a product of its system, deeply entrenched in its ways. Pelosi's career, marked by decades of legislative work, has both influenced and been shaped by the evolution of US congressional politics. Her approach to the Israel-Palestine conflict, viewing it as an opportunity to deflect blame rather than addressing the substantive issues at hand, reflects a broader trend among politicians to prioritize political maneuvering over genuine problem-solving.Pelosi's impromptu comments reveal a troubling aspect of how some US politicians engage with international politics. There seems to be a constant drive to ""sell"" politics, to engage in political theatrics rather than govern with integrity and foresight. The current fixation on the ""China threat"" narrative among some US lawmakers has become a psychological trap, a self-fulfilling prophecy that they seem unable to escape, bordering on obsession rather than rational policy-making.This incident sheds light on the deeper issue of how anti-China sentiment, often manifested in malicious legislative proposals aimed at sanctioning China, has become more about political posturing than addressing real geopolitical challenges. There is an old China saying: What you say after being drunk is the truth. Pelosi's shouting, though not made under the influence of alcohol, suggest a sort of intoxication with the illusion of a China threat - a distortion that has made some US policymakers seem drunk.For those hoping for a stable and constructive development in US-China relations, news like this offers little to laugh about. The US is in its 2024 presidential election cycle, the political nightmares conjured by such rhetoric only serve to deepen the shadow of the China threat in the minds of voters.Since US politics is a big theater, it is bound to have an absurd side, and the trouble now is that its absurd side has become the main line of the plot. This is due to the fierce rivalry between the two parties and the division of the society, and its damage is not just to the foreign relations of the US, but to the whole society of the US. And the current US politicians can't manage this drama, they can only be the players, just like Pelosi, indulging in the China threat theory of their own making.The author is a senior editor with People's Daily, and currently a senior fellow with the Chongyang Institute for Financial Studies at Renmin University of China. dinggang@globaltimes.com.cn.

96,Why is it difficult for Washington to have new-generation leaders,Zhang Wenzong,2024-01-31,"

The current situation in the primary stage of the 2024 US presidential election indicates an increasing possibility of a rematch between former president Donald Trump, representing the Republican Party, and the incumbent Democratic President Joe Biden. As the oldest president in US history, Joe Biden is 81 years old, while Donald Trump, who swore to ""take back"" the country, is 77 years old. Recent polls show that majorities in the US don't want Joe Biden and Donald Trump to run in 2024. But these two are still engaged in the political race. Will people witness an ""ultimate showdown"" of the older generation of US politicians in the 2024 election? Why have the young politicians of the new generation in the US not yet taken important positions in both parties? Even some US media outlets cannot help but ask this question.In terms of the presidential election, the Democratic Party had a precedent and tradition of having young political elites entering the White House after World War II. John F. Kennedy, Bill Clinton and Barack Obama all became US presidents in their 40s. Obama, born in the 1960s, was 47 years old in the 2008 election. Given the strong dissatisfaction of US voters with the financial crisis, two wars in the Middle East and the Republican Party, he won a sweeping victory both inside and outside the party. In the 2016 election, Hillary Clinton, full of confidence and prepared to take over the Oval Office, unexpectedly lost to Donald Trump. In 2020, the Democratic Party could only keep promoting Joe Biden, who had the qualifications, experience and reputation to counter Donald Trump. Influential young political forces within the Democratic Party have become increasingly scarce.In both the 2016 and 2024 elections, some young competitors emerged within the Republican Party, but they were unable to compete with Donald Trump. Federal senators Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio, who are extremely anti-China, are still considered ""not populist enough."" Vivek Ramaswamy, a 38-year-old Indian-US businessman, has not enough experience. Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, who was fiercely suppressed by Donald Trump, dared not break with him. Former vice president Mike Pence and former New Jersey governor Chris Christie, who represent the establishment faction and adopt an ""anti-Donald Trump"" stance, have no chance to win. Nikki Haley, former US ambassador to the UN, has decided to continue participating in the Republican Party primaries and tries to highlight her age advantage. However, it is difficult for Haley to counter Donald Trump.The decline of young politicians from both parties in recent elections is also related to the polarization of US politics and the design of the primary system. The lack of a bottom line in the fierce fighting and public opinion manipulation between the two parties has made the base voters of both sides see each other as enemies and feel that they cannot afford to lose. Democratic voters believe that Joe Biden is the ""only person in the party who can defeat and will defeat Donald Trump again,"" while the other side believes that only Donald Trump and his ""Make America Great Again"" movement can boost the economy, end overseas conflicts, defend border security and uphold conservative values. Both party members and voters need candidates with sufficient influence and symbolism. Therefore, for Joe Biden and Donald Trump, who are the current and former presidents, age is not the issue now.On a broader political level within the US, there has been a constant struggle for the transition of power between the old and new generations. For instance, in every election, groups of young individuals are elected as members of Congress, governors and state legislators. Among the aspiring wealthy newcomers in politics, there are also many young faces. This trend is driven by the generational shift in the US population. In 2021, the combined population of the ""Generation X"" (born between 1964 and 1980), ""Millennials"" (born between 1981 and 1996), and ""Generation Z"" (born between 1997 and 2012) accounted for over 60 percent of the total population in the US. This large population base and voter group will inevitably give birth to a new generation of US politicians. Compared to the ""Baby Boomer"" generation (born between 1946 and 1964), which consists of a significant number of ""old white males,"" the new generation is characterized by greater racial diversity, diverse values, an increase in female representation and a significant proportion of immigrants. These changes overall favor the Democratic Party in expanding its voter base and force the Republican Party to actively seek and attract more ethnic minorities and women. The possibility of having presidents from the post-1970s and post-1980s generations, a female president and another ethnic minority president will increase in the future.Our world is undergoing accelerating changes unseen in a century, and the relationship between the US and the world is also facing significant changes. Both Joe Biden and Donald Trump were born around the end of World War II. Experiencing the ""Golden Age"" of the US in their childhood, witnessing the US' triumph in the Cold War in midlife and observing the country's decline in its later years, after enjoying the ""unipolar moment,"" they now harbor anxiety, and are intolerant of other major nations rising to prominence. Although these two politicians from the post-1940s generation differ in political affiliation, ideology and style, they share common ground in adhering to cold war thinking, upholding US hegemony and striving to control the world.It is difficult to predict whether the new generation of US politicians, especially those who may compete in future presidential elections, will be those who stubbornly adhere to conservative Cold War thinking, or rational and pragmatic figures like California Governor Gavin Newsom, or individuals from the business world like Elon Musk. However, one thing is certain - in the current world where the Russia-Ukraine conflict, the Israel-Palestine conflict, group politics and great power competition are escalating, and where ""decoupling"" and ""building walls and barriers"" are prevalent, the role of the US as the sole superpower remains crucial. The choice of the winner of the 2024 US presidential election regarding strategies and policies will have significant implications for whether the world is heading toward more conflicts and a comprehensive cold war or toward cease-fire and restraint. This choice determines whether the torch passed on to future generations of US will be one that lights the way forward or ignites a powder keg in the world. It will not only affect the US but peace and stability around the world.The author is deputy director and a research fellow of the Institute of US Studies, the China Institutes of Contemporary International Relations. opinion@globaltimes.com.cn",OPINION,VIEWPOINT,Photo: VCG,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'US': ('LOC', 10), 'White House': ('LOC', 1), 'Middle East': ('LOC', 1), 'Oval Office': ('LOC', 1), 'China': ('LOC', 1), 'Florida': ('LOC', 1), 'New Jersey': ('LOC', 1), 'Donald Trump': ('PER', 8), 'Joe Biden': ('PER', 4), 'John F.

Editor's Note:  The US and UK ""must be held accountable for the conduct and what is happening within Gaza,"" said Wikus van Rensburg (Rensburg), a South African attorney leading a group of nearly 50 lawyers in a class-action lawsuit against the two countries for their complicity in Israel's actions in Gaza. In an interview with Global Times (Global Times) reporter Wang Wenwen on her I-Talk show, Rensburg talked about his plan. Despite the challenges ahead, he remains positive.Global Times: Why do you plan to sue the US and UK?Rensburg: It is because we feel that the complicity by both the US and the UK, in terms of financial support as well as the military equipment provided, is unjustified, as Gaza is a nonmilitary area. Israel, in our opinion, is exceeding the boundaries of self-defense. While self-defense is acceptable to a certain extent, it becomes excessive beyond a certain point. Furthermore, their actions are not helping resolve the situation. With the continuous bombardment, the tensions are spilling over into other parts of the region. That is concerning as it could lead to a more massive aggression between different countries. You've seen the attacks in the Red Sea as an example now, and in Yemen. But West countries are not doing anything, we feel that they are complicit in what is happening there.Global Times: For a long time, there has been a lack of accountability regarding the US' actions in Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan. How will your lawsuit underscore the importance of giving due significance to this issue?Rensburg: We will be bringing the spotlight to the issue. Germany is still paying for the World War II and the holocaust that was committed there.To my knowledge, no other country has been held accountable like Germany for war crimes. While I cannot definitively say that war crimes are currently being committed, it is my opinion that they are. However, that is something that the ICJ (International Court of Justice) must still consider. America has been, I think, involved in over 30 to 60 wars since the World War II. No other country has got such a track record and says it is just protecting the world. Well, it's protecting its own interests and not the world. Wikus van Rensburg Photo: Courtesy of RensburgGT: How confident are you in your lawsuit?Rensburg: This will be the first such lawsuit in the world. For us, it comes down to accountability and justice. Someone must be held accountable for the conduct and what is happening within Gaza. And hopefully, if we can set a precedent, the rest of the world will take notice and not just blindly support the conduct of this nature, because there is no accountability in the world. I would say [the probability of us winning the case] is 50 percent plus 1, to put it mildly. We feel very strongly that there is sufficient evidence out there that proves what is happening there. And America has got specific legislation which holds them accountable for supporting conduct of this nature. The Bush administration tried to have that legislation rejected by the court in the early 2000s and was unsuccessful and that legislation still stands, which says you can sue the US government for their conduct internationally within the US courts.Global Times: Have you got any feedback from the US and UK governments so far?Rensburg: Nothing. We didn't expect a response because practicing law in South Africa and writing letters of such a nature normally doesn't elicit a response. The people or whoever you intend to sue just have a general attitude: Take me to court; until I'm in court, I don't care about what you have to say. So we'll have to wait to get them to court to see what their reaction is.Global Times: You are suing the two most powerful West countries. What challenges do you foresee?Rensburg: Our major challenge will be money and time. We are doing it on a pro bono basis, which means the time spent at the moment is free. We're not charging for any of the time we dedicate to it. Our concern is to get our witnesses and our evidence as the case will progress eventually to court in the US and in the UK. Then we'll probably be requesting the international community for some assistance for us to present our case.Another obstacle is time. Any litigation does take time. But by playing legal tactics and legal maneuvering, you can delay a matter. That means time is not on our side, because it takes a substantial time from one court date to another court date. I think you've seen with how Donald Trump's criminal case is being delayed. It's just an example. But ultimately, we will get to court.Global Times: Besides collaborating with legal professionals in the US and UK, have you tried to seek help from anywhere else?Rensburg: No. Myself and a colleague started discussing this, and we initiated the letters. How it started doing the rounds, I've got no idea, because I'm not on social media and I don't believe in social media. I started getting phone calls, emails, whatsapp messages from other South African practitioners. They said, ""We believe in what you want to do, can we assist, can we join you?"" That's when I created the whatsapp group where they started joining and we are discussing this whole concept, and they said that they'd like to help, and that's how it came about. We are getting no government assistance from the South African government.Our matter is purely what is right and wrong. We've also been accused of being anti-Semitic, anti-Jewish, pro-Palestine, Islamic jihad or whatever. I'm a South African, white, male, Christian. I'm probably the most unlikely candidate to run a case like this. But what is right is right, and what's wrong is wrong. We deem that they are exceeding the boundaries of self-defense. This is a matter of law and justice, not about religion.Global Times: Your country, South Africa, has brought Israel to the ICJ. South Africa is a representative of the Global South. Do you think the actions of your government and people like you will help raise the voices of the Global South on the world stage?Rensburg: I hope so. Just generally looking at the EU and America, I don't agree with their policies and practices. They look down on the southern hemisphere as insignificant countries in Africa and South America. It's about time that they do take notice of our past and our experiences, and it's about time for the rest of the world to accept accountability and responsibility.Global Times: What do you think of China's position in the Israel-Palestine conflict?Rensburg: I agree with your policy and principles you promote. There should be a cease-fire. There should be mediation, and this conflict should be resolved, because it's not to the advantage of the region nor the world and everything that is accompanied with that.Now, China, in my opinion, has been playing an extremely brave and good diplomatic role in seeking peace, not getting involved in the conflict and all the political bickering back and forth. Some would say, China is waiting for the opportunity to pounce. I don't believe it. China's stance is very mediatory. They are playing the correct supporting role by saying, let's talk peace and let's see if we can resolve this. Cease-fire, I totally agree with, because lives are being lost every day. It's not justified, and the conflict is just escalating. Our concern is, is it ever going to de-escalate, and if so when is it going to start to de-escalate? So I do support China's approach.",OPINION,VIEWPOINT,"In this image provided by the UK Ministry of Defence, a Royal Air Force Typhoon FGR4 is prepared to take off and carry out Air Strikes against Houthi military targets in Yemen, on January 22, 2024.

98,"As biggest broker for US arms industry, Washington greatly profits from Russia-Ukraine conflict",Global Times,2024-01-30,"In 2023, the world was in turmoil, with the Russia-Ukraine war dragging on and the conflict in the Gaza reoccurring. As the demand for weapons rose dramatically in many parts of the world, the US, known as a non-stop war machine, delivered yet another ""outstanding"" year-end performance review of foreign military sales: a record $238 billion. This figure was released by the US State Department on Monday. With a 16 percent increase from 2022, the growth in US military equipment sales to foreign governments last year was primarily driven by significant deals prompted by the Russia-Ukraine war. The biggest deals were a trio of sales worth about $30 billion for attack and transport helicopters, and long-range missile launchers to Poland and Germany, according to a report from Politico.Since the outbreak of the current war in Ukraine, the US government has continued to fuel the conflict by supplying weapons to Kiev. Consequently, US arms dealers have experienced a surge in orders. Additionally, EU countries, due to ammunition production issues and the growing ""fear of Russia,"" have thrown themselves into the embrace of US arms dealers. As a result, the US military-industrial complex has profited greatly from the Russia-Ukraine conflict.As the conflict is about to enter its third year, more evidence is emerging that the US is the manipulator behind the scenes and the primary beneficiary. Washington aims to amplify the ""Russia threat"" theory to intimidate EU countries into an arms race, ultimately advancing US interests at the expense of EU, Russia and Ukraine.From Ukraine to the Middle East, the escalation of war is undoubtedly good news for US arms dealers who always seek to reap huge profits from turmoil. There is an evident close connection between the US arms industry and politics, and the new record of US foreign military sales proves only one thing: The US is, indeed, a great source of unrest in the world.The US government has, in fact, fed a voracious monster within the country - the military-industrial complex. In the face of this colossal military-industrial complex, Washington proudly showcases its new record, akin to a salesman impressing his boss with his accomplishments in 2023.Lü Xiang, a research fellow at the China Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times that as a series of elections approach, the State Department released the number of US foreign military sales in 2023 to impress arms dealers in the country. It's very likely Washington intends to showcase the Joe Biden administration's achievement as an ""arms salesman"" in order to gain support from the arms industry for the Democratic Party in the upcoming Congress and presidential election, the China scholar said.The influence of the military-industrial complex on US politics is pervasive. For many US politicians, whether they are Republican or Democrat, it is natural to advocate for the arms dealers who fund their campaigns. On a larger scale, neither of the two parties nor the US government dare to offend the US military-industrial complex.The US military-industrial complex now wields significant influence over US national policy and, to some extent, has hijacked the government. The US State Department said in a statement on Monday that arms transfers and defense trade are ""important US foreign policy tools with potential long-term implications for regional and global security,"" demonstrating the close relationship between US arms sales and foreign policy.In many cases, Washington uses its foreign policy to provoke chaos and confrontation, artificially creating a demand for more arms in many countries. By constantly promoting narratives, such as the ""Russia threat"" and ""China threat,"" the US government has helped US arms dealers boost the sale of military equipment, making it the biggest broker for the US arms industry. As long as there are military sales, the US will never tire of war. It is expected that the growth of US foreign military sales will continue unabated in 2024, while the US will continue to allow conflicts to victimize innocent people in hotspot areas and fill the pockets of US arms dealers.",OPINION,OBSERVER,Profiting from war.

99,US arms sales hit record high in FY2023 as diplomacy 'kidnapped by military-industrial complex',Wang Qi,2024-01-30,"US overseas arms sales surged 16 percent to a record $238 billion in Fiscal Year (FY) 2023, with rising demands due to major global military conflicts, according to a US State Department fact sheet released on Monday local time. China analyst said on Tuesday that the rising sales figures not only show the increasing geopolitical tensions incited by the US, but also outline an unfortunate fact that US diplomacy has been deeply kidnapped by the military-industrial complex.According to the US State Department, in FY2023, the US Foreign Military Sales system directly negotiated $80.9 billion in sales, a 55.9 percent increase from FY2022. The remaining 157.5 billion were direct commercial sales (DCS), which represents a 2.5 percent increase compared to FY2022's figure. The most noticeable sales included $12 billion worth of High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS) to Poland, $8.5 billion worth of CH-47F Chinook Helicopters to Germany, and National Advanced Surface to Air Missile Systems (NASAMS) to Ukraine. The Czech Republic bought $5.6bn in F-35 jets and munitions.Beyond EU, the US also sold billions of dollars worth of weapons to allies in the Middle East and Asia-Pacific regions, according to their fact sheet. Big Asian deals included South Korea's $5.62 billion F-35 Aircraft order and $1.5 billion CH-47F Chinook order. Behind the growth of arms sales, the US has created or intensified conflicts and crises in different regions of the world, forcing other countries to increase their budgets and buy US weapons to better serve the interests of the military-industrial complex, Li Haidong, a professor at the China Foreign Affairs University, told the Global Times on Tuesday.While it remains uncertain as to whether the US would be drawn into a more protracted war in the Middle East with the spillover of the Gaza crisis expanding, US arms sales to Ukraine and its NATO allies will continue, since there is no end in sight to the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Meanwhile, the US is also advancing its ""Indo-Pacific"" strategy to contain China with its allies, fanning the flames in the Korean Peninsula, Taiwan Straits and South China Sea, according to analysts. ""Arms sales and transfers are important US foreign policy tools with potential long-term implications for regional and global security,"" the State Department said in a statement.""US military sales abroad in FY2024 are likely to continue to grow,"" Li said, ""the tendency of US policy serving the military-industrial complex will not change in the long run either.""It is indeed a great misfortune for the US that its foreign policy has been divorced from the needs of its own people and has been basically kidnapped by the military-industrial complex, the expert remarked. Those sales, in Politico's view, indicate the Joe Biden administration is ""working to seize the moment in EU and Asia to wean countries off Russia arms imports and increase domestic defense manufacturing.""Reuters stated that rising figures ""underpin expectations of stronger sales for the likes of Lockheed Martin, General Dynamics and Northrop Grumman, whose shares are forecast to rise amid growing global instability.""China military expert Song Zhongping told the Global Times on Tuesday that in essence, US arm sales serve US military hegemony, and that makes the US government the biggest arms dealer on Earth. US politicians' constant hype of the ""Russia threat"" and the ""China threat"" is prompting the sales of weapons to win the support of US arms dealers in elections, Song said, adding that ""there is almost no difference between the Democratic or Republican parties.""",CHINA,DIPLOMACY,"Residents protest in Taipei with an American flag showing guns and dollars and a banner saying ""Anti Proxy War"" against US arms dealers entering the island of Taiwan, on May 3, 2023.

100,UNRWA cannot come to a standstill in Gaza because of this: Global Times editorial,Global Times,2024-01-29,"The UN in the Near East (UN), has become the latest focus of the Israel-Palestine conflict, with allegations of its staffers' involvement in October's attack on Israel. The allegations have complicated the already fragile humanitarian situation in Gaza. So far, 10 countries, including the largest donor, the US, have announced the suspension of funding for UN. On January 28, the spokesperson for UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres released a statement disclosing the investigation into the incident. It stated that ""any UN employee involved in acts of terror will be held accountable, including through criminal prosecution,"" but urged donor countries to ""guarantee the continuity of UN's operations"" to maintain the much-needed assistance to Gaza. The international community, including the UN itself, has taken the allegations of UN employees being involved in the attack seriously. It is believed that the UN will conduct a thorough investigation and take appropriate action, providing a responsible account to the international community. It is necessary to emphasize that both the ongoing probe and the future investigation results should be handled on a case-by-case basis, without politicizing or exaggerating the issue. In particular, precautions should be taken to prevent any serious secondary humanitarian disaster resulting from this incident. UN is one of the oldest UN agencies and the largest UN agency in Gaza. Since the start of this conflict, 1.7 million people have sought refuge or received services in over 150 UN shelters and distribution sites. Food, water, education, and healthcare in Gaza largely depend on UN. It is not an exaggeration to say that it is the last lifeline for 2.2 million people. The funding of this agency is almost entirely provided by donors, and it has been in a financially tight or even crisis state for many years. The countries that have currently announced the suspension of funding are important donor countries, with their donations accounting for a significant proportion of the organization's funds. Although most countries currently claim to suspend funding during the ""investigation period,"" the concept of the ""investigation period"" is vague, and it is still unknown how long the funding will be suspended.The UN announced on Sunday that UN's current funding will not allow it to meet all requirements of the aid recipients in February. At that time, the agency may find it difficult to maintain its previous operational status, and may even face the possibility of a shutdown. It is particularly noteworthy that Israel has previously stated that the Israel government will implement a policy to prevent UN from operating in the Gaza after the current round of Israel-Palestine conflict ends. Considering UN's pivotal position in local organizations within the UN, this will restrain the UN's role in Gaza and the Middle East, and deal a major blow to the increasingly dire humanitarian situation in the Gaza.During the era of the Donald Trump administration, the US temporarily suspended donations to the agency and even planned to propose alternative solutions. However, after the Joe Biden administration took office, it gradually resumed funding and adopted a cooperative attitude toward UN. Apart from Washington's change in stance, the main reason for this is that there is currently no alternative to UN, and it remains the only hope for Palestine refugees. The international community has broad consensus that ""collective punishment"" against the Gaza population for condemning and combating terrorism is unacceptable and humanitarian needs should be guaranteed. It is completely unnecessary to take sides on this matter. The alleged involvement of UN employees in the October 7 attack should be dealt with objectively and fairly, and the international community should increase support for UN rather than reduce it. As for the complex situation in the Gaza, the two-state solution is the only viable option that can achieve a comprehensive, fair, and lasting resolution to the Palestine issue. In the slow progress of the ""two-state solution,"" UN has played an indispensable role in providing much-needed assistance to Palestine refugees. It is a shared responsibility of all parties to continue supporting and maintaining the authority and status of the UN.",OPINION,EDITORIAL,Blocking aid.

102,"Everyone should wake up to US’ blame game in Red Sea, Ukraine crises",James Smith,2024-01-29,"Recently, the US asked China to ""help"" maintain the flow of Red Sea shipping. The US is currently in a state of conflict with Houthi rebels in Yemen. The cause of the conflict is a failure of the US to push for a ceasefire and peace negotiations in Israel, which has caused regional tensions and instability. The US and UK, in turn, have responded with a bombing campaign in Yemen. However, according to US officials, it is China who should apparently be making the peace.We've heard this all before. The US has also repeatedly stated that it is China's responsibility to ensure peace in the Ukraine conflict too. However, the reality is that in both scenarios, not only does US foreign policy run completely contrary to the interests of peace, but moreover, the White House has no intention in either instance of attempting a balanced peace scenario brokered on China's terms. Instead, what is being asked is that Beijing capitulates to enforcing US-centric goals and interests in respect to each conflict. And of course, because US officials know there is no chance of that happening, the goal of these public overtures is merely a propaganda effort to smear China as being responsible or culpable for the given wars that US is in fact escalating, and thus to frame China as a threat to the international order.US foreign policy is not driven by an attempt to ensue balance, peace or stability, but on a prerequisite goal that it must always maintain unilateralist hegemony at all costs. To this end, contemporary US foreign policymaking, unlike the Cold War, does not yield a notion of compromise with states that it deems to be adversaries. Rather, its objectives focus on preventing the breakdown of unipolarity and enabling strategic competitors to emerge which challenge the post-1991 status quo. In other words, the US pursues maximalist goals and does not compromise on ""strategic space"" in its diplomacy and continually aims to expand its leverage.That is why, for example, the US was not prepared to compromise on the subject of NATO in order to alleviate tensions with Russia or bring a swift end to the Ukraine conflict. Instead, it sets itself on a policy that aimed to use the conflict as a means to impose a zero-sum strategic defeat on Moscow so that it could eliminate them as a competitor and destroy economic integration between Russia and EU. The US only finds a peace outcome acceptable if it supports all its strategic goals. Given this, when China proposed a peace plan for the Ukraine conflict last year, the US readily dismissed it. Yet at the same time, the US had repeatedly asked China to put ""pressure"" on Russia, to end the conflict. What does this mean? It does not mean brokering a peace or a mutually acceptable resolution, but rather subduing Moscow to follow US foreign policy preferences, which is of course a total non-starter. China isn't being asked to make peace or find a mutually acceptable resolution, but to act on the behalf of the US.Therefore, as China will not support unilateralist US foreign policy goals in seeking peace, the US subsequently uses this to push a narrative that China is a ""threat"" to the peace. This is the propaganda game played by US officials. It is an act of ""gaslighting"" to demand that China support ""peace,"" when in fact it means supporting ""US strategic goals."" When China does not comply, it is accused of deliberately prolonging and enabling the conflict. The mainstream media in turn responds by assuming that China ""supports"" the side against the US in the given conflict. In the process, the narrative then whitewashes the actual culpability America has in having created those wars in the first place through its pursuit of unilateralist and zero-sum policies. One example of this is refusing to compromise on the expansion of NATO, or alternatively, giving Israel unconditional and uncritical backing in the war on Gaza and even resorting to more military solutions when the instability escalates. Yet China, a bystander, who does not have a direct stake in any of these conflicts, and would prefer peace and stability as its primary goals, is somehow framed as the threat in a conspiracy against the West. This is the game the US plays, and everyone should wake up to it. The author is a political and historical relations analyst. opinion@globaltimes.com.cn",OPINION,VIEWPOINT,Illustration: Chen Xia /GT,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'US': ('LOC', 15), 'China': ('LOC', 6), 'Red Sea': ('LOC', 1), 'Yemen': ('LOC', 2), 'Israel': ('LOC', 1), 'UK': ('LOC', 1), 'Ukraine': ('LOC', 2), 'White House': ('LOC', 1), 'Beijing': ('LOC', 1), 'Russia': ('LOC', 2), 'Moscow': ('LOC', 1), 'Houthi': ('MISC', 1), 'Cold War': ('MISC', 1), 'NATO': ('ORG', 1), 'EU': ('ORG', 1)}"
103,Possible responses to deaths of US soldiers pose challenge for Washington,Zhao Yusha,2024-01-29,"The US has pledged to retaliate against the recent drone attack in Jordan that resulted in the deaths of three US soldiers and left more than 30 injured. However, determining the form of response presents a challenge to Washington. An excessive reaction risks entangling the US further in the complex Middle East crisis, while a weak response may undermine its global standing and appear embarrassing, said China experts, noting that a continued US presence in the region will only bring the country closer to a real war.Three US soldiers were killed and more than 30 injured in the drone attack on a US base near Jordan's border with Syria. Scores of US personnel have been wounded, including some with traumatic brain injuries, during the attack. After the incident, US President Joe Biden claimed the attack was carried out by ""radical Iran-backed militant groups."" He vowed ""We shall respond,"" AP reported. However, in a statement on Monday, Iran's mission to the UN said that Tehran was not involved in the attack that killed the US service members, media reported.The mission said, ""Iran had no connection and had nothing to do with the attack on the US base… There is a conflict between US forces and resistance groups in the region, which reciprocate retaliatory attacks."" It is the first time that a strike has killed US soldiers in the region since the Palestine-Israel conflict broke out in October 2023. A US official was quoted by the Telegraph as saying that the drone strike on US troops was ""the most deadly attack since October 17,"" when attacks on US personnel in the region began, and ""clearly an escalation of significance,"" adding that the Pentagon had launched an immediate investigation into how US air defenses did not repel the strike.Headache for the US China experts questioned whether the retaliatory action will be confined to the militant groups that the White House has blamed for the attack, or widened to Iran, the country the US has accused of supporting those militant groups.The US must target different militia groups in the region if it decides to carry out retaliatory attacks against militant groups, as the identity of the culprits behind the assault on US troops remains uncertain, professor of the School of International Studies and a senior researcher of the School of Global and Area Studies at Renmin University of China, told the Global Times on Monday. Tian further noted that the US may find itself trapped in a similar quagmire in the Middle East as it did following the 9/11 attacks.In fact, the US is now in a bind as to what form its response will take. Engaging in excessive attacks on the militants or resorting to retaliatory measures against Iran would only serve to entangle the US further in the web of the Middle East crisis, a nightmare that the country is keen to avoid repeating. Conversely, a feeble response would risk tarnishing Washington's image, leaving it vulnerable to accusations of embarrassment and weakness on the global stage, Liu Zhongmin, a professor at the Middle East Studies Institute of Shanghai International Studies University, told the Global Times on Monday. Liu said that the US is facing growing pressure as the Palestinian-Israeli Conflict drags on, thus the US dilemma of choosing how to respond to the recent attack reflects the contradiction in its Middle East strategy of engagement and withdrawal.According to experts, the US' involvement in the Middle East appears increasingly perilous, even if it were to overlook this particular attack. The potential sinking of a US warship by militant factions in the region would not only pose a severe challenge to Washington's image, credibility, and hegemony but also bring the country closer to the brink of war, cautioned Liu.Yemen's Houthis launched a rocket at US warship Lewis B. Puller as it sailed through the Gulf of Aden on Sunday, the group's military spokesman said in a statement on Monday.Back home, Joe Biden is also under mounting pressure to ratchet up the scale of his response. Republican in Congress said the administration's approach had failed to deter America's adversaries in the region. ""We need a major reset of our Middle East policy to protect our national security interests,"" said Republican Representative Michael McCaul of Texas, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, AP reported. Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina went further, urging the administration ""to strike targets of significance inside Iran, not only as reprisal for the killing of our forces, but as deterrence against future aggression. The only thing the Iran regime understands is force.""Liu said this loss and the fermenting chaos across the Middle East is becoming increasingly unfavorable for Joe Biden as the presidential election looms closer.Reaching outAs the US finds that handling the Middle East crisis is getting thornier by the day, it is now seeking China's help to assuage the conflict in the Red Sea, as Yemen's Houthi armed group continues attacking ships in the region. Wang Yi, a member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, held a new round of talks with US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan from Friday and Saturday in Thailand. According to a readout issued by the China Foreign Ministry, the two talked about not only bilateral relations, but also regional and international issues, including the Middle East, Ukraine, the Korean Peninsula and the South China Sea.After the meeting, a number of US media outlets reported that the US failed to prod China into pressuring Iran to stop Houthi attacks on commercial shipping in the Red Sea.The Joe Biden administration has been making the case to Beijing that it should help ""in terms of quieting some of those attacks, but whether it chooses to use that leverage in that way, I think that remains to be seen,"" a senior administration official told reporters during a call on Sullivan's meeting on Saturday, US media outlet Politico reported. Counting on China to pressure Iran to stop Houthi attacks is an overly simplistic notion, because China is not in a position to pressure Iran, and neither do the Houthi completely follow Iran's orders, said Liu. China has been making active efforts to ease tensions in the Red Sea from the very beginning, having called for an end to the attacks on civilian ships and urging relevant parties to avoid adding fuel to the tensions in the Red Sea, Wang Yi said in an interview with media after concluding his trip to Africa earlier this month.The US has displayed a perplexing contradiction in its approach toward China's involvement with Middle Eastern countries. While it has often viewed China's collaboration with these countries with a sense of envy, it now finds itself seeking China's assistance in resolving the ongoing crisis, said Liu, who added that the US should take a lesson from the Red Sea crisis and recognize the imperative nature of cooperating with China on Middle East issues.",CHINA,DIPLOMACY,The attacked base was named by US officials as Tower 22.

People carry the sacks and different items near the heavily damaged cars after Israel tanks hit UN (UN) headquarters building in Khan Yunis, Gaza on January 26, 2024. As a result of the Israel army's tank fire, the building and its surroundings were severely damaged. Photo: VCGFollowing the announcements of US and Canada, Italy, the UK, Finland, Australia and the Netherlands, Germany also announced the suspension of financial assistance to the UN (UN). Experts said on Sunday that the humanitarian issues such as refugee relief brought about by the Palestinian-Israeli Conflict conflict are anticipated to become even more complex, posing a greater challenge to the authority of the UN (UN).At least eight countries have paused future funding to the UN in the Near East amid an investigation into allegations that some workers of the UN agency participated in the October 7 attack on Israel in 2023.A senior Palestine official on Saturday urged countries that have announced the suspension of support for UN to reconsider their decisions to avoid political and humanitarian risks, according to the Xinhua. On Saturday, UN Commissioner-General Philippe Lazzarini said the funding pause from countries that accounts for much of its budget will serve to exacerbate the region's humanitarian crisis, fueled by the cutting-off of fuel and supplies.""It is shocking to see a suspension of funds to the Agency in reaction to allegations against a small group of staff, especially given the immediate action that UN took by terminating their contracts and asking for a transparent independent investigation,"" Lazzarini said in a statement.China experts said that since the outbreak of the latest Palestinian-Israeli Conflict conflict, UN operations have encountered significant difficulties. Its difficulties in terms of funding, security and personnel will further exacerbate the humanitarian crisis in Gaza and the living difficulties in the West Bank, Liu Zhongmin, a professor at the Middle East Studies Institute of Shanghai International Studies University, told the Global Times on Sunday.Additionally, humanitarian issues such as refugee relief are anticipated to become even more complex, posing a greater challenge to the authority of the UN, Liu said.The UN, established in 1949 as a subsidiary organ of the UN, serves to support the relief and human development of Palestine refugees and is entrusted with the mission of providing humanitarian assistance and protection to registered Palestine refugees in the agency's operational areas until a just and lasting solution to their plight is achieved.UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has pledged to conduct an ""urgent and comprehensive independent review of UN"" in the aftermath of Israel's allegations.At least 26,422 Palestine have been killed and 65,087 injured in Israel strikes on Gaza since October 7, 2023, Reuters reported, citing the Gaza Health Ministry in a statement on Sunday.",WORLD,CROSS-BORDERS,"Palestinian refugees from Khan Younis are evacuated to Rafah city in the southern Gaza Strip on January 27, 2024.

106,"China-EU economic ties highlighted for mutual benefit, should not be ‘hijacked’ by Lithuania's missteps: experts",GT staff reporters,2024-01-28," The EU has reportedly suspended its complaint at the WTO against China over so-called economic coercion of Lithuania, citing ""technical reasons."" China experts on Sunday stressed that China-EU economic ties are mutually beneficial, and the EU should commit to maintaining the healthy development of the ties, which should not be ""hijacked"" by Lithuania's missteps.Citing EU trade spokesman Olof Gill, the South China Morning Post reported that ""this is a procedural step taken for technical reasons related to the need to assess certain elements arising from the preparation of written submissions."" The suspension will be for an ""indeterminate period of time,"" but the bloc has one year to resume the dispute, according to the report.In January 2022, the EU filed a complaint with the WTO, accusing China of engaging in discriminatory trade practices against its eastern member Lithuania. China has always abided by the rules of the WTO, and this is beyond discussion, experts said, noting that it was Lithuania's wrongdoings on Taiwan-related questions that seriously affected the confidence of enterprises in the two countries to carry out normal cooperation.Before the EU filed the case, Lithuania consistently positioned itself on the anti-China front and breached the one-China principle by allowing the establishment of a ""representative office"" under the name of ""Taiwanese"" in Vilnius.China's so-called coercion of Lithuania is groundless and distorts the facts, a spokesperson for the China Foreign Ministry responded in January 2022, reminding the EU to tell right from wrong, stay wary of Lithuania's attempts to take China-EU relations hostage and advise Lithuania to follow other EU members in fulfilling the political commitment made upon the establishment of diplomatic ties with the People's Republic of China.The EU filing a complaint at WTO was more of taking a political stance, Hu Qimu, a deputy secretary-general of the digital-real economies integration Forum 50, told the Global Times on Sunday.In returning to real economic and trade issues, the EU, overall, is in greater need of China's colossal market, Hu said.The EU economy is under significant pressure due to the intense upheavals in the energy market caused by the Ukraine crisis and the Israel-Palestine conflict. Moreover, US interest rate hikes and reshoring initiatives in manufacturing have highly unfavorable effects on both the economic growth and industrial development of EU members, Hu noted.Against this backdrop, the EU must take responsibility for its own economy, rather than allowing itself to be ""hijacked"" by Lithuania, potentially causing harm to its own interests in the end, Hu said.""Looking at the broader picture of China-EU relations, there are no fundamental strategic differences or conflicts. Instead, there exists a wide range of shared interests and a foundation for long-term cooperation built over time,"" he added.According to a survey released by the EU Chamber of Commerce in China in September 2023, EU enterprises still attached great importance to the China market, and 63 percent hoped to continue to expand their market in China.This year marks the 60th anniversary of the establishment of China-France diplomatic relations, providing a favorable time for China and the EU to strengthen their mutually beneficial economic and trade ties. ""The EU should commit to maintaining the positive development of this relationship, which is crucial for the growth of both sides and the overall global economy,"" Hu said.",SOURCE,ECONOMY,China EU Photo:VCG,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'EU': ('ORG', 13), 'WTO': ('ORG', 4), 'South China Morning Post': ('ORG', 1), 'Foreign Ministry': ('ORG', 1), 'Forum': ('ORG', 1), 'Lithuania': ('LOC', 8), 'Vilnius': ('LOC', 1), ""People ' s Republic of China"": ('LOC', 12), 'Ukraine': ('LOC', 1), 'Israel': ('LOC', 1), 'Palestine': ('LOC', 1), 'US': ('LOC', 1), 'Olof Gill': ('PER', 1), 'Taiwan': ('MISC', 1), 'anti': ('MISC', 1), 'one': ('MISC', 1), 'Taiwanese': ('MISC', 1)}"
107,US failure in ‘having it both ways’ in Middle East demonstrates unappealing ‘leadership’,Xia Wenxin,2024-01-27,"The US has shown a biased approach to dealing with the Palestine-Israel conflict, and its failure to address the symptoms of the Red Sea crisis led to the current stalemate in the region. Against this backdrop, it wants to prove its leadership to the world, but it can lead nobody through the way it presents now.A New York Times opinion piece on Friday claimed that regarding the ongoing Red Sea crisis, ""Beijing is playing a cynical game, free-riding on the same US power that it holds in contempt, trying to have it both ways."" It clearly aimed to portray a situation in which an ""irresponsible"" China has to rely on the powerful US in order to safeguard its trade through the Red Sea.""China's seeming indifference to the Red Sea crisis reinforces the US' role as the world's predominant power, and demonstrates that China's capabilities and strategic objectives beyond its own region remain narrow and dependent on America's global leadership,"" the article concluded.However, it is exactly through the Red Sea crisis that all can see US global leadership is losing its luster. US allies are reluctant to aid Washington's efforts to build a 10-nation naval coalition to patrol the Red Sea, with only two countries - the UK and Greece - having actually deployed warships to the region. Countries like France, Italy and Spain have distanced themselves from directly participating in this coalition. This is not a good sign for a country attempting to preserve its image as a global leader.In terms of dealing with issues with the Middle East, it seems Washington itself is increasingly out of its depth and needs more help to manage its current dilemma. Yet, its ""global leadership"" in this crisis lost its appeal to the world, as most countries don't back its so-called leadership that, in fact, could result in chaos, conflicts and humanitarian disasters on a greater scale in the region.Recently, the US has even attempted to drag China into the Red Sea crisis by asking Beijing to urge Tehran to rein in the pro-Iran Houthi militants. On the Red Sea issue, China unquestionably supports all efforts that are conducive to peace in the region. It is trying to put out the fire by doing what it needs to do within the reach of its influence. But the resolution to the problems in the Middle East requires combining the strength of many if not all members of the global community. As the US fans the flames and seeks to escalate the conflict, the outlook for a resolution to the Middle East issues is likely to continue to dim.Washington needs to see the key to the loss of its appeal as a global leader lies in its desire to ""have it both ways"": It wants to side with its ally Israel in the Gaza conflict and solve the Red Sea crisis simultaneously, which is an untenable position, experts told the Global Times.Since the Red Sea crisis began to unfold, the US has cut it off from the Gaza conflict. But in a way, it detracts from the essence and context of the ongoing circumstances. Niu Xinchun, a research fellow at the China Institute of Contemporary International Relations, told the Global Times that the Red Sea crisis was caused by the Gaza conflict, since the Houthis wanted to exert pressure on Israel.""It is believed that the root cause of the problem is still the Gaza conflict, in which the US and Israel bear an important responsibility,"" said the China expert.As the world's No.1 maritime power, Washington believes that its military actions is working to safeguard the freedom of navigation that the Houthis are undermining. But in reality, what Washington really wants is to protect the shipping, especially that of weapons, to Israel. In that sense, the US is still adding fuel to the fire in the region.Moreover, after the US began its military operations in the Red Sea, especially after the attacks on the Houthis, the crisis has only become more acute. This proves that the US can't solve the problem by launching forceful strikes, but instead it is intensifying it.What the US refers to as global leadership is actually global hegemony that has only worsened global insecurity. It is the root cause of turmoil and conflict around the world, including those in the Middle East. But the affairs in the region should be governed by regional countries, not by Washington. It is hoped that US global hegemony will soon come to an end not only in the Middle East, but also across the globe.The author is a reporter with the Global Times. xiawenxin@globalitmes.com.cn",OPINION,VIEWPOINT,Illustration: Liu Rui/GT,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'US': ('LOC', 8), 'Palestine': ('LOC', 1), 'Israel': ('LOC', 1), 'Red Sea': ('LOC', 8), 'Beijing': ('LOC', 2), 'China': ('LOC', 5), 'America': ('LOC', 1), 'Washington': ('LOC', 2), 'UK': ('LOC', 1), 'Greece': ('LOC', 1), 'France': ('LOC', 1), 'Italy': ('LOC', 1), 'Spain': ('LOC', 1), 'Middle East': ('LOC', 2), 'Tehran': ('LOC', 1), 'Iran': ('LOC', 1), 'New York Times': ('ORG', 1)}"
108,"If US needs China in Red Sea, it should talk to China nicely: Global Times editorial",Global Times,2024-01-26,"West media recently reported that the US has asked China to urge Tehran to rein in the pro-Iran Houthi militants, which are attacking commercial ships in the Red Sea, but has seen little sign of help from Beijing. Media reports say the US has repeatedly raised the matter with top China officials in the past three months. The timing of the news is interesting, as the US has been organizing allied armed escorts in the Red Sea for over a month and conducting military strikes against the Houthi armed group for over two weeks, with little effect in terms of containment. The setback the US faces in the Red Sea coincides almost simultaneously with its pressure on China in public opinion, raising doubts about US' true intentions.The Red Sea is an important international trade route for goods and energy. The tense situation in the Red Sea harms the common interests of countries worldwide. Since the outbreak of the Red Sea crisis, China has maintained close communication with all parties involved to ease tensions and has made proactive efforts. China has consistently called for an end to the attacks on civilian vessels and urged relevant parties to avoid exacerbating the tense situation in the Red Sea, in order to jointly safeguard the security of the Red Sea waterway. If the US wishes to cooperate with China to jointly promote a peaceful resolution of the Red Sea crisis, its message would be better received without irritable or ambiguous undertones. It is also absurd to complain about China's actions in this matter.The US has always paid special attention to China's relationship with Iran, but most of the time, it views the ties through biased lens. Normal cooperation between China and Iran has constantly been demonized by the US, and normal economic and trade exchanges have repeatedly faced Washington's sanctions under the ""long-arm jurisdiction,"" as if any contact between China and Iran is viewed unfavorably by the US. However, since the recent escalation of the Israel-Palestine conflict, US officials have repeatedly asked China to leverage this relationship and exert ""influence"" on Iran. If they believe the expected results are not achieved, they even criticize China. This obvious contradiction is a perfect portrayal of US' selfishness and double standards on the international stage.The US is driven by a sense of urgency, so it presented inconsistent images, urging China to increase mediation efforts. The recent US airstrikes against Houthi forces have not yielded the expected results, and attacks on commercial ships have not diminished. Several West media outlets have commented that military strikes will only backfire. Pentagon officials also admitted that the military campaign against the Houthi forces is not working. The envisioned image of the ""Guardians of Prosperity"" by the US in launching escort operations has turned into emptiness, leaving behind a figure increasingly passive and struggling to cope in the Red Sea.It is not surprising that the US finds itself in such a situation because it either fails or refuses to recognize the root cause of the Red Sea crisis. While Houthi forces are responsible for harassing civilian ships, the crisis stems from the overflow of the Gaza conflict. All parties need to return to the core issue of achieving an immediate ceasefire and implementing the ""two-state solution"" for the Palestinian-Israeli Conflict. If the US does not grasp this point and continues to intensify military strikes against the Red Sea stakeholders, the result will only be to perpetuate a cycle of escalating violence. Moreover, concerning the core issue of the Gaza conflict, the US has yet to demonstrate a sincere stance toward peace and dialogue, contributing to the escalating tensions in the Red Sea region.Since the Russia-Ukraine conflict, the US has consistently sought to bring China into its strategic agenda in almost every major geopolitical conflict, hyping the ""China responsibility"" theory. On issues that are beneficial to both countries and the world, China never refuses to cooperate with the US. On the contrary, China often takes the initiative to fulfill its responsibilities through collaboration. The US' complaints in this regard are largely an attempt to shift the responsibility for regional crises onto China, reflecting a habit by the US in recent years when it has misjudged or has been ineffective in dealing with regional crises.The US has long been concerned about China filling the so-called ""power vacuum"" it left in the Middle East. Consequently, it consistently demonizes normal cooperation between China and regional countries, seeking to counterbalance China's ""influence"" in the region. The current facts further prove that China firmly supports regional countries in resolving regional hotspot issues through political means. China supports mutually beneficial and win-win development between regional countries and itself. This approach is more appealing than the US' practice of creating ""exclusive circles"" and playing off one faction against another in the region. It genuinely contributes to achieving peace and stability in the region.",OPINION,EDITORIAL,"A ship transits the Suez Canal towards the Red Sea on January 10, 2024 in Ismailia, Egypt.

112,"Mischief of slandering China’s economy will fail, as it should: Sachs",Global Times,2024-01-25,"Editor's Note: Despite facing a complex international situation and multiple headwinds, China's economy expanded by 5.2 percent in 2023, surpassing the target. However, a new wave of very negative narratives about China's economy has emerged in the West media lately, attempting to undermine investors' confidence in China's future. To counter West media's malicious distortions  that clearly deviates from the real state of the China economy, the Global Times (Global Times) invited Jeffrey Sachs (Sachs), a world-renowned US economist, to provide his perspectives. Global Times: How do you view the 5.2 percent growth of China's economy in 2023, the first year of the post-COVID recovery amid global gloom?Sachs: This is a very respectable performance. US growth was about 2.5 percent. Remember too that the US population is growing about 0.5 percent per year, while population growth in China is essentially zero, so China's growth advantage is even greater when expressed in per capita terms.  Global Times: Mainstream US media and well-known economists criticized the performance of the China economy in 2023 as being ""weak."" Many headlines claimed that the ""China economy encountered trouble and various indicators fell short of expectations."" What is your perspective on that?Sachs: The US government is actively trying to slow the China economy through erecting trade and technology barriers. The US has put up barriers to China's exports to the US through both formal means such as tariffs and informal arm-twisting of US companies. The US has also introduced technology and investment barriers.  The US government and therefore the mainstream media are promoting the view that China's economy is in trouble. This is a bit of an echo chamber. One reporter close to the government writes it, and then other reporters repeat the same exaggerated story. They don't know much about China or about the deep strengths of China's economy, including major advances in technology, global export competitiveness, and high saving and investment rates.  US attempts to weaken the China economy may have some modest short-run consequences (mainly slower export growth by China companies and modest displacements of investments from China into ASEAN countries) but the adverse effects will not be large, in my view. The US government's mischief will fail, as it should.  Global Times: There were many new bright spots in China's economy in 2023. Exports of the ""new three items"" - electric vehicles (EVs), lithium batteries and solar cells - for the first time exceeded the 1 trillion yuan ($140 billion) mark. China became the largest EV exporter in 2023. How do you view these new growth engines?Sachs: China is the world's low-cost producer of most green and digital technologies, such as EVs, photovoltaic systems and 5G equipment. This will put China in a strong global position for the coming decade, since the world needs to make a major energy transition and China will be a key provider of the new low-carbon infrastructure, connectivity and appliances.   Global Times: China's economic work is increasingly focused on expanding domestic demand. How do you view the advantages of China's large home market, and what suggestions do you have for fully tapping the potential of domestic market in China?Sachs: I believe that China should still strive for export-led growth, but now more to the emerging market economies (BRICS, African Union, Latin America, West Asia, Central Asia) than to the US or the EU. China should be the key provider for the green and digital transformation of the world's emerging economies. This will be good for China, for China's trade partners and for global environmental protection. The BRI (BRI) remains very important in this regard. China should continue to champion the BRI as a very important initiative for global transformation, global growth and China's economic growth.  Global Times: What do you believe will be the key driving factors for China's economy in 2024?Sachs: The key factors will be China's successful promotion of global growth in the emerging/BRICS economies, as well as China's continued dynamism in technological advancement - in artificial intelligence, semiconductors, zero-carbon energy, battery technology, precision medicine, precision agriculture, low-carbon transport (shipping and  aviation), high-speed rail and other areas.  Global Times: How do you evaluate the current economic situation of China? How do you view China's economic prospects in 2024? Which areas do you think offer the greatest opportunities?Sachs: As I've said, I believe that China's growth will be quality-based, mainly through technological upgrading, digital applications and the green transformation. This will happen within China and also between China and its major trading partners in Asia, Africa and Latin America. Of course, I hope that the US stops its trade war with China, which violates the WTO and is bad for the US and unhelpful for China.  Global Times: Global growth is projected to slow for the third year in a row - from 2.6 percent last year to 2.4 percent in 2024, the World Bank said. In a world battling economic uncertainties, how should major economies jointly tackle challenges and promote global growth rather than politicizing economic issues?Sachs: The main solutions to the world economy are to stop the wars in Ukraine and the Middle East, reduce trade tensions between the West and China, and cooperate on building an efficient digital, green global economy. All of this is possible through diplomacy. The US should stop immediately trying to expand NATO to Ukraine, thereby ending the war in Ukraine. The US should stop arming Israel, thereby ending the war in the Middle East. And the US should abide by agreements with China regarding the Taiwan island, so as to reduce the tensions over Taiwan.  In the 1982 US-China Communique, the US promised to phase out arms sales to Taiwan. The US should honor its agreements, leading to peaceful relations and a reduction of tension.     Global Times: How do you view the global significance of the steady and positive development of China's economy?Sachs: China's economic progress has been extraordinarily positive for the China people and very good for the world. Economic progress anywhere, including in China, is a win-win proposition for the world. The US mistakenly thinks that the world economy is a ""zero-sum"" struggle, in which China's progress is somehow bad for the US.  This is a badly mistaken view.",SOURCE,ECONOMY,"A bustling scene at the container terminal of Zhangjiagang Port in East China's Jiangsu Province, on January 23, 2024 Photo: VCG",Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'China': ('LOC', 18), 'West': ('LOC', 2), 'US': ('LOC', 12), 'Global Times': ('ORG', 3), 'ASEA': ('ORG', 1), 'Jeffrey Sachs': ('PER', 4), 'CO': ('MISC', 1), 'Times': ('MISC', 1)}"
113,Assisting Africa’s security and development needs does not have to be a football match,Andrey Kortunov,2024-01-25," Just over a year ago, at the US-Africa leaders' summit in Washington in December 2022, President Joe Biden made a public commitment to pay a visit to the Cradle of Humankind. However, he is unlikely to keep his promise, at least not before the US presidential elections in November. Still, Africa already had a lot of the US' attention: a long chain of top-level US officials showed up here over 2023, including Vice President Kamala Harris, Defense Secretary Lloyd J. Austin III and first lady Jill Joe Biden.Finally, earlier this week, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken kicked off a tour across West Africa visiting four countries - Cabo Verde, Cote d'Ivoire, Nigeria and Angola. This was not Blinken's first appearance in this corner of the world. Since 2021, he had already made three trips to Sub-Saharan Africa. Nonetheless, in the last ten months, there was a notable pause in his African journeys. Arguably, this was due to the ongoing Israel-Palestine conflict that consumed most of his time and energy.One explanation for the elevated attention Africa has received from the US lies in global geopolitics. The US should be seriously concerned about the eroding West influence in many places in Africa. It is sufficient to mention that since 2020, there have been eight regime changes in the continent, with many African countries shifting away from their former West partners to China and to Russia. These days, Beijing funds most of the large-scale African infrastructure development projects, and Moscow is getting more and more involved in providing security for a growing number of African countries. Not surprisingly, most of these countries prefer not to join the Ukraine-related sanctions against Russia led by the US and EU or to take the US side in the US-China economic standoff.For a long time, the US geopolitical engagement in Africa was relatively modest - at least, compared to EU, East Asia or the Middle East. Traditionally Washington relied on its EU allies to keep a close eye on potentially worrisome African developments and to contain them appropriately. It now seems that EU allies fell short of US expectations. France might be the most graphic example - it rapidly lost its former hegemony in former France colonies. The United Kingdom, which is still struggling with Brexit's repercussions and explicitly tilting toward the Asia-Pacific, is experiencing a less dramatic, but still visible shrinking of its former impressive African portfolio.  In sum, it might be the right time for Uncle Sam to enter the African scene in a more prominent way than it has done earlier. True, the US military presence in Africa has already been expanding in recent years, especially with the establishment of the Africa Command (AFRICOM) in 2007 as the defense department's regional combatant command for Africa. Still, many critics argue that this presence so far has done little to contribute to security on the continent or to promote specific US interests here.The big question, however, is simple: except for speaking softly and carrying a big stick, what exactly can Uncle Sam offer its African counterparts and potential partners? US trade with Africa has been at best stagnating for at least the past twenty years and it now makes less than 2 percent of the total US foreign trade. The overall value of US exports to the continent fell from $32.9 billion in 2011 to $26.7 billion in 2021, while imports declined from $93 billion in 2011 to $37.6 billion in 2021. It is about a quarter of China's overall trade with Africa. Furthermore, US trade with Africa is far less diverse than China's trade - both in terms of its geography and its structure.US foreign direct investments (FDI) to Africa demonstrate a similar underperformance. China surpassed the US in overall FDI to African countries back in 2013 and since then, the gap between the two has been steadily widening. It is somewhat symbolic that Antony Blinken who was invited to Cote d'Ivoire to attend a knockout game at the African Cup of Nations between the Ivorian hosts and Equatorial Guinea, was enjoying the football match from a 60,000-seat stadium built with support from China, whose foreign minister, Wang Yi, visited Cote d'Ivoire just a few days prior to Blinken's visit.Nobody could expect the US to outclass China or Russia in every single African country in every single area. Nobody should look at the US international leadership as a hostage to Washington's ability or inability to restore its benevolent or malevolent hegemony in Africa. International competition for projects, contracts and influence is not something entirely wrong, but assisting the continent's security and development needs does not have to be a football match. The reality is that Africa is big enough to accommodate everybody - its needs are incredibly huge and its prospects are truly breathtaking. In years to come, the continent will present both some of the most dangerous challenges and many of the most spectacular opportunities for those willing to engage with Africa. To the extent possible, one should try to exempt Africa from the ongoing geopolitical competition between overseas great powers. The Cradle of Humankind should rather become a global lab for innovative models of multilateral cooperation, which will ultimately benefit us all. The author is the academic director of the Russia International Affairs Council. opinion@globaltimes.com.cn",OPINION,VIEWPOINT,Illustration: Chen Xia/Global Times,Author title not found,"Andrey Kortunov, academic director of the Russian International Affairs Council.","{'US': ('LOC', 12), 'Washington': ('LOC', 2), 'Cradle of Humankind': ('LOC', 1), 'West Africa': ('LOC', 7), 'Cabo Verde': ('LOC', 1), ""Cote d ' Ivoire"": ('LOC', 1), 'Nigeria': ('LOC', 1), 'Angola': ('LOC', 1), 'Israel': ('LOC', 1), 'Palestine': ('LOC', 1), 'China': ('LOC', 2), 'Russia': ('LOC', 2), 'Beijing': ('LOC', 1), 'Moscow': ('LOC', 1), 'East Asia': ('LOC', 2), 'Middle East': ('LOC', 1), 'France': ('LOC', 2), 'United Kingdom': ('LOC', 1), 'Pacific': ('LOC', 1), 'Joe Biden': ('PER', 1), 'Kamala Harris': ('PER', 1), 'Lloyd J.

116,"China’s rise is a matter of concern for US, but not a problem for France",Global Times,2024-01-24,"Editor's Note:This year marks the 60th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and France, the two countries have witnessed not only tremendous development in bilateral ties, but also great changes in the global landscape. How will the tension between the US and China affect the development of France itself and China-France cooperation? What does France's emphasis on strategic autonomy mean for China-France and China-EU relations? Pascal Boniface (Boniface), the founding Director of the France Institute for International and Strategic Affairs, shared his insights with Global Times (Global Times) reporter Wang Zixuan. Global Times: How do you evaluate the development of China-France exchanges over the past 60 years? What do you think is the most prominent achievement?Boniface: It's a long way and a historic progress for France and China. There are many changes. Of course, France is not what it used to be in 1964, but we are more or less the same kind of country, while China is totally different from that time.There are different steps in our cooperation. In the beginning, France was allied with the US, nevertheless, we have decided to be independent, not to rely on the US for our own security. Meanwhile, given the big differences in economic and political systems, China and France have decided to work together to enlarge our room to maneuver. China is now the second biggest economy in the world, and maybe it could be No.1 in a few years. But the desire to cooperate, though there is a difference in political systems, is still the basis of our relationship. So sometimes we are partners, sometimes we could be rivals, but we have both accepted our differences.Global Times: In April last year, France President Emmanuel Macron tweeted about his trip to China on social media, saying that ""there is so much for us to do together."" What does he mean by saying ""so much for us to do?"" Which fields are promising in our future cooperation? Boniface: We have many fields that we could cooperate in, for example, both China and France are fighting against climate change. It's a priority for our two countries. Therefore, we have been working together since the Paris Agreement in 2015. We also called for common interest to contribute to African development. Meanwhile, we are also coming into other peaceful settlements of conflict and working together at the UN to try to find a solution to the most important conflicts, both in Gaza and between Russia and Ukraine. France and China have differences, but we have decided to keep in contact and try to find a common solution. And France doesn't want to follow the US policy against China. France is reluctant to include China in the NATO agenda. As President Macron once said, NATO is an organization that concerns the North Atlantic, China has little to do with the North Atlantic. Both France and EU have to set freely and independently their own policies toward China and not follow blindly Washington's policy.Global Times: President Macron recently announced France's decision not to join the US-UK joint strikes on Houthi sites in Yemen. You once said that the alliance with the US makes it difficult for France to back down, as history has proven many times. And that ""the time when EU just obeys the US is over. Europeans must define their own policy by themselves."" How do you see the prospects for France and EU strategic autonomy? To what extent can France and even EU get rid of dependence on the US?Boniface: To be frank, it is true that since the beginning of the war between Russia and Ukraine, it has been much more difficult to plead for EU strategic autonomy.EU countries want to stick to NATO policy, so for the time being the EU society is brain dead but this could change again, notably if Donald Trump is elected in November. But regarding the specific issue of the Houthis and the strikes on Yemen, France considers that it's not a good solution, and it could only widen the problem, because the Houthis won't be deterred by the US and the UK's strikes. They will react even more strongly. So we will agree to provide a protective shelter over the boats that pass through the Red Sea, but not to make strikes on Yemen, otherwise, the situation will deteriorate.Global Times: How do you see the possibility of a cease-fire between Russia and Ukraine in 2024? EU is considered to be the biggest victim of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, how much will it affect EU if it continues? How can China and France cooperate in promoting a cease-fire?Boniface: Honestly, these goals are desirable, but they are just impossible to reach. Maybe in a couple of months, the situation will change. The West countries can give military help to Ukraine, but they don't want to send troops. Global Times: How will the tension between the US and China affect the development of France itself and China-France cooperation? What does France's emphasis on strategic autonomy mean for China-France and China-EU relations?Boniface: The France position is that there is a worry between China and the US. In fact, the main reason is not the difference of regime, but China's rise. So it's a matter of concern for the US, but it's not a problem for France. When I began to work on strategic issues in the 1980s, France was richer than China, and now it's the contrary. But this doesn't hinder the establishment of good relations. We are not fighting for world supremacy. Between the US and China, there is a rivalry for being the No.1 in the world. Therefore, the US perspective and the France perspective are not the same.Global Times: You have also mentioned that France should not transform China into a systemic enemy. Why did you say that? Currently, there are various versions of the ""China threat"" theory in EU, such as the threat of China's electric vehicles, the threat of China's wind power, etc. Which forces are hyping the ""China threat"" and pushing to turn China into an enemy?Boniface: China is a friend, it's also an economic competitor. We have an unbalance in trade between our two countries. Therefore, its market must be more open. If we have a strong economic exchange with China, many France producers are happy to have access to the China market. China could be a rival, could be a competitor, but ''enemy'' is not the correct word to describe China.Wu Bowei contributed to this interview.",OPINION,VIEWPOINT,Illustration: Xia Qing/Global Times,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'China': ('LOC', 12), 'France': ('LOC', 12), 'US': ('LOC', 3), 'Paris': ('LOC', 1), 'Gaza': ('LOC', 1), 'Russia': ('LOC', 1), 'EU': ('ORG', 1), 'France Institute for International and Strategic Affairs': ('ORG', 1), 'Global Times': ('ORG', 4), 'UN': ('ORG', 1), 'Pascal Boniface': ('PER', 3), 'Wang Zixuan': ('PER', 1), 'Emmanuel Macron': ('PER', 1), 'Bon': ('PER', 1), 'Times': ('MISC', 1), 'African': ('MISC', 1)}"
117,"Without effective intl mediation, regional hotspots likely to spill over in Middle East",Wang Jin,2024-01-23," The recent local conflict in the Middle East is flaring up. Iran launched attacks on Israel's Mossad spy agency in Iraq on Monday. On Thursday, suspected Jordanian air strikes on Syria have triggered widespread concern among neighboring countries. Israel has launched attacks on targets in Lebanon and Syria. Amid the ongoing Israel-Palestine conflict and the escalation of the Red Sea crisis, the Middle East seems to be on the eve of a wider war.After more than 100 days of conflict, the Israel economy has been severely affected. Israel's need for arms has tremendously increased, especially for critical military equipment, such as precision-guided munitions and Iron Dome air defense missiles. Despite the calls for peace and an end to the war inside the country, the Israel government still believes that the military operation in Gaza must be pushed ahead.Recently, the US and the UK have been carrying out strikes on Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen. However, the military strikes have further intensified the strategic risk of the Red Sea. Last week, Yemeni Vice President Aidarus al-Zubaidi said that its military forces need foreign assistance to launch a ground operation against the Houthis.It can be said that the fragile peace that has just emerged in Yemen is likely to be replaced by the resurgence of war.In addition, Iran's recent attacks on targets in Iraq and Pakistan, and Jordan's suspected attacks on Syria, have been relatively limited in scale, and there is little likelihood of an escalating spillover of military operations.Against the backdrop that Pakistan missiles struck Iran in a retaliatory bombing on Thursday, Iran has not continued to demonstrate a tough stance. Iran and Pakistan announced on Monday that they seek to mend relations after recently swapping air strikes, making it clear that the two countries have no intention of escalating the conflict.As for the airstrikes in Syria, it is likely that they aimed to combat drug trafficking and production networks if they were indeed conducted by Jordan, a country that has been carrying out similar actions for many years to stop the inflow of those networks from southern Syria. Overall, the attacks, if conducted by Jordan, are a continuation of previous operations, and they only raised concerns internationally about the escalation of regional conflicts during a sensitive time like now. In contrast, Israel's military strikes on targets within Syria and Lebanon could potentially become the biggest uncertainty factor in the regional conflict.First, from Israel's perspective, Syria has become a ""hub"" for Iran and its Shiite militias. These groups, organized under the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) in Iran, are steadily approaching the Israel-Syria front, attempting to launch attacks against Israel. Additionally, Iran is targeting Mossad personnel operating abroad.In this context, Israel has conducted multiple cross-border strikes inside Syria in recent weeks, resulting in the deaths of several members of the IRGC, escalating tensions between Israel, Syria and Iran.Second, the clashes between Israel and Lebanon may escalate the regional conflict. In recent weeks, Israel and Hezbollah have continuously attacked each other, leading to fierce conflicts in the frontline areas. Moreover, Israel has conducted multiple cross-border strikes on key targets in Hezbollah-controlled areas, killing Hamas deputy chief Saleh Arouri and senior Hezbollah officer Wissam Tawil, intensifying concerns about the Israel-Lebanon front.Third, under domestic political pressure, Israel is likely to continue targeting senior Hamas figures hiding in Lebanon and Syria, while simultaneously using military means to ""deter"" Shiite militias within Syria territory. Due to the absence of Israel's diplomatic relations with Syria, Iran and Lebanon, as well as a lack of effective mediation channels, Israel's future military actions in Syria and Lebanon could potentially become the primary catalyst for escalating this round of regional conflict.The Israel-Palestine conflict, the Red Sea crisis and the recent cross-border military operations by various regional countries all indicate the spill-over effects of conflicts in the Middle East. Given the complex relationships among the conflicting parties in the region, the current tensions on the local level may likely evolve into a wider war in the future without effective international mediation. The author is an associate professor at Northwest University in China. opinion@globaltimes.com.cn",OPINION,VIEWPOINT,Illustration:Chen Xia/GT,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'Middle East': ('LOC', 2), 'Iran': ('LOC', 5), 'Israel': ('LOC', 8), 'Iraq': ('LOC', 2), 'Syria': ('LOC', 7), 'Lebanon': ('LOC', 2), 'Palestine': ('LOC', 1), 'Red Sea': ('LOC', 2), 'Gaza': ('LOC', 1), 'US': ('LOC', 1), 'UK': ('LOC', 1), 'Yemen': ('LOC', 2), 'Pakistan': ('LOC', 3), 'Jordan': ('LOC', 3), 'Mossad': ('ORG', 1), 'Houthis': ('ORG', 1), 'Jordanian': ('MISC', 1), 'Iron Dome': ('MISC', 1), 'Houthi': ('MISC', 1), 'Yemeni': ('MISC', 1), 'Aidarus al - Zubaidi': ('PER', 1)}"
119,"Blinken kicks off Africa trip, but US 'may be too overwhelmed with crises' to stabilize West Africa",Xu Yelu,2024-01-22,"  set off for a four-nation trip to Africa on Sunday. China experts said on Monday that the US may no longer have the capacity to stabilize West Africa, given the ongoing conflict in Ukraine and the escalating situation in the Middle East and Red Sea.According to his itinerary, Blinken will start his trip in Cape Verde before visiting the Cote d'Ivoire, Nigeria and Angola, his first trip to sub-Saharan Africa in 10 months as he takes a break from focusing on the Israel-Hamas war.US State Department spokesperson Matt Miller described the African nations as ""incredibly important countries that require US engagement.""Blinken is slated to discuss economic issues, as well as security, including the terrorist threat in the Sahel. He is also expected to discuss August's military coup in Niger, which overthrew the elected leader of one of America's top partners in the region, according to CNN.One purpose of Blinken's visit is to evaluate the implementation of the US-Africa Summit in December 2022 in African countries, as Nigeria is a key country for the US in Africa, and Angola is involved in the Lobito Corridor project, Shen Xiaolei, an associate research fellow at the China Academy of Social Sciences in Beijing, told the Global Times on Monday. Located in Central Africa, the Corridor proposes building a railway line connecting critical minerals mines in Zambia and the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) with the Lobito port in Angola.The second is to discuss the security situation in West Africa and the Sahel region. Currently, these two regions are the most severely affected by terrorism in Africa, the expert said.And the third purpose is to discuss the instability in the eastern part of the DRC, Shen noted. Angola is an important participant in the peace process in the eastern part of the DRC, and the US certainly wants to leverage Angola's influence.However, experts believed that given the escalating situation in the Middle East, particularly the worsening Red Sea crisis, the US no longer has the capability to stabilize West Africa. In fact, following military coups in Mali, Burkina Faso, and Niger, the three countries have withdrawn from the G5 Sahel alliance and formed their own Sahel National Alliance, driving France troops out of the Sahel region and engaging in military cooperation with Russia. All this indicates it's difficult for the US to stabilize West Africa. In addition, the US will certainly focus more on the Middle East and the Red Sea due to the turmoil there, and temporarily lacks the ability to pay attention to West Africa and the Sahel region.Blinken's visit to the region also comes days after China Foreign Minister Wang Yi wrapped up his tour through Africa, during which he also visited Cote d'Ivoire.In the current context of global power competition, the US has brought the competition among major powers to Africa, with China and Russia being its main targets, experts said. This has prompted some media outlets to suggest that Blinken's visit to Africa implies a lack of goodwill toward China and Russia. African development requires comprehensive cooperation with countries around the world, and as African countries gain more strategic autonomy, they have the ability to choose better cooperation partners and will not easily align themselves with any particular side, Shen noted.  If Blinken's trip to four African countries results in cooperation that meaningfully benefits the continent, we should welcome such outcomes, Shen said.",CHINA,DIPLOMACY,US Secretary of State Antony Blinken,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'China': ('LOC', 1), 'US': ('LOC', 7), 'West Africa': ('LOC', 8), 'Ukraine': ('LOC', 1), 'Middle East': ('LOC', 2), 'Red Sea': ('LOC', 2), 'Cape Verde': ('LOC', 1), ""Cote d ' Ivoire"": ('LOC', 1), 'Nigeria': ('LOC', 2), 'Angola': ('LOC', 5), 'Sahel': ('LOC', 5), 'Niger': ('LOC', 2), 'America': ('LOC', 1), 'Beijing': ('LOC', 1), 'Central Africa': ('LOC', 5), 'Zambia': ('LOC', 1), 'Democratic Republic of the Congo': ('LOC', 1), 'DRC': ('LOC', 3), 'Lobito': ('LOC', 1), 'Mali': ('LOC', 1), 'Burkina Faso': ('LOC', 1), 'G': ('LOC', 1), 'France': ('LOC', 1), 'Russia': ('LOC', 1), 'All': ('LOC', 1), 'Blinken': ('PER', 3), 'Matt Miller': ('PER', 1), 'Shen Xiaolei': ('PER', 2), 'sub': ('MISC', 1), 'Saharan': ('MISC', 1), 'Israel': ('MISC', 1), 'African': ('MISC', 2), 'US - Africa Summit': ('MISC', 1), 'Lobito Corridor': ('MISC', 1), 'National': ('MISC', 1), 'Hamas': ('ORG', 1), 'US State Department': ('ORG', 1), 'CNN': ('ORG', 1), 'China Academy of Social Sciences': ('ORG', 1), 'Global Times': ('ORG', 1), 'Corridor': ('ORG', 1), 'Alliance': ('ORG', 1)}"
121,China urges relevant parties to avoid adding fuel to Red Sea tension,Chen Qingqing,2024-01-21,"With global concerns rising over the prolonged Red Sea crisis, which not only causes a severe impact on shipping routes but also poses risks to the post-pandemic economic recovery, China has called for an end to attacks on civilian ships and urged the parties concerned to avoid adding fuel to the tensions in the Red Sea, as some China experts noted that US military actions are exacerbating the Red Sea crisis. China has been making active efforts to ease tensions in the Red Sea from the very beginning, having called for an end to the attacks on civilian ships and urged relevant parties to avoid adding fuel to the tensions in the Red Sea, China Foreign Minister Wang Yi said in an interview with the media after concluding his trip to Africa. During Wang's visit, discussions were held on addressing the spillover effects of the Gaza conflict, particularly on safeguarding the security of the Red Sea navigation channels, Wang said. China calls for an end to the harassment of civilian vessels, and urges relevant parties to avoid adding fuel to the fire, jointly safeguard the security of the sea lanes in accordance with the law, and earnestly respect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of countries bordering the Red Sea, including Yemen.The structure of the global benchmark Brent crude futures market and some physical markets in EU and Africa have been reflecting tighter supply partly over concerns about shipping delays as vessels have avoided or tried to avoid the Red Sea due to missile and drone attacks, Al Jazeera reported on Saturday. US Central Command forces struck a Houthi anti-ship missile prepared to launch and aimed at the Gulf of Aden on Saturday, Voice of America reported on Saturday. It was the US military's seventh strike against Houthi missile launchers in a week. The White House said the strikes are necessary to protect merchant ships and US Navy vessels in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden, according to the VOA. The Red Sea crisis is an international issue that affects global supply chains and the security of maritime trade routes, involving stakeholders from around the globe. Addressing the Red Sea crisis should not involve forming exclusive, small multilateral organizations with ""high walls"" but rather involve a collective effort to resolve the crisis, Sun Degang, director of the Center for Middle Eastern Studies at Fudan University, told the Global Times on Sunday. The root of the Red Sea crisis lies in the Palestine region. Without addressing this root cause, merely attempting to resolve the crisis in the Red Sea is likely insufficient, Sun noted. ""The motive behind the Houthi rebels intercepting commercial ships in the Red Sea is to strike against Israel, signaling the need for Israel to resolve the conflict and end the collective punishment of people in the Gaza.""Some experts noted that military means alone cannot resolve the Red Sea crisis. The frequent strikes by the US and West forces against the Houthi rebels actually lead to the rise of more anti-US forces, including the unification of forces like Iran, Hezbollah in Lebanon, and the Houthi rebels. ""This approach of meeting violence with violence only creates more conflicts and confrontations, escalating the crisis,"" Sun said. The spillover of the Palestinian-Israeli Conflict conflict is escalating in the directions of Syria, Lebanon and the Red Sea, presenting a coordinated uptick in tensions, Liu Zhongmin, a professor at the Middle East Studies Institute of Shanghai International Studies University, told the Global Times on Sunday. ""The conflict between the US and Israel and the Iran-led resistance front is intensifying, consequently elevating the risk of a direct confrontation between the US and Israel, and Iran,"" Liu said.  Although neither the US nor Iran desires to be drawn into a large-scale conflict or war, the current trajectory suggests an increasing risk of the US becoming further entangled in Middle Eastern conflicts, Liu noted. The Palestine issue remains at the core of the Middle East issue, touching on the peace and stability of the region and testing the moral conscience of humanity, Wang told the media. China firmly supports the just cause of the Palestine people in regaining their legitimate national rights and steadfastly supports the long-standing aspiration of the Palestine to establish an independent state, he said. However, Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has doubled down on opposition to an independent Palestine state, deepening the division between Israel and its allies including the US, as US President Joe Biden said on Friday that he spoke with Netanyahu about possible solutions for creating an independent Palestine state, according to media reports. ""Before a cease-fire in Gaza, it's impossible to launch any negotiations for a two-state solution. For Israel, the most urgent task now is to resolve the Gaza crisis,"" Liu said.",CHINA,DIPLOMACY,"A container ship sails in the Red Sea in the Straits of Tiran, in 2023.

122,China urges to avoid adding fuel to Red Sea tension,Global Times,2024-01-20,"China has been making active efforts to ease the tension in the Red Sea from the very beginning, calling for an end to the attacks on civilian ships and urging relevant parties to avoid adding fuel to the tension in the Red Sea, China Foreign Minister Wang Yi said in an interview with the media after concluding his trip to Africa. Wang also a member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, had recently concluded his visits to Egypt, Tunisia, Togo and Cote d'Ivoire from January 13 to 18.During his visit to Africa, Wang said he communicated and coordinated with the Saudi Arabia side on dealing with the spillover effects of the Gaza conflict, especially in maintaining the security of the Red Sea shipping route. ""We should jointly uphold the security on the sea lanes of the Red Sea in accordance with the law and also respect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the countries along the Red Sea coast, including Yemen,"" Wang said during the interview with China media on Friday.Additionally, Wang held in-depth communication with Egypt, Tunisia, and the League of Saudi Arabia States Secretary-General on the Palestine question. Wang said the Palestinian-Israeli Conflict conflict has been going on for over a hundred days, resulting in large-scale casualties among innocent civilians and a severe humanitarian crisis. China has actively advocated and strongly condemned all acts that harm civilians, opposed any practices that violate international law, and supported all efforts aimed at preventing the escalation of the conflict and promoting the restoration of peace. Saudi Arabia and Islamic countries highly appreciate China's position. The ordinary people we encountered on the streets also praised China's just stance and hoped that China would continue to promote a ceasefire and alleviate the humanitarian crisis, Wang noted. The China foreign minister underscored that the Palestine question has always been at the core of the Middle East issue, which is related to the peace and stability of the Middle East and challenges human moral conscience. China firmly supports the just cause of the Palestine people in restoring their legitimate national rights and firmly supports the long-cherished wish of the Palestine to achieve independent statehood.

It noted that in the six weeks since December 2023, the number of container ships passing through the Bab-el-Mandeb Strait has continuously declined. Compared to December 15, 2023, the number of container ships in the Red Sea has decreased by 70 percent, dealing a heavy blow to container shipping routes passing through the Red Sea in a short period of time.On Thursday, He Yadong, a spokesperson for the Ministry of Commerce said the ministry will keep track of the situation in Red Sea region in response to the escalation and will offer timely support to foreign trade enterprises.He called for all concerned parties to restore and guarantee shipping route security on the sea lanes of the Red Sea and guarantee the smooth flow of global production and supply chains as part of normal international trade.Answering a reported statement from a senior official of the Houthis who promised the safe passage of Russia and China ships through the Red Sea, Mao Ning, the spokesperson from China Foreign Ministry said on Friday that China has been calling for a halt to the harassment and attacks on civilian ships to keep global industrial and supply chains unimpeded and safeguard the international trade order.Mostly recently, Yemen's Houthi group on Friday claimed responsibility for carrying out a missile attack on a US ship in the Gulf of Aden, the Xinhua reported.The situation has remained tense since Houthi rebels in Yemen announced that they had hijacked and detained a ship with connections to Israel in November 2023. Over the following weeks, the situation escalated, leading to a decrease in the number of ships passing through the Bab-el-Mandeb Strait.""Currently, the crisis has led to a reduction in capacity, increased costs, and disrupted schedules on the Far East-EU container shipping route. If the crisis does not show signs of easing and is compounded by the China New Year factor, it may have a significant impact on global supply chain security,"" chinatimes.net.cn reported, citing a report by Elane.Major international shipping companies such as Maersk, MSC, Hapag-Lloyd, and ONE are expected to continue bypassing the region through the Cape of Good Hope for several months. The escalating crisis in the Red Sea is increasing the risk of shipping disruptions, according to prediction of Ningbo Shipping Exchange.The Ningbo Shipping Exchange said that the detour adds an additional 20-30 days to the Asia-Euro-Mediterranean round trip, requiring an extra 30-40 percent of vessel capacity. As the detour continues, there may be a concentration of vessels or a shortage of vessels on the Euro-Mediterranean route, which will disrupt freight rates.It is predicted that after the peak shipping season ends in mid to late January before the China New Year, freight rates typically decrease. However, in mid-March or early April, freight rates gradually increase due to increased demand. The reduction in freight demand will to some extent mitigate the impact of the detour on market shipments and freight rates, and new shipping schedules will be established. However, if the detour continues after March 2024, freight rates will inevitably remain at a higher level, Ningbo Shipping Exchange said.Global Times",SOURCE,ECONOMY,Photo:VCG,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'Red Sea': ('LOC', 7), 'Persian Gulf': ('LOC', 4), 'China': ('LOC', 5), 'Shanghai Port': ('LOC', 1), 'Bab - el - Mandeb Strait': ('LOC', 1), 'Russia': ('LOC', 1), 'Yemen': ('LOC', 2), 'US': ('LOC', 1), 'Aden': ('LOC', 1), 'Israel': ('LOC', 1), 'Man': ('LOC', 1), 'Shanghai Shipping Exchange': ('ORG', 2), 'chinmes': ('ORG', 1), 'Elane': ('ORG', 1), 'Ministry of Commerce': ('ORG', 1), 'Houthis': ('ORG', 1), 'Foreign Ministry': ('ORG', 1), 'Ho': ('ORG', 2), 'Xinh': ('ORG', 1), 'Ba': ('ORG', 1), 'He Yadong': ('PER', 1), 'Mao Ning': ('PER', 1)}"
124,Armchair general Shapps ‘mobilizes the English language’ to fight for his job,Mark Blacklock,2024-01-19,"On Monday, Britain's Defense Secretary Grant Shapps gave an intemperate speech in London about the UK's current defense posture. His first public pronouncement since he took up his post purported to provide an overview of the needs of the country's armed forces, how they can protect the nation's interests and prosecute Britain's foreign policy objectives and how the government will achieve this.It painted a picture of the UK as a bulwark to foreign military challenges, including China, and it painted China and other nations as existential threats to Britain and its way of life. Some of the language used echoed the belligerent rhetoric of the Cold War - and some of it was plain alarmist. Most startlingly, Shapps declared that in five years the UK could be at war with China, Russia, Iran and North Korea - all at the same time. He said the world is moving from a post-war environment to a ""pre-war"" environment. He disparaged those nations as ""unstable and irrational"" and that they ""have the intent to target us."" He also said: ""Old enemies are reanimated. New foes are taking shape. Battle lines are being redrawn."" This is utterly reckless.However, analysis of the more than 3,000-word speech reveals that it is working at three levels.Firstly, the war mentality is mobilized to create in the minds of the British public the imagined threat of a phantom foe, or foes. As part of this, Shapps presents the current government in which he serves as being competent and alive to the threat (and therefore best placed to confront it).Secondly, it adheres slavishly to the policy ambitions of the US, whether it be supporting Ukraine against Russia (at a cost of 7 billion pounds, or $8.9 billion), Israel in Gaza or endorsing the confrontational US activities in and around the ""Indo-Pacific"" and the Red Sea, to name only a few. Where Washington leads, London follows, like a loyal puppy.Thirdly, and closely related to the first theme, running through his tapestry of fiction is a persistent thread of personal interest, relating to the forthcoming General Election in the UK. The speech is an unsophisticated, cynical piece of electioneering.In addition to using the age-old scare tactic of creating an imaginary threat, the speech contains rousing references to both the nation and the government that supposedly serves it. But it also deliberately conflates these with the Conservative Party of which Shapps and his Cabinet colleagues are members, and which is singled out for praise. Opposition parties are deemed ""unpatriotic.""He boasts of increased defense spending - 50 billion pounds ($63.5 billion) a year, more than ever before. He points out that the UK is a significant player in NATO which is ""bigger than ever"" and that the UK is making its largest deployment since the end of the Cold War, with 20,000 personnel committed to the forthcoming Exercise Steadfast Defender. He pompously declares: ""The future of the world order is at stake.""In reality, what is at stake is the job to which he is clinging by his fingernails. The Tory government is predicted by a recent poll to lose spectacularly at the next election, which will be almost certainly this year. What this speech amounts to is a shameless piece of party political campaigning.It is shocking that a senior government minister can talk so irresponsibly. He is prepared to crank up the tensions and temperature with talk of war with China and others not for patriotic purposes but for self-serving party advantage. Warmongering as an election tactic is about as politically cynical as you can get.It's a piece of unsophisticated, opportunistic tub-thumping, so obvious and unsubtle he should be embarrassed.Of course, Shapps is right to be worried about job security. In the year leading up to his current job, he had held four other Cabinet posts in just one year (one for only six days). He is the classic Jack-of-all-trades but Master of none. Sounding off like the poorly informed and misguided civilian that he is, Shapps is performing like the very worst of armchair generals, trotting out that old imperialist lie that attack may be the best form of defense.In these circumstances, it's reasonable to feel sorry for the personnel serving in Britain's armed forces. Impeccably professional, among the best trained and one of the most highly competent militaries in the world, their single most serious vulnerability must be the low-grade quality of their political masters. As warmonger Shapps says, ""The world is becoming more dangerous."" If it is, it's because people like him are making it so.The author is a journalist and lecturer living in Britain. opinion@globaltimes.com.cn",OPINION,VIEWPOINT,Illustration: Chen Xia/ GT,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'Britain': ('LOC', 3), 'London': ('LOC', 2), 'UK': ('LOC', 4), 'China': ('LOC', 3), 'Russia': ('LOC', 2), 'Iran': ('LOC', 1), 'North Korea': ('LOC', 1), 'US': ('LOC', 2), 'Ukraine': ('LOC', 1), 'Israel': ('LOC', 1), 'Gaza': ('LOC', 1), 'Pacific': ('LOC', 1), 'Sea': ('LOC', 1), 'Washington': ('LOC', 1), 'Grant Shapps': ('PER', 3), 'Cold War': ('MISC', 1), 'British': ('MISC', 1), 'Indo': ('MISC', 1)}"

128,The world's most uncertainty: unpredictable course of American politics,Ding Gang,2024-01-16,"Amid a heavy snowfall blanketing the state of Iowa, the US 2024 presidential election cycle commenced with its first votes on Monday evening. The results heralded a victory for former president Donald Trump, who achieved a ""landslide"" triumph over his competitors.This marked the initial victory in Donald Trump's campaign to secure the Republican nomination and boosted his confidence in reclaiming the presidency in November's national election.The irony is that the candidate who arguably contributed to global uncertainty now vows to resolve it.Undoubtedly, Donald Trump and his campaign will continue to rally support with their combative approach. Whether Donald Trump will secure the Republican nomination remains a question, but it is these very uncertainties that add a layer of suspense to the unfolding political drama.It has been three years since the Capitol Hill riot, an event that continues to exacerbate the divide in US politics, leaving political analysts anxious about the potential for violence in the electoral process. Colorado and Maine have already declared Donald Trump ineligible for the 2024 presidential primaries within their borders. Can these states impede his candidacy?On March 4, Donald Trump is scheduled to stand trial on federal charges of attempting to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election. The following day, ""Super Tuesday,"" will see Republican primaries in more than 15 states. Will these events affect Donald Trump's momentum?Globally, the stakes are high, with the situation in Gaza, the Russia-Ukraine conflict and the Red Sea crisis, among others - all intricately linked to the US elections and potentially impacted by its outcome.The EU, a significant ally of the US, has long cast a wary and distrustful gaze upon Donald Trump. EU Commissioner for Internal Market Thierry Breton, referenced a conversation from 2020 between Donald Trump and EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, where Donald Trump suggested that the US might not protect EU if it were attacked. Breton's reminder serves as a nudge to the precariousness of the transatlantic relationship.Even Christine Lagarde, president of the EU Central Bank, who typically refrains from political commentary, expressed concern during an interview with France 2 TV, suggesting that Donald Trump's potential re-election poses an apparent threat to EU, based on his policies during his presidency.The world watches in silence and prepares for change.In China, nowadays, China people generally watch the US elections as a form of entertainment. No matter who comes to power in the US, China is well-prepared for the future trajectory of China-US relations. If Donald Trump is elected, the moves he might make are largely anticipated. However, as the initiator of the trade war with China, it's generally believed Donald Trump's potential comeback could further complicate China-US relations.We are stepping into an era of turmoil, disorder and change, where the most certain aspect is the US' continued dominance in many global spheres. Yet, it is the political evolution of this very nation that stands as the world's most uncertain factor, with reverberating consequences that will shape the international landscape for years to come.The author is a senior editor with People's Daily, and currently a senior fellow with the Chongyang Institute for Financial Studies at Renmin University of China. dinggang@globaltimes.com.cn.

129,US foreign policy in Middle East will become hostage to American domestic politics: renowned expert,Xie Wenting and Bai Yunyi,2024-01-16," Yezid Sayigh, a senior fellow at the Malcolm H. Kerr Carnegie Middle East Center Photo: Courtesy of Yezid Sayigh Editor's Note:Houthi rebels in Yemen said, on Monday, that they attacked a US ship in the Gulf of Aden after US launched airstrikes on Houthis. The situation in the Red Sea has grown increasingly tense in recent weeks, showing the spillover effect of the ongoing conflict in the Gaza. What will possibly happen next? Is it possible for a larger conflict to happen in the Middle East? How will new tensions affect the ongoing Palestine-Israel conflict? Global Times reporters Xie Wenting and Bai Yunyi (Global Times) spoke with Yezid Sayigh (Sayigh), a senior fellow at the Malcolm H. Kerr Carnegie Middle East Center, on these and other pertinent issues. Global Times: The US has launched another airstrike on Houthis in Yemen on Friday. How do you predict the future development of the situation in the Middle East?  How do you assess the possibility of the eruption of a larger conflict that will involve more parties?Sayigh: The fact that the US is taking direct military action crosses a certain threshold. So far, the US has taken a deterrent posture against Iran and Hezbollah, and so on. But it hasn't taken on a major direct combat role. The situation in which they get involved in Yemen, with air attacks on the Houthis, is going to be more complicated.The Houthis are in a much stronger position than forces like the Syria militias or even Iraqi militias in some respects. Their impact on Red Sea shipping is potentially more major for the US to get directly involved militarily.The question then is, what happens next? If the Houthis retaliate and hit back, does the US then escalate its move? How far will they go? Already, the US is increasing the risk of direct confrontation with Iran. If the Houthis are not deterred and continue their attacks, will the US threaten Iran or escalate military action against the Houthis? Both options are highly risky and undesirable.I think the risk of a wider war is obviously increasing. However, at the same time, I think that the key parties will not go beyond a certain point into direct confrontation. At the same time, they have already started what we call an escalation spiral.But the US is in a very risky situation, and it increasingly looks as though it is entering the war on the side of Israel as well. None of this is helpful for their strategic position, and none of this is helpful for the Joe Biden administration. President Joe Biden is starting the election year while possibly starting a new war in the Middle East. Every US president so far for the last 30 years has launched a war in the Middle East: George Bush Senior, Bill Clinton, George Bush Junior, and Obama in different ways. Donald Trump also engaged to some extent. Now we have Joe Biden risking yet another US war in the Middle East after having pulled out of Afghanistan. I think all of this is politically very damaging for the US. But right now, the situation in the Red Sea is partly because Joe Biden decided to support Israel in a certain way by signaling military support - both direct military assistance to Israel and by deploying his naval fleets in the Mediterranean. He has already, in a way, signaled military deterrence that encouraged Iran to use military deterrence. Joe Biden, in a way, started this escalation spiral from the beginning with his immediate deployment of military assets to the Mediterranean. Global Times: What kind of incident would be a trigger point for a direct confrontation between the US and Iran? How do you assess the likelihood of such confrontation happening?Sayigh: I think that the direct use of more technologically advanced missiles by the Houthis against US navy ships in the Red Sea could be perceived by the US as a qualitative shift. This could lead the US to realize that bombing more Houthi targets is pointless unless it engages in large-scale bombings, but this is problematic. Alternatively, it may choose to directly threaten Iran, which is also problematic. It is difficult to say whether such a confrontation is likely or not. On one side, Joe Biden has embarked on a path which, in order to maintain credibility, he must continue on a course that raises the risk of confrontation. I think because we're now talking about Red Sea shipping and the threat to global trade, which the US government has basically said it's going to protect, it's harder for Joe Biden to retreat. Global Times: How long do you think the current situation of disrupted shipping in the Red Sea will last?  Is it possible for the US to assert de facto control over the Red Sea under the pretext of counterterrorism?Sayigh: The US cannot afford, in terms of their strategic credibility, to allow the Houthis to continue this nonstop for much longer. But how can the US stop it? This is a more difficult question. They would have to militarily punish the Houthis enough for them to say the pain is too great and they must stop. But the Houthis can probably take a lot of damage before they stop. It is interesting to think back to the 1980s when Iraq and Iran engaged in attacks on shipping in the Gulf in an attempt to disrupt each other's oil shipments and coerce one another into ending the war. Later the US intervened and deployed a substantial naval presence.Are we looking at the same scenario today? Maybe. But let's remember that in the 1980s, the shipping war lasted for a very long time. It involved a major US deployment, and it wasn't easy to stop. So, I think it's a difficult challenge for them today. They're fighting the Houthis, who of course, are much weaker than Iran and Iraq. But in a way, they're also a difficult target because they're a poor army already. It's not like you're attacking a country that has a lot to lose. There aren't many high-value targets that can be struck if the US attacks the airport, oil refineries, or oil tankers, for example. The US is causing misery for one of the poorest nations on earth, where 80 percent of people depend on food supplied by the UN. What is the US going to do? Is it going to increase the food crisis, energy crisis, and poverty crisis of a country that is already devastated by war? The options are all very bad, and lack obvious military solutions. The risk for the US is that Joe Biden will have to increase airstrikes from 10 to 20, and then to 40. This escalation appears to be the start of a new US war in the Middle East, which poses a significant problem for a president who is facing elections this year. The costs to start a war in the Middle East are too high.Global Times: Considering the recent developments in the Middle East, how long do you think the conflict between Israel and Hamas will continue, and in which direction is it likely to evolve?Sayigh: All I anticipate for Israel and Palestine is that the Israel combat in Gaza will continue for many more months to come. For now, there is no meaningful West pressure on Israel to change its strategy. The West response, which disregarded international humanitarian law and the rules of war, also signifies a moment of change in world history. The liberal order that the West claims to protect and uphold since 1945 has been abandoned by the West itself. But I think that West governments won't change their policy. This is because the US is going through a presidential election, and no president in the US is going to confront Israel in an election year. I believe this remains the case.I think the one thing that is happening right now, which is really interesting, is the South Africa's genocide case against Israel in the International Criminal Court. This is a significant diplomatic act. It won't force Israel to stop what it's doing, but if the court issues any kind of ruling against Israel, I think that will be very significant for public opinion. The bottom line is, I think, Israel will continue its military operations, and as long as West governments allow this, the fighting will continue and the damage to West credibility in the rest of the world will continue. An aircraft returns to base at RAF Akrotiri in Cyprus, after conducting strikes on targets in Yemen, as part of the airstrikes launched by the US and the UK on Houthis, on January 12, 2024. Photo: VCGGT:  What are the potential flashpoints in the Middle East that could lead to conflicts or unforeseen events in the near future? What broader impacts will the recent events in the Middle East have globally?Sayigh: A year ago, it was evident that the Joe Biden administration was attempting to de-escalate tensions with Iran by releasing funds and implementing various measures. However, the current dynamic has shifted in the opposite direction, which is a cause for concern. What is most scary here is that in the US, domestic politics are now a factor affecting how the Joe Biden administration calculates its costs and benefits in foreign policy. It no longer calculates foreign policy purely on the basis of strategic and global stability, as it was previously doing by improving relations with Iran or at least defusing tensions with Iran. That was when it was thinking globally. However, now the administration has to consider domestic politics, and the calculation there is different. Foreign policy in the Middle East will become hostage to US domestic politics, which is very dangerous.Israel domestic politics are also very important now, as Benjamin Netanyahu knows that once the war ceases, the Israel public will demand accountability for the failure on October 7, which was a security failure. Many Israelis want his departure from office, leading to calls for new elections. So, in both cases, domestic politics shape their foreign policy and military policy in a very dangerous way, which is different from a year ago. Who knows what the flashpoint is? It almost doesn't matter. In WWI, the flashpoint was when the nephew of the Austrian emperor was assassinated in Sarajevo. War happened not because he was important (he wasn't important at all), but was because for 20 or 30 years, the trade war was rising. The competition for colonies was also rising among the global powers. By 1914, the world was ready for war. Global tensions had reached a point where it was the assassination that was the trigger, but it might have been something else. It could have been sinking a boat at sea. It could have been anything. So, we're in a very dangerous moment when Hamas, in a way, on October 7, did something like Sarajevo. They started a process of the falling apart and the collapse of a world order that was already decaying and degrading. But it was the moment when it became visible. The change in the international order has been happening for 20 or more years.Global Times: How will the current crises in the region affect the reconciliation process between Saudi Arabia and Iran?Sayigh: It is not clear at all. I think the Saudis are very worried about everything that is happening. They want good ties with the US and also desire a defense treaty with them. However, this situation is very tricky as it is linked to other factors. If there is an escalation in confrontation between the US and Iran, it becomes harder for the Saudis to reconcile with Iran. The Saudis have an interest in maintaining an autonomous foreign policy and establishing a significant energy relationship with East Asia in general, and China in particular. However, there may come a moment where the US pushes the Saudis to choose between having close ties with China or a defense treaty with them. I don't know for sure, but I can foresee how in one or two years, these choices could become very difficult to make.Global Times: Considering the conflicts in the Middle East and their spillover effects, will the US process of shifting its strategic focus from the Middle East to the Asia-Pacific be slowed down?Sayigh: I don't think the US has ever, as it was, pulled out of the Middle East, and it isn't going to pull out of the Middle East. However, that doesn't prevent it from increasing its attention and focus on East Asia. It is not an either-or situation. However, the real question is about the US' position in the world at a time when other powers are rising militarily, economically, and scientifically. Is the US' relative superiority declining enough that its ability to manage world affairs and maintain a high level of investment, both militarily and technologically, becoming more difficult and costly? Can the US maintain this? I think we are witnessing a moment where we should never underestimate US power. I believe it remains the dominant power, but there is a process of readjustment by the US.

130,"US escalates Red Sea tensions, while China voices fairness",Global Times,2024-01-16,"The Red Sea, once a bustling waterway that attracted a large number of cargo ships from around the world, is now in turmoil. Amid all the intricacy and complexity, China has raised a fair voice.In the Egypt capital of Cairo on Sunday, China Foreign Minister Wang Yi expressed grave concern over the escalating tensions in the Red Sea. He called for an end to the harassment of civilian vessels in the Red Sea, while noting that the UN has never authorized any country to use force against Yemen. Wang called for refraining from taking any actions that will ""add fuel to the fire"" in the Red Sea and raise the overall security risks in the region.China's fairness lies in not taking sides or showing bias. This is in stark contrast to how West countries touch upon on the Gaza war, in which they tend to overwhelmingly blame Hamas without mentioning the reasons behind Hamas' attacks. China, on the other hand, does not support the Houthis' use of violence to disrupt the trade route in the Red Sea, but it also disagrees with the US-led biased approach and double standards in the hostilities between Israel and Palestine, as well as the use of violence to counter violence.Wang said the UN has never authorized any country to use force against Yemen. To be straightforward, the West alliance's attack in the region is unauthorized and illegal. Houthis'attacks in the Red Sea is a protest against Israel's actions in the Gaza war, which actually has caused widespread opposition from the international community, Song Zhongping, a China military expert and TV commentator, told the Global Times. When the Houthis vowed to attack ships in the Red Sea that are linked to Israel, how did the US respond to that? Escalation. The US first launched a multinational coalition against the Yemeni militants. After seeing the effectiveness of the operation was unsatisfactory, the US and UK militaries launched strikes against Houthi targets in Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen. The missions failed to stop Houthis from attacking shipping, and now Houthis are targeting US ships. A Houthi anti-ship ballistic missile struck a US-owned and operated cargo ship on Monday. What's the point of that escalation?This retaliation and counter-retaliation are snowballing in the Red Sea. It is now evident that the US and the UK have underestimated the military capabilities of the Houthi militants. Experts believe that the US will find it difficult to contain the Houthis, and that the Red Sea crisis won't be resolved any time soon. Against this backdrop, media outlets from various countries have noticed an interesting phenomenon: Maritime ships are signaling their China identity in the Red Sea to avoid being targeted by the Houthis.This is a reflection of China's soft power. ""The Houthi militants have no interest in attacking China ships. The reason is simple - China makes fair remarks and takes fair actions concerning Middle East affairs. China does not have any special interests in the region and cares only about regional peace, security, and stability,"" Shen Yi, a professor at Fudan University, told the Global Times.China has played a constructive role in fostering peace in the Middle East. The China-mediated detente between Iran and Saudi Arabia has driven a ""wave of reconciliation"" in the Middle East. The Saudi Arabia League decided to re-admit Syria after shunning it for 12 years. Turkey and Egypt realized full normalization of relations, ending nearly a decade of diplomatic hostility.After the Gaza conflict broke out, Special Envoy of the China Government on the Middle East Issue Zhai Jun visited a number of Middle East countries calling for ceasefire and creation of conditions for the resumption of the peace process. China has also joined in the co-sponsorship of the draft UN resolution aimed at removing bottlenecks to humanitarian access and alleviating the humanitarian disaster in Gaza. In contrast, US' comprehensive and overt support for Israel has directly led to the prolongation and escalation of the war. It is also due to the obstruction by the US that the UN has repeatedly postponed the draft resolution aimed at bringing in some form of ceasefire. The biggest difference between China and the US in Middle East affairs is that China is a responsible major power, and its responsible actions have been recognized by all parties, Shen said.As Wang mentioned in Egypt, the priority now is to stop the conflict as soon as possible to prevent it from further escalation or even getting out of control.If Washington and London genuinely want an end of the crisis in the Red Sea, the only way out is to end the Gaza crisis, withdraw what should be withdrawn, end wrong support, and apply pressure where it's needed.",OPINION,OBSERVER,Illustration: Chen Xia/GT,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'Red Sea': ('LOC', 8), 'China': ('LOC', 5), 'Egypt': ('LOC', 1), 'Cairo': ('LOC', 1), 'Yemen': ('LOC', 3), 'Gaza': ('LOC', 2), 'US': ('LOC', 7), 'Israel': ('LOC', 3), 'Palestine': ('LOC', 1), 'UK': ('LOC', 2), 'Wang Yi': ('PER', 3), 'Song Zhongping': ('PER', 1), 'UN': ('ORG', 2), 'Hamas': ('ORG', 2), 'Global Times': ('ORG', 1), 'West': ('MISC', 2), 'Houthis': ('MISC', 5), 'Yemenisat': ('MISC', 1), 'Houthi': ('MISC', 2), 'Houth': ('MISC', 2)}"
131,World needs to prepare for ‘more uncertainties’ as Iowa caucuses kick off,Xu Yelu,2024-01-15,"As the US election year race kicks off in Iowa on Monday, experts suggest that the world should prepare for the possibility of Donald Trump being re-elected as President of the US and a United States that is more divided.According to a new ABC News/Ipsos poll published on Sunday, a day ahead of the Iowa caucuses, as the 2024 race to the White House speeds up, Donald Trump is ahead of his Republican opponents on key measures of popularity, while US President Joe Biden's job approval rating has hit a new low.The survey showed that former President Donald Trump leads with a huge advantage against the other Republican candidates - Ron DeSantis, Nikki Haley, Vivek Ramaswamy and Asa Hutchinson - on three fronts.At least 68 percent of Republican and GOP-leaning independents say Donald Trump is the candidate with the ""best chance"" of getting elected in November.Overall, more than 70 percent of Republican adults would be satisfied with Donald Trump as a nominee.According to the survey, Joe Biden's job approval rating has dropped to a record low for any US president in the past 15 years.China experts believe that judging from the current situation, Donald Trump is unchallenged within his party, and once the general election phase begins, Joe Biden may not be a strong opponent for Donald Trump. This means the world may need to prepare for the possibility of Donald Trump returning to power and a more divided US with fighting between the political parties getting worse.With just one day to go until Iowa's presidential caucuses, candidates are urging their supporters to brave bone-chilling cold and blustery wind to help carry them through the Republican' leadoff voting contest.The main problem for Donald Trump lies in legal battles, Liu Weidong, a research fellow at the Institute of US Studies at the China Academy of Social Science told the Global Times on Monday. Some cases have already had hearings, while others are awaiting ruling. For Donald Trump, the main concern is whether these lawsuits will have a significant impact, especially if new evidence emerges that could further harm him, Liu said.Donald Trump, who faces 91 felony charges in four different cases, is also facing attempts to keep him from appearing on state ballots for having inspired the violence at the Capitol on January 6, 2021.Multiple states in the US have filed lawsuits in an attempt to cancel Donald Trump's eligibility to run for president in these states. Similar lawsuits have previously been dismissed by courts in Michigan, Florida, and New Hampshire. The Supreme Court of Minnesota has also rejected a case seeking to cancel his candidacy.With the presidential caucuses already underway, the Democratic Party has been trying hard to bring down Donald Trump through the judiciary means, Lü Xiang, a research fellow at the China Academy of Social Sciences told the Global Times. The Republican Party's strategy is to focus on investigations into Joe Biden's son, while the Democratic Party aims to target Donald Trump through lawsuits in certain states. However, these lawsuits may not necessarily have an impact on Donald Trump, Lü noted. ""The polling data in the US is quite transparent, and Donald Trump's approval ratings indicate that he is still a very competitive candidate. The world should be prepared for this,"" he said.The 2024 race has attracted global attention as the US has been involved in two protracted wars, the Russia-Ukraine conflict and the Palestine-Israel war, as well as the escalating tension in the Asia-Pacific region. Experts are also concerned that the US election campaign will bring more uncertainties to the already tumultuous world situation.",Category one not found,Category two not found,Donald Trump Photo:VCG,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'US': ('LOC', 6), 'Iowa': ('LOC', 3), 'United States': ('LOC', 1), 'White House': ('LOC', 1), 'China': ('LOC', 1), 'Michigan': ('LOC', 1), 'Donald Trump': ('PER', 12), 'Joe Biden': ('PER', 3), 'Ron DeSantis': ('PER', 1), 'Nikki Haley': ('PER', 1), 'Vivek Ramaswamy': ('PER', 1), 'Asa Hutchinson': ('PER', 1), 'Liu Weidong': ('PER', 2), 'ABC News / Ipsos': ('ORG', 1), 'Institute of US Studies': ('ORG', 1), 'China Academy of Social Science': ('ORG', 1), 'Republican': ('MISC', 5), 'GOP': ('MISC', 1)}"
132,"China, Arab League urging immediate, comprehensive cease-fire of Israel-Palestine conflict",GT staff reporters,2024-01-15,"China and the League of Saudi Arabia States issued a joint statement on the Israel-Palestine conflict on Sunday, urging an immediate and comprehensive cease-fire and stressing the two-state solution as ""a basis"" for any future settlement concerning the fate of the Palestine people in the Gaza and the West Bank.While China is going all out to advocate for a cease-fire of the Gaza conflict, restoration of peace and protection of the safety of civilians, the US and the UK are trying to shift public attention from the conflict to other tensions including those in the Red Sea, in an attempt to portray themselves as defenders of order, China experts pointed out, while noting that the rising Red Sea tensions are rooted in the Israel-Palestine conflict, and only after the conflict is solved can spillover tensions be eased.On Sunday, after China Foreign Minister Wang Yi, also a member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, met with Saudi Arabia League Secretary-General Ahmed Aboul-Gheit in Egypt capital Cairo, the two sides issued the joint statement.The statement noted that China and the Saudi Arabia side support the holding of an inclusive dialogue with the participation of all Palestine factions that is committed to achieving Palestine reconciliation.It called for an international peace conference with broad participation as soon as possible to promote the implementation of the two-state solution, and resuming peace talks between Palestine and Israel on this basis.The two sides also expressed deep concern in the statement over the recent escalation of the situation in the Red Sea and stressed that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Yemen should be respected while ensuring the safety of international commercial routes in the Red Sea, which is a priority for international peace and security.With the current round of the Israel-Palestine conflict entering its 100th day on January 14 local time, in Gaza, fierce fighting continues. At the same time, the negative spillover effect is accelerating after the US and UK conducted a new strike on Yemen's Red Sea port city of Hodeidah on Sunday evening, according to the Houthi-run al-Masirah TV.Xinhua noted that the US and Britain have stated that the strikes came in an attempt to deter the Yemeni Houthi group from launching further attacks on international shipping in the Red Sea, a vital waterway for global trade.The Houthis said that their operations aimed to prevent what it called ""Israel-linked ships"" from passing through the Red Sea until Israel ends its attack and siege on the Gaza.The US and its ally are apparently attempting to shift the focus from the original Israel-Palestine conflict, pointed out Li Weijian, a research fellow with the Institute for Foreign Policy Studies of the Shanghai Institutes for International Studies.Li told the Global Times on Monday that the US, due to its unconditional support for Israel and its unwillingness to effectively persuade it to cease fire, is facing significant international pressure and criticism, making its current situation quite awkward. As a result, the US hopes to shift public attention by focusing on the Houthis and demonstrating its sense of ""justice"" in ""protecting the order"" of international shipping in the Red Sea, Li said.However, it is clear to everyone that if the Israel-Palestine issue is not resolved, the airstrikes by the US and the UK will not have a positive effect and may even escalate the conflict, the expert noted.If Red Sea tensions spread, it will affect trade activities along the Red Sea and the Persian Gulf, leading to increased time and costs for shipping and even impacting oil prices, Zhu Yongbiao, executive director of the Research Center for the Belt and Road at Lanzhou University, told the Global Times on Monday.The overall impact has just begun, and whether Red Sea tensions will have a greater impact on the future global economy due to confrontation between the Houthis and the US is being further observed, Li said.But he believes that the Joe Biden administration will focus more on the US elections in 2024 and avoid opening a third front.Since the outbreak of the latest Palestinian-Israeli Conflict, China has all long stood on the side of equity and justice and done our best to realize a ceasefire, restore peace and protect civilians, Mao Ning, spokesperson for the China Foreign Ministry, said at a press conference on Monday. She cited remarks by Wang Yi in Egypt as stressing that cease-fire is the prevailing priority, and humanitarian aid is the imperative moral responsibility.The spokesperson continued by saying that the future arrangement of Gaza must fully respect Palestine' aspiration, and the two-state solution is the sure path to a just settlement of the Palestine issue. China will continue to take an impartial stand, play its role as a major responsible country, and relentlessly work with the international community for a comprehensive, just and sustainable settlement of the Palestine issue at an early date, she said.However, some West media outlets such as Bloomberg are trying to smear China's role in the conflict.Starting with the claim that ""As the US and UK launch airstrikes to stop Iran-backed Houthi rebels from attacking ships in the Red Sea, China again finds itself happily sitting on the sidelines,"" Bloomberg attempts to defame China's efforts during the conflict and portray China as a ""country just paying lip service.""However, the old tricks used to smear China are clearly untenable, as China experts pointed out that the UN has not authorized the US or its ally to air strike against the Houthis.The US, which is pouring fuel on the fire in the Israel-Palestine conflict, also wants to play the role of fireman, and at the same time accuses other countries of watching from the sidelines. But in fact, the US is responsible for the conflict, Zhu said.""We have a common responsibility to ensure the security of the Red Sea, and we will not be deceived by the US to fuel such tensions,"" Li said.As many problems are rooted in the Israel-Palestine conflict, we should stress a return to the solution of the fundamental problem on the road, he stated, noting that as long as the conflict has a comprehensive cease-fire, Red Sea tensions will naturally calm down.",CHINA,DIPLOMACY,"Smoke rises following an Israeli airstrike in the southern Gaza Strip city of Khan Younis, Jan. 13, 2024.

135,"China to stress openness at WEF, defy trade protectionism",Wang Cong,2024-01-14,"China will highlight its vision of an open world economy and win-win cooperation at the World Economic Forum (WEF) annual meeting and send a resounding signal that it will continue to open up its market for the world, which will stand in sharp contrast to the focus of some West officials on geopolitical rivalry that has plagued the world economy, businesses and experts said on Sunday. China Premier Li Qiang will attend the WEF annual meeting and is scheduled to deliver a special address on Tuesday morning local time. Li's attendance underscores great importance China attaches to the WEF and multilateral cooperation as well as its commitment for openness and multilateralism, experts said. China's unwavering commitment to opening-up and the steady recovery of its economy have become a highlight for the world economy, which is facing serious risks and challenges, including rising trade protectionism and geopolitical tension, global businesses and experts said. China remains the locomotive for global economic development, they noted. Asked about China's hopes for the WEF annual meeting, Mao Ning, a spokesperson for the China Foreign Ministry, said on Thursday that ""in a world fraught with uncertainties and a struggle to find drivers for growth, we look to increase exchanges and communication and enhance mutual understanding and trust with other parties to the forum to contribute our part to better global economic recovery and governance and joint response to challenges.""In addition to attending the WEF annual meeting, Li will also pay official visits to Switzerland and Ireland, according to the China Foreign Ministry, marking the first high-level major diplomatic event for the China Premier in 2024. The trip will kick off high-level exchanges between China and EU this year, the ministry said.Li's attendance at the WEF annual meeting has in particular drawn widespread attention, as the world economy remains in a serious downturn and risks and challenges such as the rise of trade fragmentation. Many also have great expectation for China's economic recovery to drive global growth. ""By having such a high-level representation at the WEF, China shows great importance it attaches to the meeting, and also coveys to the world China's firm determination to continue to support the establishment of an open world economy and maintain the healthy development of economic globalization,"" Sang Baichuan, dean of the Institute of International Economy at the University of International Business and Economics, told the Global Times on Sunday. Sang said China will promote multilateralism and strengthen communication at this forum to bridge differences, especially amid world economic uncertainty and relatively weak economic recovery after the epidemic.That is also in line with the WEF annual meeting's theme of ""rebuilding trust."" Rising mistrust has become a serious problem for the global economy, as many major economies, the US in particular, have taken an increasingly protectionist approach. Washington is also focusing on geopolitical rivalry and constantly overstretching the concept of national security, instead of global cooperation. Such a focus is also likely to be on display, as Washington is sending Jake Sullivan, US national security adviser, according to the published schedule. ""In comparison, the US is expected to still verbally support globalization and talk about strengthening cooperation, but in practice, it will continue to decouple from and suppress countries that it believes pose institutional competition and have strategic differences,"" Sang said. Open for business While many West officials are expected to focus on conflicts such as the Russia-Ukraine conflict and the war in the Gaza, China officials will focus on economic development and cooperation, experts said. ""We believe Premier Li will further emphasize the fact that China is open for business and will continue along the path of market reforms and liberalization. In other words, we see China responding tactically to trade war dynamics, with precision strikes, but we don't see China moving away from its fundamental strategy of opening up its economies to foreign partners,"" Rani Jarkas, chairman of Cedrus Group, told the Global Times. China has repeatedly vowed to further open up its market for global businesses. The Central Economic Work Conference in December 2023, which set economic priorities for 2024, pledged efforts to stabilize foreign trade and investment. Specifically, it said that market access for telecommunications, medical and other service industries shall be eased. ""Faced with the backdrop of rising global protectionism and competition between China and the US, China will further send signals that it would continue to expand opening-up,"" Sun Yanhong, a senior research fellow at the Institute of EU Studies, China Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times on Sunday, noting that it's likely that China will announce some opening-up measures at the WEF annual meeting.China's continued opening-up and its steady economic recovery are injecting desperately needed impetus to the global economy, according to businesses and experts. ""With solid import growth, China has started to act again as the locomotive for the global economy, despite that internal demand growth is still below pre-COVID levels. We expect this recovery trend to continue in 2024, with stronger growth in internal demand and imports,"" said Jarkas. Jarkas further noted that the recent drop in China's foreign direct investment as a sign that West firms are repatriating profits due to liquidity issues in their home markets, and not because China is losing its attraction as an investment destination. ""We believe FDI will increase rapidly once the monetary policy in the West becomes looser."" Saadia Zahidi, managing director of the WEF, told Xinhua last week that ""China is one of the key economies in the world, and so the health of that economy then has very positive spillovers for the rest of the world.""China is scheduled to release economic data on Wednesday, which is widely expected to show that China's economic growth meet or even exceeds the official growth target of around 5 percent in 2023. China's economic recovery is expected to further consolidate in 2024, with some economists projecting an above 5 percent growth for the year.",SOURCE,ECONOMY,"Photo taken on Jan. 21, 2019 shows the logo of the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos, Switzerland.

136,Chinese FM kicks off Africa visit in Egypt,Deng Xiaoci,2024-01-14,"China Foreign Minister Wang Yi on Saturday night local time arrived in Egypt, the first leg of his four-nation Africa tour this week. This is the 34th consecutive year when a China foreign minister has visited Africa as their first overseas trip at the beginning of the year.Coming shortly after Egypt President Abdel-Fattah al-Sisi's successful reelection in December 2023, and amid the already 100-day Palestinian-Israeli Conflict in the Middle East, Wang's visit is of great significance, China analysts said. They predicted that further coordinating their positions concerning hot-spot issues, especially the Palestinian-Israeli Conflict in the Gaza, and its spillover in the region such as the Red Sea turmoil, will be high on the agenda during Wang's exchanges with Egypt officials.China and Egypt are to explore the potentials of their bilateral and multilateral cooperation in a variety of fields under multilateral frameworks that include the China-proposed BRI and BRICS, analysts said on Sunday. On Sunday, President Sisi met with Wang Yi in Cairo. The Egypt president expressed gratitude for China's strong support for Egypt's social and economic development, noting significant achievements in jointly building the BRI.He reaffirmed Egypt's commitment to the one-China principle and opposition to interference in China's internal affairs.Wang Yi thanked Egypt for supporting China's rightful stance. China appreciates Egypt's active response to the BRI and will remain to be a long-term, reliable strategic partner in Egypt's development and revitalization. China aims to strengthen the alignment of development strategies and practical cooperation for greater achievements, working together toward modernization, Wang said.Both sides agreed to continue strengthening communication and collaboration within frameworks such as BRICS and the UN. Wang Yi stated that Egypt, as an Saudi Arabia, African, Islamic, and developing major country, is congratulated on becoming a new member of BRICS. They also exchanged views on the Palestinian-Israeli Conflict situation, agreeing on the need for an immediate cease-fire and preventing further conflict escalation. A joint statement regarding the situation was issued.During the visit, Wang Yi and Egypt Foreign Minister Shoukry also discussed and signed the second five-year plan for the China-Egypt comprehensive strategic partnership.Wang Yi, in a joint press conference with Shoukry after their talks, expressed deep concern over the recent rapid escalation of the situation in the Red Sea, and called for an end to attacks on civilian ships. At the same time, China believes that the UN has never authorized any country to use force against Yemen, and actions should be avoided that would add fuel to the tension in the Red Sea and increase the overall security risks in the region. It must be emphasized that the tension in the Red Sea is a prominent manifestation of the spillover of the Gaza conflict, Wang said. The urgent task is to quickly quell the war in Gaza to prevent the conflict from further expanding or even getting out of control. All parties need to jointly maintain the safety of the Red Sea waterway in accordance with the law, while genuinely respecting the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Red Sea coastal countries, including Yemen, he noted.Egypt is the first African nation Wang would visit during his current Africa trip, which is of significance, coming so soon after President Abdel-Fattah al-Sisi's successful reelection. The Egypt government has launched development plans and targets, including attracting investment and boosting tourism, to tackle the country's economic challenges, He Wenping, a director with the Institute of West Asian and African Studies under the China Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times on Sunday.Regarding bilateral and multilateral cooperation, Zhu Yongbiao, executive director of the Research Center for the Belt and Road at Lanzhou University, told the Global Times that the conversation will be carried out within the framework of the China-proposed BRI, as well as under the BRICS framework.BRICS inducted five new member countries - Saudi Arabia, the United Saudi Arabia Emirates, Egypt, Iran and Ethiopia - into the bloc in early January 2024. The integration of new member states marked a major expansion for the bloc originally founded by Russia, Brazil, China, and India in 2006, and later joined by South Africa in 2011. Wang's visit seeks to implement the outcomes of the China-Africa Leaders' Dialogue held in August, 2023 in Johannesburg, South Africa, according to Zhu. China announced at the 2023 Leaders' Dialogue it would launch the Initiative on Supporting Africa's Industrialization, the Plan for China Supporting Africa's Agricultural Modernization and the Plan for China-Africa Cooperation on Talent Development, as part of the efforts to chart the course for China-Africa practical cooperation in the next stage and help Africa bring its integration and modernization into a fast track, according to the Xinhua. China and Africa will host the ninth ministerial conference of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC) in China in 2024, which will likely take place in Beijing towards the end of the year. FOCAC is hailed by the international community as an epitome of an efficient and effective platform for South-South cooperation and is a springboard for Africa and China to firmly support each other in strengthening development interests and collaboration in international affairs, as well as at multilateral occasions.China-Egypt cooperation covers various fields, including infrastructure like development of the new Egypt capital, railway projects and space collaboration with the launch of Egypt's second satellite. There is also cooperation in oil development, with new oil fields discovered in Egypt, as well as in aviation and technology, He Wenping said. Wang's visit will further align the China-proposed BRI with Egypt's 2030 development vision. Egypt's new government has many plans in motion, including tourism cooperation and dealing with their foreign exchange shortage, which might involve trade and import of non-Egypt agricultural products. All these areas are expected to feature in the bilateral discussions and potential cooperation agreements, He explained.",CHINA,DIPLOMACY,Photo: VCG,"Reporter, Beijing",Global Times reporter tracking China's space programs and cutting-edge science and technology projects.,"{'China': ('LOC', 12), 'Egypt': ('LOC', 13), 'Africa': ('LOC', 2), 'Middle East': ('LOC', 1), 'Gaza': ('LOC', 1), 'Red Sea': ('LOC', 2), 'Cairo': ('LOC', 1), 'Saudi Arabia': ('LOC', 1), 'Wang Yi': ('PER', 9), 'Abdel - Fattah al - Sisi': ('PER', 2), 'Palestinian - Israeli Conflict': ('MISC', 4), 'BRI': ('MISC', 3), 'one': ('MISC', 1), 'African': ('MISC', 1), 'Islamic': ('MISC', 1), 'S': ('MISC', 2), 'BRICS': ('ORG', 3), 'UN': ('ORG', 1)}"
138,US urged not to use military measures in Red Sea crisis,GT staff reporters,2024-01-13,"The situation in the Red Sea may become even more complicated if Yemen's Houthi rebels engage in a conflict with the US and its allies. Analysts noted that this could lead to further spillover beyond the crisis in the sea, especially considering the absence of a political solution to the Palestinian-Israeli Conflict and they also urged the US to stop using military measures and go back to the path of seeking a political solution.After the US and the UK launched strikes from the air and sea against Houthi military targets in Yemen on Thursday, Houthi Deputy Foreign Minister Hussein Al-Ezzi said in a post on X that the attackers were going to pay a heavy price.The US and UK military forces have completed targeted strikes in Yemen, hoping to stop Houthi attacks on ships in the Red Sea. More than 100 precision missiles were reportedly used in striking over 60 targets at 16 locations, including command and control nodes, munitions depots, launching systems, production facilities, and air defense radar systems. Fighter jets, navy destroyers, a submarine and Tomahawk cruise missiles were all used in the blitz. The intended targets were hit, officials claimed, according to media reports.The escalation of the crisis in the Red Sea has concerned the international community. The UN (UN) on Wednesday approved a resolution calling on Yemen's Houthi rebel group to ""cease its brazen"" attacks in the Red Sea. Analysts said the UN resolution should not be seen as a green light for the US military action in the region, and nor should it be misused to create a new strained situation.China is concerned over the escalating tension in the Red Sea and calls on all relevant parties to remain calm and exercise restraint, in order to avoid further escalation of conflict, China Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said at a press conference on Friday.Mao noted that the Red Sea area is an important international trade route for goods and energy, and that all parties involved can play a constructive and responsible role in maintaining the security and stability of the Red Sea, which is in line with the common interests of the international community.Zhang Xuefeng, a China military expert, told the Global Times that the US and UK's strike serves as a warning to the Houthi rebels, but its deterrent effect may be limited.The crisis in the Red Sea is a consequence of the ongoing Palestinian-Israeli Conflict. Following the Thursday strike, the US and its allies may consider intensifying their attacks against the Houthi rebels. However, this could lead to more retaliatory strikes from the Houthi rebels, potentially targeting US military bases in the Middle East. Such escalation could expand the conflict and draw the US deeper into the regional turmoil, said Zhang.Previously, the US had been reluctant to expand its strikes on the Houthi militia, as it is primarily focused on competition with other major countries. Moreover, with the US entering an election cycle, an expansion of the war in the Middle East could introduce more uncertainties into the election, analysts said.The Houthi militia will not stop retaliating against the US and UK, and both sides will be engaged in continued and possibly escalated mutual attacks. Once significant casualties occur, the conflict will become even more tense, and the Red Sea will be at a more complex crossroads, Ding Long, a professor with the Middle East Studies Institute of Shanghai International Studies University, told the Global Times.The Palestinian-Israeli Conflict is also the catalyst for the Houthi's attacks on commercial ships, and resolving the Red Sea crisis depends on a cease-fire between Israel and Palestine. However, the US deliberately conceals the connection between the Red Sea crisis and the Palestinian-Israeli Conflict, attempting to portray them as isolated events and only emphasizing the illegality and harm caused by the Houthis, said Ding.Ding said that whether it is the Palestinian-Israeli Conflict issue, the Yemen issue, or the Red Sea issue, facts have proven that military means cannot solve these problems and will only worsen the situation.The US, the UK and other parties should recognize the urgency of the situation and return to the path of political resolution, and the international community should also form a consensus to jointly promote political solutions, said Ding.",WORLD,MID-EAST,"Fire is seen after an airstrike launched by the US and Britain near Sanaa in Yemen, January 12, 2024.

139,Chinese FM's traditional visit to Africa opens important chapter,Joyce Chimbi,2024-01-13," In keeping with tradition, China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi has traveled to Africa to visit Egypt, Tunisia, Togo and Cote d'Ivoire at the invitation of these countries from January 13 to 18. The visit marks the 34th consecutive year in which a China foreign minister has visited Africa as their first overseas trip at the beginning of the year.The six-day visit is a continuation of China's ever-deepening relationship with the African continent and builds on previous landmark engagements toward a shared, prosperous future. This particular visit seeks to implement the outcomes of the China-Africa Leaders' Dialogue held in August 2023 in Johannesburg, South Africa.To chart a path for Africa-China practical cooperation, the Leaders' Dialogue issued a joint statement, with China releasing the Initiative on Supporting Africa's Industrialization, the Plan for China Supporting Africa's Agricultural Modernization, and the Plan for China-Africa Cooperation on Talent Development. Foreign Minister Wang was present at the Leaders' Dialogue.China's 2024 inaugural visit to four African countries was particularly meaningful as it sets the tone for the next phase of the continent's relationship with its Eastern partner. More so, it comes ahead of the ninth Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC) new session to be held in Beijing later this year following the eighth session in Dakar, Senegal.FOCAC is the epitome of an efficient and effective platform for South-South Cooperation and is a springboard for Africa and China to firmly support each other in strengthening development interests and collaboration in international affairs, as well as multilateral occasions.Egypt, Tunisia, Togo and Cote d'Ivoire are all China's friendly partners in cooperation. China's foreign ministry has stressed that the visit will also ""carry forward the traditional China-Africa friendship and consolidate the momentum of China-Africa solidarity and cooperation."" Against this backdrop, there is no doubt that this year will open another remarkable chapter in history, between China and Africa. Egypt has a long history of diplomatic relations with China. In 1956, Egypt became the first Saudi Arabia and African nation to establish diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China and the two have never faltered in their shared commitments since.China and Egypt have since signed various agreements on trade, cultural cooperation as well as scientific and technological development. The two nations have opened critical economic and strategic opportunities built upon friendship and mutual trust.Situated at the center of the North African coast, Tunisia is part of the BRI (BRI). In line with its aim to connect the globe, BRI countries are spread across all continents and 44 countries are in sub-Saharan Africa, making it the largest BRI block. The second-largest block of 34 BRI countries is in EU and Central Asia.Tunisia interacts with China and like-minded friendly nations through FOCAC, China-Saudi Arabia States Cooperation Forum as well as through bilateral engagements, strengthening development and cultural cooperation. In 2023, China celebrated 51 years of cooperation with Togo and the Eastern nation is today's Togo's principal commercial partner and one of its principal sources of investment. As China's presence in the Saudi Arabia world expands in breadth and depth, its footprint in West Africa is notable. From a political perspective, Cote d'Ivoire has stood shoulder-to-shoulder with the government of the People's Republic of China. There have been numerous key meetings and dialogues between the two nations leading to the landmark signing of the Comprehensive Strategic Cooperative Partnership Agreement between China and Cote d'Ivoire in 2018.Over the last decade, China has shown a commitment to boosting Africa's security and visiting North Africa against the backdrop of the Israel-Palestine conflict shows that China is particularly keen to play a role in maintaining peace, security and stability.Over the last 10 years, China has remained Africa's largest trading partner and also the largest export destination for Africa. Across many fronts - be they economic, infrastructure, education and technology, cultural cooperation and security - it is expected that there will be spectacular milestones reached under the joint effort of a China-Africa partnership.As the world enters another chapter of turmoil and mistrust, China has reiterated that Africa is not and should not be the backdrop for a power struggle between the West and Beijing, but that rather, Africa presents a big stage and great potential for international cooperation. Africa already has the largest share of country representation under the China-led BRI, which is building land and sea trade routes to continents around the world. This already sets the stage for repositioning Africa's place and role in international affairs.China, through FOCAC and other multilateral and bilateral frameworks, is helping Africa shine on the global stage, by showing that major powers can have a partnership of equals with vulnerable, poor nations in the South.

140,UNSC has not authorized force against Yemen; China urges all parties concerned to abide by international law: China’s UN envoy,Global Times,2024-01-13,"China opposes any forcible transfer of the Palestine people from the Gaza, and all measures must be taken to alleviate the humanitarian catastrophe and make a cease-fire the most urgent task of the moment, China's permanent representative to the UN Zhang Jun said during a UN conference on Friday local time.An immediate ceasefire has become the overwhelming call of the international community, but a permanent member of UN (UN) has vetoed the consensus reached by the UN in this regard on various grounds, which is a blatant defiance of international fairness, justice and the authority of UN, Zhang said.The UN failed to adopt a draft resolution on December 8, 2023 that would have demanded an immediate humanitarian ceasefire in Gaza due to a veto cast by the US. Many countries expressed disappointment over the US veto of the Gaza-related draft.It is a blatant double standard for some people to talk about the protection of human rights and the prevention of genocide while pretending to be deaf and dumb, covering up and diverting attention from the tragic situation in Gaza, Zhang remarked, ""We must remove all interference and take vigorous action to quell the war, save lives and restore peace.""In addition, Zhang stressed that that any forcible transfer of the Palestine people must be firmly rejected.Over the past three months, millions of Palestine people have been forced to relocate repeatedly and were under constant threat to their lives, said Zhang, noting that China is gravely concerned about the ""voluntary emigration"" of Gaza people, which has been advocated by some Israel politicians.The horrific idea of displacing two million people from Gaza and turning it into a ""safe zone"" devoid of human habitation, if implemented, would constitute a grave crime under international law and completely destroy prospects for the ""Two-State solution,"" Zhang remarked.The China envoy called for all measures to be taken to alleviate the humanitarian catastrophe in the Gaza.Zhang said it was totally unacceptable for Israel to accuse the UN of not having the will and capacity to provide humanitarian relief when it was clear that Israel was accountable for the continued bombing and striking in Gaza and setting obstacles to the entry of humanitarian supplies.He urged Israel to immediately cease its indiscriminate military attacks and destruction of Gaza.UN resolutions 2712 and 2720 must be fully implemented, and Israel must fulfil its obligations as the occupying party to guarantee the safety of humanitarian workers and provide full cooperation with humanitarian relief efforts, Zhang said.The envoy reiterated that a ceasefire must be implemented with the utmost urgency. ""Only a ceasefire can prevent greater civilian casualties and humanitarian disasters and create conditions for the early release of all hostages; only a ceasefire can prevent the complete destruction of the basis of the Two-State solution; and only a ceasefire can prevent the entire Middle East region from being drawn into a catastrophe.""Regarding the recent attacks launched by US and UK on Yemen against the Houthi rebels, which targeted Israel-linked ships in the Red Sea, Zhang expressed concerns about the spillover effects of the Gaza crisis.Zhang said at a UN emergency conference on the Red Sea situation on the same day that the UN has never authorized any country to use force against Yemen. The military action taken by the related countries runs counter to the UN resolution 2722, which the UN has just adopted.The envoy warned that the Middle East region is on the brink of extreme danger, and what should be avoided now is reckless military adventurism. He added that what is needed most of all is calm and restraint to prevent further expansion of the conflict.China urges all parties concerned, especially the influential powers, to abide by the Charter of the UN and international law, adhere to the direction of dialogue and consultation, and make practical efforts to maintain peace and stability in the Red Sea and the Middle East region, Zhang said.The US carried out further strikes against Houthi targets in Yemen on Friday night a day after launching a coordinated multi-nation attack on nearly 30 Houthi locations.Global Times",CHINA,DIPLOMACY,"Zhang Jun, China's permanent representative to the UN.

142,Can budget deficit and coming elections in US contribute to mitigation in Ukraine?,Andrey Gubin,2024-01-12,"As a result of their economic shocks and social and political unrest, the US and the EU have drastically reduced financial support for Ukraine. Washington and Brussels fearlessly restate their commitments to Kiev and declare belief in the earliest possible victory over Russia, despite the obvious circumstances. Moscow calls for negotiations, but the fundamental objectives of its special military operation are unwavering. Can budget deficit and coming elections in the US contribute to mitigation in Ukraine?The majority of NATO nations and their allies in the Pacific, who make up the global West, believe that Russia's actions toward Ukraine in February 2022 are what started the current global crisis. However, far more crucial points are humbly retouched, like several waves of NATO's expansion and its unilateral assault against Serbia in 1999. Those events triggered a significant upheaval in security domain.In late January or early February, the EU will try again to reach an agreement on financial support for Ukraine, since they were unable to approve a four-year financial agreement worth 50 billion euros in December 2023. It will be difficult to get the approval of all members. Surprisingly, the EU Commission tied Kiev's financial help to EU fiscal obligations, sparking heated discussions. In particular, Germany and the Netherlands were unwilling to use their government money to support the EU. Slovakia, like Hungary before it, stopped sending military supplies to Ukraine in October 2023. Finally, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban delayed the next EU aid package, which undermined the unity position and stoked discontent. Since February 2022, more than $38 billion in direct military support to Ukraine was pledged by all member states of the EU, according to CNN. However, only 843 million euros had been allocated for humanitarian purposes. Literally, nearly all of the money goes into the coffers of EU arms producers and mediators, with a small portion going to NGOs and local authorities. A sizable number of weapons supplied by EU nations have reportedly turned up in conflict areas in the Middle East, Central Africa and other regions of the world. There are still crazies in EU who demand that the Ukraine military use more deadly weapons. For example, some Germany lawmakers are adamant about giving Kiev 500-kilometer-range Taurus cruise missiles. Such a claim is more of a cynical attempt to push Taurus on the international arms market than it is a simple bloodlust, given that its nearest rival, Storm Shadow/SCALP, is being actively employed in combat. The US Congress has not been able to come to a consensus on additional funding for Ukraine since September 2023. The all-inclusive proposal includes $106 billion to defend US interests in the Indo-Pacific, strengthen the border with Mexico, and assist Israel and Ukraine. This appears overly broad and blatantly abundant for the majority of Republican. Furthermore, Republican ultimately abandoned a plea for $61 billion after mostly rejecting Zelensky's request to meet in December. President Joe Biden consequently asserted that the US' ability to assist Ukraine was almost at an end and provided a mere $200 million from his sources. Congress shows more concern about drug trafficking, illegal immigration and violent crime as elections draw nearer since these issues require significant attention and resources than either Israel or Ukraine. Former US president Donald Trump has declined to commit to continuing military assistance for Ukraine following his victory in the 2024 campaign, and has said he will simply solve the conflict ""in 24 hours."" All opinions that Washington's policy toward Russia will improve following the US' 2024 presidential election are real but a little narrow-minded. The US is not governed by a single president, but rather by a deep state made up of rival groups of capitalist raptors. For them, profit rationale dominates. Democrats anticipate engagement with Russia in negative negotiations until the end of 2024.  Nevertheless, America is likely to be distant from the war for this year until domestic issues are mitigated. This is clear by the diminished number of capable arms in recent support packages. In addition, resistance is currently there in EU; it began with the budget deficit and appears to have culminated in an awareness of the ridiculousness of continuing the struggle. So, both the US and the EU are leaning toward freezing the conflict, and the spirit of the 1953 Korean armistice scenario is repeatedly summoned by foreign experts. But Moscow's position is firm. The goal is achieved when the West agrees on Ukraine's neutrality. Without legal framework and guarantees of non-remilitarization, even more severe conflict would be ignited afterwards. The best option for the West is to allow Russia to carry on without global ambitions and significant power, but with abundant cheap energy and spacious market. It worked somehow after the collapse of the Soviet Union and unlikely to be resumed ever again. No concessions can still be expected from either the US or the EU in 2024, one possible outcome is their acquiescence of Russia's designed status quo.The author is an associate professor at the International Relations Department, Far Eastern Federal University, and adjunct-professor at the North-East Asia Research Center, Jilin University. opinion@globaltimes.com.cn",OPINION,VIEWPOINT,Illustration: Chen Xia/GT,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'US': ('LOC', 2), 'Ukraine': ('LOC', 7), 'Washington': ('LOC', 1), 'Brussels': ('LOC', 1), 'Kiev': ('LOC', 3), 'Russia': ('LOC', 2), 'Moscow': ('LOC', 1), 'Pacific': ('LOC', 1), 'West': ('LOC', 1), 'Serbia': ('LOC', 1), 'Germany': ('LOC', 2), 'Netherlands': ('LOC', 1), 'Slovakia': ('LOC', 1), 'Hungary': ('LOC', 1), 'Middle East': ('LOC', 1), 'Africa': ('LOC', 1), 'EU': ('ORG', 9), 'NATO': ('ORG', 2), 'EU Commission': ('ORG', 10), 'CNN': ('ORG', 1), 'Hungarian': ('MISC', 1), 'Viktor Orban': ('PER', 1)}"
143,Impossible to restore peace to the Red Sea via military means: Global Times editorial,Global Times,2024-01-12,"US and UK fighter jets launched strikes against multiple targets in Yemen's capital Sanaa, the West Red Sea city of Al Hudaydah and the northern province of Saada on Friday local time. The situation in the Red Sea has seen a new round of increased tensions and faces the risk of further escalation.The air strikes took place exactly one day after the UN passed a resolution regarding the situation in the Red Sea, giving the impression that the UN resolution gave the green light for the US and UK actions. It must be pointed out that this is an illusion. The US and the UK may have deliberately created and strengthened this illusion, but it is far from the truth. The resolution was proposed by the US and Japan and passed with a vote of 11 in favor to none against, with four abstentions. It demanded ""that the Houthis immediately cease all such attacks, which impede global commerce and undermine navigational rights and freedoms as well as regional peace and security."" Russia, China, Algeria and Mozambique abstained from the vote.The Red Sea is an important international trade channel for goods and energy, and its stability is related to the common interests of the international community. China emphasized that ""No country should misinterpret or abuse relevant provisions in this resolution to create new tensions in the Red Sea."" Unexpectedly, what China was worried about became a reality the next day. After the attack, some US allies in the Middle East, including Jordan and Oman, expressed concern that the situation might get out of control. Yemen's neighbor Saudi Arabia also called for avoiding escalation of the situation. There is also a lot of opposition in the US. Nabeel Khoury, former deputy chief of mission at the US embassy in Yemen, said on X (formerly Twitter), ""US/UK bombing campaign in Yemen is another failure of Joe Biden diplomacy.""The current situation in the region is dire. A cease-fire between Palestine and Israel has not yet been achieved, and the spillover conflict in the Red Sea is further escalating and expanding. The Supreme Political Committee of the Houthi armed forces of Yemen claimed that all ""interests"" of the US and Britain are now ""legitimate targets."" Retaliation and harassment against the US and the UK will start another cycle of attacks, and multiple spillover conflicts are possible. In short, the possibility of the situation deteriorating has increased and deepened, and this outcome requires all parties to do their best to avoid it.It needs to be said that the development of the situation to this point has been both accidental and inevitable. It is the US that has pushed the situation to the current stage step by step according to its own style and behavioral logic. The skewed stance of the US in the Palestinian-Israeli Conflict has led to the conflict becoming protracted and caused spillovers. When dealing with Middle East issues, which are intertwined with contradictions and have complex historical latitudes, the US' strategy is thoughtless, even crude.Military means is still the most familiar, preferred and convenient method for the US. It has been used in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and Syria and now against the Houthi armed forces in Yemen. The US has become quite dependent on it. Many bloody lessons have taught us that force as the main means cannot solve the problem, but instead makes the situation worse and more complicated. Ultimately, we have to return to the path of political settlement. The same is true for the Palestinian-Israeli Conflict. China has repeatedly stressed the urgency of achieving an immediate cease-fire in Gaza, and it is the overriding prerequisite for everything else and a top priority for international diplomatic efforts.Whether it is the current Red Sea crisis or the protracted conflict in Gaza, the real solution to the problem has always been clear, which is to immediately implement a cease-fire in Gaza. But for this core demand, the US currently does not have the courage to truly take supportive action. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has made four trips to the Middle East in three months. He has made so many trips, but he can't even say the word ""instant cease-fire."" If Washington continues on its current path, it will not solve the Middle East problem, but will become an active promoter of risk proliferation.US defense officials said the strike was intended to thread the needle - pressing the Houthis to quit their attacks without spurring more conflicts in the volatile region. Threading the needle can be regarded as progress in US thinking, but can it achieve this via force? Can this restore peace in the Red Sea? The answer is obviously no.",OPINION,EDITORIAL,An explosion is seen in Yemen's capital Sanaa after US and UK fighter jets launch strikes on January 12 local time.

144,"China abstains UNSC resolution over Red Sea crisis, concerned over ‘fueling tensions’",Zhang Han,2024-01-11,"China, along with Algeria, Mozambique and Russia, abstained on a US-backed UN (UN) resolution demanding Houthi militia stop attacks on commercial ships in the Red Sea, which was adopted on Wednesday with 11 voting for and zero against. Zhang Jun, China's permanent representative to the UN, explained China's abstention as certain revisions proposed by UN members were not incorporated into the text.Defeated amendments included adding ""the text's provisions should not be seen to create precedent or new norms of international law,"" changes to language regarding the defense of vessels and contents relating to the conflict in the Gaza, according to a press release by the UN. The text remains ambiguous on several key issues and Zhang expressed concern that the resolution might not achieve its intended effect, or might even lead to negative consequences and further escalate regional tensions. Stating that his delegation therefore had to abstain, Zhang called on the Houthi militia to abide by the resolution and on relevant parties to play a constructive role to ease tensions in the Red Sea.Liu Zhongmin, a professor at the Middle East Studies Institute of Shanghai International Studies University, told the Globala Times on Thursday that a major flaw of the resolution lay in the fact that it treated the Red Sea crisis as a separate issue while it was obviously a spillover of the Palestinian-Israeli Conflict.Targeting Houthi militia without substantial efforts to de-escalate the Gaza war is like putting the cart before the horse, he said. The US formed a so-called international coalition in December 2023 to deal with Houthi attacks and the fighting has been escalating. On Tuesday, US Central Command said the US and British navies downed 21 missiles and drones launched by Houthi forces, according to media reports.In response to the UN resolution, the head of Yemen's Houthi supreme revolutionary committee, Mohammed Ali al-Houthi, said on Thursday that what armed forces in Yemen were doing comes within the framework of legitimate defense, and that any action they confront will be met with a reaction. Liu raised concerns that the US and its coalition may use the resolution to justify expanded strikes on Houthi group. The US may not intend to get deeply involved in the Red Sea crisis as it is not ""cost-efficient,"" but its approach is aggravating tensions. The prolonged Gaza war has led to not only the Red Sea crisis but also an Israel-Lebanon conflict at the borders, among other regional sporadic conflicts.Liu said US pressure on Houthi group and diplomatic posturing to media in the Gaza war without substantial efforts will only cause the intertwined conflicts in the region to last longer and become more complicated. If the situation continues, the entire Middle East will ultimately face a dire security prospect and likely spikes in extremism and terrorism, Liu warned.  Given these longer-term prospects and the immediate impact on energy prices and global trade, it is ridiculous to claim China is benefiting from Middle East instability when it is the US that is trying to reaffirm its hegemony in the region, analysts said. China has had a consistent stance that related parties should act with restraint and capable powers should play constructive roles rather than fan the flames, they said.",CHINA,DIPLOMACY,"A ship transits the Suez Canal towards the Red Sea on January 10, 2024 in Ismailia, Egypt.

145,"Because of the US, the world is entering ‘the Voldemort of years’",Global Times,2024-01-11,"""Politically, 2024 is the Voldemort of years,"" reads the latest report issued by Eurasia Group, a US-based global political risk research and consulting firm.In its annual report, ""Top Risks for 2024,"" released on Monday, Eurasia Group provided the reason for this view: Three wars will dominate world affairs in 2024: Russia vs. Ukraine, Israel vs. Hamas, and the US vs. itself. The top three global risks listed in the report are ""the US vs. itself,"" ""Middle East on the brink"" and ""Partitioned Ukraine.""In other words, the world is entering a year of grave concern - ""the Voldemort of years"" because of the US, as all three top risks are related to the US. It's fair to say the US is the source of global risks in 2024.According to Eurasia Group's report, US public trust in core institutions - such as Congress, the judiciary, and the media - is at historic lows; polarization and partisanship are at historic highs. The report said that if the current Republican candidate, Donald Trump, loses to incumbent President Joe Biden in the next election, he will allege mass fraud once again and ""incite widespread intimidation campaigns"" against election workers and secretaries of state in both red and blue states. At the same time, Joe Biden would be 86 years old at the end of his second term. ""The vast majority of US want neither to lead the nation.""The US election has now become an either-or choice between ""worse"" and ""the worst."" US are helpless, yet they have no better choices. The election risk is rooted in the internal political division within the US, and the conflict of interests between the Democratic and Republican Parties has reached an irreconcilable point. The current political system in the US cannot bridge such contradictions and conflicts, leading to a political deadlock, which means that whoever takes office will not have the ability to point out a path for the US, Lü Xiang, a research fellow at the China Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times.With the increasing polarization and social division in US politics, some polls show that US have a more open attitude toward using violence to achieve political goals. The US has increasingly become ""the United States of Political Violence."" Now, the US has become a country that makes the world worry. ""When a country's internal risks reach a certain level, it is highly likely that the conflict will spill over. The US wants to shift its risks to other countries and divert domestic attention, making other countries share the pressure of its internal issues. This is terrifying,"" Lü said.Regarding the other two top risks faced by the world mentioned in the report, the Russia-Ukraine war and the Gaza war, the US also bears an undeniable responsibility.The US' push for NATO's eastward expansion directly led to the outbreak of the Russia-Ukraine war and the US has acted as the biggest hurdle to a ceasefire. Michael von der Schulenburg, a former UN Assistant Secretary-General revealed at the end of 2023 that ""just one month after the start of the Russia military intervention in Ukraine, Ukraine and Russia negotiators had come very close to an agreement for a ceasefire and to an outline for a comprehensive peace solution to the conflict."" But ""these peace negotiations failed due to resistance from NATO and in particular from the US and the UK. The reason is that such a peace agreement would have been tantamount to a defeat for NATO, an end to NATO's eastward expansion, and thus an end to the dream of a unipolar world dominated by the US."" In 2024, the US and some other West countries may experience ""Ukraine fatigue"" to some extent in terms of providing aid to Ukraine, but due to the need to maintain their geopolitical advantage, it is expected that they will continue to use Ukraine as a pawn to engage in fierce competition with Russia.On another battlefield, Gaza, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken held a meeting with Israel leaders in Tel Aviv on Tuesday. However, the US has consistently maintained its ""taking sides"" stance. And the US has never truly had the intention and capacity to promote peace.The US is indeed the source of global risks. What is even more tragic is that even though the Eurasia Group predicted future risks, we still cannot avoid them. Furthermore, US think tanks, consulting firms, and politicians have shown little interest in restricting US' destructive actions on the world.At present, one of the core objectives for countries around the world to engage with the US should be to avoid the US bringing more risks to the world, said Li Haidong, a professor at the China Foreign Affairs University.",OPINION,OBSERVER,Illustration: Liu Xidan/GT,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'Voldemort of': ('MISC', 2), 'Republican': ('MISC', 1), 'Democratic': ('MISC', 1), 'Republican Parties': ('MISC', 2), 'Eurasia Group': ('ORG', 3), 'Hamas': ('ORG', 1), 'Congress': ('ORG', 1), 'US': ('LOC', 17), 'Russia': ('LOC', 1), 'Israel': ('LOC', 1), 'Middle East': ('LOC', 1), 'Partitioned Ukraine': ('LOC', 2), 'China': ('LOC', 1), 'United States': ('LOC', 1), 'Donald Trump': ('PER', 1), 'Joe Biden': ('PER', 2), 'Xi': ('PER', 1)}"

150,US attempt at global domination no longer sustainable,Global Times,2024-01-10,"Editor's Note:The label of the ""China threat"" is itself an effort by the US to undermine China and sustain US dominance in the world. Joseph Solis-Mullen (Solis-Mullen), a political scientist and economist at the Libertarian Institute, recently published a book titled The Fake China Threat and Its Very Real Danger to debunk the myth of this fabricated theory. In an interview with Global Times (Global Times) reporter Wang Wenwen, Solis-Mullen talked about why he wrote this book and the danger of this narrative to the US itself.Global Times: How did you become interested in China?Solis-Mullen: My educational background is very diverse. I'm a political scientist, an economist, and a professor of history. I was preparing to do some non-West history courses several years ago, especially focusing on China. I read the corporate press every day, such as the Wall Street Journal and Washington Post. I started to notice that the tone of the coverage was changing. You no longer come across references to China as a strategic partner or a pillar of the rules-based order.. You started seeing China portrayed more as a threat, and it got worse and worse. Even if you do a Google search, you can find that the different adjectives that are used to describe China have varied significantly over time, when really there hasn't been a great deal of change in the behavior of China toward its neighbors.From my own perspective, the unipolar moment in the latter half of the 20th century was an anomaly in history. The US has got to learn how to live with and deal with large, powerful states who do not acquiesce to US security prerogatives. As I started reading everything I could about China, I found a cottage industry had grown up of books talking about how threatening China was. When I looked into the background of these people, most of them were being paid by the weapons manufacturers in our own country. And then they write books and articles about how we're in such great danger from Russia or China, anything that seems to justify buying more of their weapons.We have this complex here that doesn't really serve the US people's interest. I felt that this narrative was being consumed by these hawks who were desperate to fight someone to justify the continuation of the militarized foreign policy that America has adopted increasingly.Global Times: Why did you write the book?Solis-Mullen: I was trying to speak to people who are genuinely terrified, because they don't really know anything about China. China looks large. It's very strong and powerful. China is relatively much stronger than it was. It's much wealthier than it was and is growing. But I think that people just need to calm down and look at the facts, such as China's strategic situation and its economic situation.Historically, large regional powers try to dominate their region. The US is no exception. So I think it's a case of looking in the mirror and not projecting what you see onto China. I try to explain to people in the book that China's military doctrine is based on area denial to try and keep people out of China's immediate space. The US' own policy is the one that's based on global domination. The US is prepared to fight a war anywhere over anything at any time. That is not the capacity that China is building up. Realistically, our government is bankrupting itself. It's only a matter of time before this attempt at global domination is no longer sustainable.

Joseph Solis-Mullen Photo: Courtesy of Solis-MullenGT: How dangerous is this ""China threat"" theory that is prevailing in the US? Why is it necessary to dispel this myth?Solis-Mullen: It's very dangerous. If a conflict happens - people always say it won't go nuclear. First of all, you don't know that it won't go nuclear. And even if we say it will stay below the nuclear threshold, conventional wars between major powers are horrifying. My grandfather fought in one, my father experienced a more minor but equally serious conflict. These are horrible. We're talking about potentially millions of people dying. It's horribly dangerous, especially because it would be a fight over the Taiwan question, and it would be a fight the US could not win. In the 1970s this was all set down. Beijing is the government of China, and Taiwan is part of China. These agreements were made. Our entire relationship is built on these agreements being carried out in good faith. Now, Washington has decided, ""We don't really like those agreements anymore."" But I know America's security is not served by fighting over Taiwan. Our economic prosperity is not dependent on Taiwan. In fact, what our economic prosperity is dependent on is there being no war. War does not make us rich. And a conflict over the Taiwan question involving Beijing and Washington would be especially horribly disruptive to the global economy. Global Times: How can US society bridge the understanding deficit of China?Solis-Mullen: Unfortunately, they only have access to books and media that come out from people who are willing to pay to have the books written and who have a vested commercial monetary interest. As is always the case, the peace caucus and the caucus for reason is very small, because what we have here is a problem of concentrated benefits and very diffuse costs. It costs all of us about $25 a month. But it's worth billions of dollars to these companies and to these Congress people who literally don't even read the bills that they sign. That's the level of tragedy that we're at right now. Global Times: After your book was published, what feedback did you get? Do you get more criticism or praise?Solis-Mullen: I got 50-50. Some people said ""thank you so much for saying that,"" while others - I just got an email recently from someone just going off about it. Most of the stuff that people come with is super alarmist, like ""the CPC is trying to take over America and hook all US on drugs and steal all our farmland."" But actually, various China entities own less than 1 percent of all US farmland, and it's a smart investment. And then deindustrialization policies and the fentanyl thing. They say China stole all the jobs. That's so crazy. Maybe Washington's policies were what deindustrialized the country. Maybe it was Washington's policies that started a drug epidemic in the country. The US always needs someone to blame for all its bad policies.Most people are just not going to change their minds even when you present them with facts. The number of people who can have a conversation and be convinced by the other is very small. Most of them are in actual academia, which is where I work. It's definitely tough because the average person in the US is very upset over a variety of things, such as inflation and cost of living. Washington is desperate to blame anyone else for anything, to distract them with anything. Global Times: With wars being launched by the US or where the US was involved in wars, do you think US rhetoric, such as democracy and human rights, has lost its appeal?Solis-Mullen: If you look at where the US was at the end of the Cold War versus where we are now, all the wars we fought made us less safe, killed lots of people and made us look bad.At the same time, public opinion needed to be manipulated. We needed to be lied into these wars, which made democracy look bad. Washington has made its own brand look bad. We'd be in a lot better spot right now if we had not entered into these wars, geopolitically and economically. Economically we would be doing much better. Military spending is almost a total bust except for the handful of companies and their shareholders who benefit.There are reasons the wars were actually fought, but it wasn't for human rights and democracy. The Middle East wars, apart from trying to help Israel, which totally backfired, were fought so that the US could maintain a presence in the Middle East to control access to the oil supply. Not because we need oil. We here in America have tons of oil and we get most of what we import from Canada and Mexico. It was to be able to shut off the oil in the event of a conflict with China or someone else.Now regarding the Russia-Ukraine war: The wars in the Middle East got US used to this idea of war just going on in the background and going on forever, like the war in Afghanistan that went on for 20 years. We cannot tolerate Washington doing things like that to major powers like Russia. It is dangerous and unacceptable. Ukraine is not vital to US national security. Washington has already provoked a new cold war, and like the first it is going hot all over the place, putting us all at risk and over things far from central to our own security but paramount for that of Russia. Washington's policy in that regard has been a total disaster and failure. But look what the ex-ambassador to Russia, Michael McFaul, still a prominent commentator and academic, said the other day. He indicated that sanctions didn't work, but then his very next sentence was ""we need more sanctions, better sanctions, and better implementation."" Sanctions didn't break Cuba, Iran or Venezuela. Are they supposed to break Russia or China? These policies are a bust, and it is up to US to start demanding new and better ones, ones geared toward cooperation and the prosperity of all, not attempted global hegemony.",OPINION,VIEWPOINT,Illustration: Xia Qing/GT,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'China': ('LOC', 11), 'US': ('LOC', 6), 'Russia': ('LOC', 1), 'America': ('LOC', 1), 'Joseph Solis - Mullen': ('PER', 7), 'Wang Wenwen': ('PER', 1), 'Libertarian Instituteake China': ('ORG', 1), 'Global Times': ('ORG', 4), 'Wall Street Journal': ('ORG', 1), 'Washington Post': ('ORG', 1), 'non': ('MISC', 1), 'West': ('MISC', 1), 'Google': ('MISC', 1)}"

152,"Hope for US first moon landing in 50 yrs crashes, hindering Artemis program",Fan Anqi,2024-01-09," The hope for US' first moon landing in more than 50 years has appeared to have crashed, after a US private company's spacecraft reported ""critical fuel leak"" hours after Monday's launch. Experts said the failed attempt suggests that commercial space sector still faces challenges in breaking through the threshold of deep space exploration, and could impact the US Artemis program, which faces even more obstacles along the way following several delays and launch failures.The lunar lander, named Peregrine and developed by Pittsburgh-based Astrobotic Technology, encountered abnormalities shortly after a successful lift-off from Florida. Ground research teams found the spacecraft unable to place itself in a position facing the sun, which prevented it from charging its batteries, CNN reported.Shortly after the spacecraft became fully operational, it soon became apparent that there was ""a critical loss of fuel,"" further diminishing the chances of a scheduled lunar landing on February 23. This is the first lunar mission undertaken by the US since the Apollo 17 mission in 1972, and also the first time that a private company has taken on this task.According to media reports, NASA gave a $108 million funding to the private company to develop Peregrine, which aims to fulfill the space agency's vision to reduce the cost of lunar missions by asking the private sector to compete for such contracts. Song Zhongping, a space analyst and TV commentator, said the US' adoption of a commercial model for deep space exploration is commendable, as it could indicate a more sustainable development path. The encouragement of private capital to enter the aerospace industry has led to the flourishing development of private space ventures in the US in recent years, and has fostered a healthy cycle of competition, cooperation, and technological collaboration among various players in the industry, the expert told the Global Times on Tuesday.However, some experts pointed out the pickle of this model. As a project is usually co-developed by several ventures, there is a wide gap in the technological capabilities among them with many still insufficient to support such deep-space endeavors, Wang Ya'nan, chief editor of Beijing-based Aerospace Knowledge magazine, told the Global Times on Tuesday.  ""Lunar explorations are highly complex. It involves precise trajectory selection, stringent spacecraft design, and the ultimate hurdle of a soft landing on the lunar surface. Peregrine's failed attempt also sounded the alarm that commercial enterprises may still lack technological feasibility to achieve such feats,"" Wang said. By far, only four countries have made it to the Moon, namely the Soviet Union, the US, China, and India. Since the 21st century, only China and Indian spacecrafts successfully landed on the lunar surface, while others from Israel, Russia and Japan all crashed.While the Peregrine mission is considered part of the wider Artemis program with NASA placing several flying experiments onboard, experts said it is unlikely to cause major setbacks for NASA, but could hint at even more obstacles along the way, after experiencing repeated delays of the Space Launch System (SLS) rocket launch and the failed liftoff of SpaceX's Starship rocket. Song called for the US to abandon its Cold War mentality and open up its arms to cooperate with China, as the latter can offer a variety of assistances to its grand lunar return, for example, crucial scientific data from the previously retrieved lunar soils by the Chang'e-5 mission. In December 2023, NASA greenlighted and urged scientists it funds to apply for access to China's Chang'e-5 lunar samples in an exception to the Wolf Amendment, which prohibits such bilateral activities with China. ""The Wolf Amendment is originally intended to create barriers for latecomers. However, time has proven that it has not hindered China who has been following its own path through independent innovation. With China's research capabilities constantly advancing, it can be said that China is at least on par with or even partly ahead of the US in certain fields, including lunar exploration,"" Wang noted.""Eventually, the clause only ends up a constraint on their own development. In fact, many from the scientific community in the US are questioning the necessity of this clause,"" the expert said.",CHINA,SOCIETY,"The brand new rocket, United Launch Alliance's (ULA) Vulcan Centaur, lifts off from Space Launch Complex 41d at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Cape Canaveral, Florida, on January 8, 2024, for its maiden voyage, carrying Astrobotic's Peregrine Lunar Lander.

153,"Blinken's fifth Israel visit since Gaza war for diplomatic posture, rather than real mediation: experts",Zhang Han,2024-01-09,"US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, after touring multiple Saudi Arabia countries, is meeting Israel leaders on Tuesday amid the enduring Gaza humanitarian disaster, Houthi attacks on Red Sea shipping and the escalation in hostilities at the Israel-Lebanon borders.Speaking alongside Israel President Isaac Herzog ahead of their meeting on Tuesday, Blinken said he would share what he had heard from regional countries during a day of meetings with Israel's government, including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Reuters reported.Blinken's agenda for his fifth Israel visit in three months includes discussing the next phase of Israel's military campaign and pressing on the protection of civilians, according to the US Department of State. But China observers have low expectations that Blinken's trip can help alleviate the tension, as Israel shows no signs of softening its military assertiveness while the US eyes a diplomatic posture rather than real mediation. Since Friday, Blinken has visited countries including Turkey, Jordan, Qatar, the United Saudi Arabia Emirates and Saudi Arabia. During the trip, he repeated multiple times the urgency of de-escalating the tension and discussed plans for the future governance of Gaza. On Monday, Blinken said Palestine ""must not be pressed to leave Gaza"" and he criticized ""irresponsible"" comments by some Israel ministers calling for people's resettlement outside the enclave, media reported.Yet US calls may only get symbolic resonation from Israel as the two close allies are diverging wider and wider on Gaza and Middle East issues, Zhu Yongbiao, executive director of the Research Center for the Belt and Road at Lanzhou University, told the Global Times on Tuesday. Israel officials said the strikes in Gaza have entered a new phase of more targeted warfare, but there was no respite in the fighting on Monday, Reuters reported. ""The fighting will continue through 2024,"" said Daniel Hagari, an Israel military spokesperson, Reuters reported. Sun Degang, director of the Center for Middle Eastern Studies at Fudan University, told the Global Times that Israel aims to use its recent victories as leverage to address security concerns in the north and potentially extend its military achievements. The US has to deal with the presidential election this year and does not want the Middle East to take up too much of its attention from its competition with China and Russia, Sun said. Zhu pointed out that under the US' guideline of withdrawing from the Middle East, Blinken's trip aims to display the US' diplomatic presence and fulfillment of responsibilities as Israel's ally rather than play a constructive role in mediation. Therefore the US and Israel could showcase they have reached some consensus on non-significant topics, but that consensus can hardly have meaningful impact on the overall conflicts raging in the region, Zhu said. In the latest sign that the war may be spreading, Israel killed a top commander of Hamas' ally Hezbollah in south Lebanon on Monday. It came after an attack in Beirut last week which killed Hamas leader Saleh al-Arouri, for which Israel did not claim responsibility, according to CNN. Israel Defense Minister Yoav Gallant warned on Monday that if Hezbollah is not deterred, Israel can ""copy-paste"" the Gaza war to Beirut. Gallant told media that his country was determined to end Hamas' rule of Gaza and deter other Iran-backed adversaries, Reuters reported. Hezbollah has vowed revenge, and analysts believe there will be more rocket launches, but a ""large-scale retaliatory assault"" is unlikely as it is beyond regional forces' capacity and will.However, the possibility cannot be ruled out that there might be actions internationalizing the consequences of the Palestinian-Israeli Conflict conflict, such as Houthi attacks on vessels in the Red Sea, Zhu said.",CHINA,SOCIETY,"US Secretary of State Antony Blinken walks on the day of meetings with Israeli ministers in Tel Aviv, Israel,January 9, 2024.

154,"China’s diplomacy will stabilize 2024, while US diplomacy worries world",Global Times,2024-01-09,"2023 witnessed a series of highlights and achievements in China's diplomacy. China's major-country diplomacy with China characteristics is expected to inject more stability into 2024, while in contrast, US diplomacy's uncertainty is increasingly worrying the world.On Tuesday, Member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Foreign Minister Wang Yi attended and delivered a speech at the opening ceremony of a symposium on the international situation and China's diplomacy in 2023. In his speech, Wang called 2023 ""a year of exploration and harvest for China's diplomacy.""2023 was a crucial year for China's diplomacy, which advanced steadily and pragmatically. Looking back on it, China's diplomacy achieved some remarkable breakthroughs in new areas. In particular, as a member of the Global South, China strengthened closer coordination with other developing countries, from brokering a rapprochement between Saudi Arabia and Iran, holding the first-ever China-Central Asia Summit, to successfully pushing for the historic expansion of the BRICS.In addition, China has also reaped the fruits of the seeds of peaceful development planted years ago. The China-proposed BRI and the concept of ""a global community of shared future"" both entered their 10th year last year since their proposal and have entered a new phase of development based on steady construction. And regarding relations with other major countries and global players, under the strategic guidance of head-of-state diplomacy, China in 2023 continued to see a deepening relationship with Russia, while its ties with the US and EU have moved toward stability.These highlights demonstrate distinct China characteristics, style, and ethos, and speak to China's enhanced international influence, stronger capacity to steer new endeavors, and greater moral appeal in the new era, said Wang.The pillar of these outstanding achievements is major-country diplomacy with China characteristics that Beijing has adopted for many years. Cui Hongjian, a professor with the Academy of Regional and Global Governance at Beijing Foreign Studies University, told the Global Times that major-country diplomacy with China characteristics emphasizes that China's diplomacy should reflect the unique characteristics of China's national conditions and inherit the country and its people's historical and cultural genes, such as the pursuit of peace and harmony.On the other hand, major-country diplomacy with China characteristics focuses on how China understands its diplomatic tasks as a major country. In other words, the country believes that a major country needs to take on more responsibilities in global affairs, not fight for more benefits for itself or bully other countries.During its implementation, major-country diplomacy with China characteristics has kept adapting to the changes in the international situation and made contributions to the world. It is precisely because of the very existence of such ""constant adjustments"" that China's diplomacy is believed to inject stability into the year 2024 and continue to contribute to world peace, stability and prosperity.According to Cui, China's diplomacy could do many things in 2024. As the conflicts in Ukraine and the Gaza have entered a critical period this year, China can put forward more concrete proposals based on its position of promoting a cease-fire. It is also expected to push for cooperation with other major global players based on stable ties and show more room for maneuvering with its neighbors and other developing countries.In contrast to China's prominent diplomatic achievements, US diplomacy last year not only appeared increasingly feebler due to the constraints of domestic issues, but also maintained its posture of seeking to profit from the chaos and tensions.In the face of China's rise, the US' containment reached a new peak in 2023, ranging from instigating the Philippines against China over South China Sea disputes, enhancing the cooperation with South Korea and Japan to counter ""challenges from China,"" to building a ""smaller yard, higher fence"" in fields such as semiconductors, quantum computing and artificial intelligence to strangle China's development.In addition, after the escalation of the Palestine-Israel conflict in October, the US has repeatedly stood against the international community that seeks peace in the Middle East. By condoning the continuation of the war, it doesn't have the slightest sense of responsibility as a world power, but only shows ""partiality"" and ""double standards.""Judging from the current circumstances in the country, US diplomacy will only become more worrying to the international community this year. Experts believe it may be difficult or even impossible for Washington to make any strong diplomatic move, since the presidential election later this year will dominate US politics all year and influence Washington's diplomatic choice. Yet, since what path will the country take after this election is still uncertain, US diplomacy is and will continue to be a destabilizing factor in how the world develops in the foreseeable future.",OPINION,OBSERVER,"Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi, also a member of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China Central Committee, addresses the symposium on the international situation and China's foreign relations in 2023 in Beijing, capital of China, Jan. 9, 2024.

156,Prospects of China-Africa cooperation in 2024 bright and promising,Global Times,2024-01-08," Editor's Note:In 2023, the world witnessed significant changes and turbulence. As we have entered 2024, we conducted in-depth interviews with leading strategists from various countries and regions to gather their perspectives on the prominent global issues of 2023 and China's role in addressing them as well as their expectations for China in 2024.In the fifth and final piece of the series, Erastus Mwencha (Mwencha), former deputy chairperson of the African Union (AU) Commission, shared his thoughts with Global Times (Global Times) reporter Xia Wenxin on China's diplomacy, the AU's role in global governance as well as his hopes for China-Africa relations for the new year.Global Times: Looking back at 2023, what diplomatic achievements of China have impressed you the most?Mwencha: China has made several notable diplomatic achievements in 2023. For example, China has brokered significant diplomatic breakthroughs, including a peace deal between Saudi Arabia and Iran. This move has been seen as a demonstration of China's growing influence on the global stage. In 2023, China has continued to reject bloc confrontation and zero-sum competition, maintaining strategic stability in relations with other major countries. The meeting between President Xi Jinping and President Joe Biden in San Francisco was highly successful, as was the hosting of the Third Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation and China's participation in the BRICS Summit in South Africa.Additionally, in 2023, President Xi Jinping proposed the Global Civilization Initiative which was warmly welcomed by the international community, as it advocates respect for the diversity of civilizations, the common values of humanity and robust people-to-people cooperation. In general, China's three initiatives - Global Development Initiative, Global Security Initiative and Global Civilization Initiative - have gained traction among the states involved, and they also underpin China's soft foreign policy. Regionally, China initiated a series of plans in 2023 aimed at supporting Africa's industrialization and agricultural development strategies. These achievements reflect China's active role in global diplomacy and its efforts to maintain strategic stability in its international relations.Global Times: How do you see China's role in helping resolve the Russia-Ukraine and Palestine-Israel conflicts?Mwencha: For the Russia-Ukraine conflict, early in 2022 China issued a position paper for ending the war and brokering peace. China's special envoy Li Hui conducted a 12-day tour through EU, meeting with officials in Ukraine, Poland, France, Germany and the EU Union headquarters in Brussels. China has stated its interest in promoting communication toward resolving the conflict. As for the Israel-Palestine conflict, China's stance on it is quite clear: It advocates a two-state solution and argues that the Palestine people are fighting for national rights. It has repeatedly stated that the question of Palestine needs to be resolved as soon as possible, and the establishment of an independent Palestine state is the only way to solve the question. This is very much in line with the AU's position.Global Times: The Palestine-Israel conflict can be considered a ""black swan event"" in 2023. What event do you predict to be a ""black swan"" or ""grey rhino"" in 2024? Where do you predict the next hotspot to be that deserves our attention?Mwencha: Predicting such events is not easy, as they are often influenced by many factors and uncertainties. But the results of the US elections, especially if Donald Trump wins the presidential election, could be a black swan event. His stand on major global topics, including climate change, protectionism and democracy, is at variance with almost all regions in the world.Global Times: How have the three global initiatives proposed by China contributed to global governance? Mwencha: Global governance faces many challenges in the 21st century. These three initiatives have contributed to global governance by providing China's perspectives and solutions and demonstrating China's willingness and responsibility to play a constructive role in the world. They also aim to enhance cooperation and dialogue among different countries and regions and build mutual trust and understanding among different cultures and civilizations. Moreover, they support the multilateral system and the role of the UN and uphold the principles of equality, openness, inclusiveness and win-win cooperation.There is a need to continue to promote the implementation of these three initiatives, because they are consistent with the common interests and aspirations of the international community, and reflect the trend of the times and the direction of history. They are conducive to the improvement and reform of the global governance system and the creation of a more just and equitable international order. Also, they are beneficial to the advancement of human civilization and the well-being of all people, and the realization of the vision of a global community of shared future. Global Times: Achieving modernization is an important goal of national governance in developing countries. What aspects of China modernization can inspire African countries?Mwencha: I think China modernization can inspire African countries in, first of all, finding a suitable development path. China modernization shows that there is no one-size-fits-all model for development, and each country should choose a path that suits its own national conditions and realities. African countries can learn from China's experience, but also explore their own ways of development based on their own history, culture and aspirations.Second, China modernization aims for the well-being of all China people and pursues common prosperity for all. African countries should also prioritize the needs and interests of their people, and strive to improve their living standards and social welfare.Third, just like China modernization, African countries can also enhance their self-reliance and innovation and diversify their economies and markets while promoting green and sustainable development and balancing their economic growth and environmental protection.Finally, China modernization adheres to the vision of a global community of shared future and promotes open and inclusive cooperation with other countries, which is something African countries should pursue too.Global Times: The AU became a full member of the G20 in 2023. What role do you think the cooperation between China and the AU will play in global governance?Mwencha: The AU is a continental body that represents the interests and aspirations of the 55 African countries. The G20 membership gives the AU the same status as the EU Union and allows it to have a voice and influence on key global issues.China has a comprehensive strategic partnership with the AU and supports the AU's Agenda 2063, a strategic framework for the socio-economic transformation of the continent. China is also the largest trading partner, investor and infrastructure financier in Africa. The cooperation between China and the AU will play an important role in global governance, as both sides share common interests and visions for a more just and equitable international order.Globally, China and the AU can uphold the principles of multilateralism, and support the role of the UN and other international organizations. China and the AU can also advocate for the reform and improvement of the global governance system, and the representation and voice of developing countries.Global Times: Some West media and politicians have smeared China's investment in Africa as a ""debt trap"" and have even claimed that China has plundered Africa's natural resources. What do you think of these voices? What is the biggest difference between China's investment in Africa and the West's in Africa?Mwencha: I think these voices are not based on facts. They are based on biases and misunderstandings. China's investment in Africa is not a debt trap, nor a plunder of natural resources, but a win-win cooperation that benefits both sides. China's investment in Africa is not concentrated in natural resource-rich countries, but covers a wide range of sectors and regions. China's investment is not driven by a deliberate strategy to induce debt, but by market opportunities and mutual interests. China has provided debt relief and concessional loans to African countries and has supported their development resilience and green transition.The biggest difference between China's investment in Africa and the West's in Africa is that China respects the sovereignty and choice of African countries, and does not impose political or ideological conditions on its economic cooperation. China also follows the principle of equality, openness, inclusiveness and win-win cooperation, and seeks to build a global community of shared future with Africa. For all intents and purposes, the narrative that China is lending to Africa a ""debt trap"" is a diversionary tactic. If anything, most of the lending from West bilateral and multilateral creditors can hardly be accounted for.Global Times: How do you predict the prospects of cooperation between China and Africa in 2024? In what areas do you expect China and Africa to further deepen cooperation?Mwencha: I think the prospects of cooperation between China and Africa in 2024 are bright and promising. China and Africa have a long history of friendship and solidarity and have built an even stronger community of shared future in the new era. China and Africa have supported each other in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic, and now they are working together to promote the recovery and development of both sides.I expect China and Africa to further deepen their cooperation in many areas. In terms of economic and trade cooperation, China and Africa should continue to expand their trade and investment ties, and support the implementation of the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA). They should cooperate on new business forms such as digital economy, smart city, clean energy and 5G.They should also enhance their cooperation on the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, and support the development resilience and green transition of African countries. They should strengthen their cooperation on climate change, and support the implementation of the Paris Agreement and the Glasgow Pact.Peace and security are other areas in which China and Africa should step up cooperation. The two sides should reinforce their cooperation on peace and security, and China should continue to support the AU's efforts to prevent and resolve conflicts and promote peacekeeping and peacebuilding in Africa.",OPINION,VIEWPOINT,"A view of the African Union Headquarters in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia Photo: VCG",Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'China': ('LOC', 17), 'Africa': ('LOC', 2), 'Saudi Arabia': ('LOC', 1), 'Iran': ('LOC', 1), 'San Francisco': ('LOC', 1), 'South Africa': ('LOC', 3), 'Russia': ('LOC', 2), 'Ukraine': ('LOC', 2), 'Palestine': ('LOC', 1), 'Israel': ('LOC', 1), 'Erastus Mwencha': ('PER', 2), 'Xia Wenxin': ('PER', 1), 'Mwen': ('PER', 1), 'Xi Jinping': ('PER', 2), 'Joe Biden': ('PER', 1), 'African Union': ('ORG', 1), 'AU ) Commission': ('ORG', 2), 'Global Times': ('ORG', 4), 'Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation': ('ORG', 1), 'Security': ('ORG', 1), 'Li': ('ORG', 1), 'Third': ('MISC', 1), 'BRICS Summit': ('MISC', 1), 'Global Civilization Initiative': ('MISC', 3), 'Global Development Initiative': ('MISC', 2)}"
157,Global South countries strive to make 2024 the year of decolonization,S.L. Kanthan,2024-01-08,"There is a revolution brewing across the Global South. From Asia to Africa and Latin America, developing countries are creating a new geopolitical paradigm based on partnership, peace and progress. This movement away from the US-led world of disorder was ironically accelerated by the US' own aggression worldwide. The transformation toward a multipolar world, which made significant progress in 2023, will accelerate this year, making 2024 the year of decolonization.Looking at the big picture, the world has been dominated by EU empires to varying degrees for 400 years, and then by the US empire since WWII. After the fall of the USSR, US thought their unipolar hegemony would last forever. However, they did not appreciate the potential of Asia or the inexorable cycles of history. Filled with hubris, the US deindustrialized itself, outsourced key sectors of manufacturing, financialized its economy, printed trillions of dollars, and engaged in perpetual wars. The delusion ended during the 2008 financial crisis, which revealed the US economy to be a Ponzi scheme propped up by the exorbitant privilege of the US dollar. The Global South watched in dismay but could not do anything since there was no alternative to the US and its rigged system.However, nobody was ready for what happened next - the astonishing rise of China.In 2009, China became the world's largest exporter, and in 2010, it surpassed Japan to become the world's second-largest economy. In 2011, China surpassed the US in patents, and in 2012, its middle class became the largest in the world. In 2013, China ranked first in e-commerce sales, in 2014, second in the stock market, in 2015, second in R&D spending, and in 2016, it became the largest economy in the world by PPP GDP.However, given these achievements, the US began to exhibit anti-China hysteria and resorted to illegal and unethical tactics to contain China. These tactics include trade wars, tech wars and sanctions that violated WTO rules and the spirit of free trade. The US also supported a color revolution in Hong Kong and engaged in propaganda wars using Xinjiang separatists funded by the CIA. Additionally, the US media has coordinated a smear campaign against China's BRI.Furthermore, the US launched proxy wars in various parts of the world, with Syria and Ukraine being notable examples. The list of countries targeted for regime changes by the US in the last decade is long - Brazil, Bolivia, Venezuela, Thailand, Kazakhstan, Belarus and Pakistan, to name a few. Recently, the US has been bullying India as well, while claiming that its bilateral relationship with the country is the most consequential of this century.As US whistleblower Edward Snowden revealed, the US brazenly spies on the leaders of EU ""allies."" Consumed by a zero-sum attitude, US strategy for global primacy rests on disrupting EU's relations with Russia and China. The world has had enough. The last straw was when the US imposed shock-and-awe sanctions on Russia, expelled it from SWIFT, and confiscated $300 billion of Russia foreign exchange reserves. The Global South understood that the ""rules-based order"" had only one rule: America will do anything it takes to impose full-spectrum dominance over the world. Thus, in 2023, tectonic changes unraveled in geopolitics. The détente between Saudi Arabia and Iran - brokered by China - followed by their admission into BRICS, was a game changer. The era of divide-and-rule was over. Dozens of more countries are poised to join BRICS+. The vision for a multipolar world is clear: cooperation as sovereign partners, focus on infrastructure, economic development and mutually beneficial trade.The era of colonization is over. Global South countries are actively embracing dedollarization. ""Who decided dollar would be the trade currency?"" asked Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva. There is no need for African countries to use the US dollar while trading with one another, said Kenyan President William Samoei Ruto to a thunderous applause from the audience. Throughout history, the currency of the world's largest trading nation has enjoyed global status. Thus, the internationalization of the yuan should not surprise anyone. Already, about half of China's cross-border transactions are happening in yuan, which has also surpassed the Euro in global trade invoicing and the Japanese yen in SWIFT transactions. When OPEC countries start selling oil for yuan, it will mark the beginning of the end for the Petrodollar. In terms of military power projection, the US empire will be perceived as a ""paper tiger"" and ineffectual in 2024. In Ukraine, despite all the financial, military and propaganda support from US/EU/NATO, it's widely believed Russia has almost won the war. The victory will be confirmed in 2024.In the Middle East, the US faces a lose-lose situation. It can either start a disastrous regional war and bomb Gaza, Yemen, Lebanon, Syria and Iran all at once, or concede defeat. The rational choice of a two-state solution is still unthinkable in the echo chamber of Washington. The next decade will determine the great power game and the evolution of the 21st century, but 2024 will be a pivotal year.The author is a geopolitical analyst, columnist, blogger, podcaster, and writer based out of Bangalore, India.

158,Pentagon chief's unannounced hospitalization 'reflects chaotic management of the US government',Fan Anqi,2024-01-08,"Pentagon chief Lloyd Austin has received harsh criticism in recent days for leaving the US President Joe Biden, the White House, and even his Department of Defense (DOD) colleagues in the dark for days about his hospitalization, at a time when the US faces a slew of complications overseas, with the growing risk of conflict spillover in the Middle East and a prolonged battle in Ukraine. Austin's unannounced absence from office reflected the chaotic management of the US government, and has provided Republican with fresh ammunition to attack the Joe Biden administration before the upcoming presidential election, experts said.According to a CNN report citing sources familiar with the matter, the head of DOD was admitted to a hospital's intensive care unit on New Year's Day due to complications from an elective surgery, but Joe Biden was not informed about the matter until four days later on January 4, when national security adviser Jake Sullivan told him.It came as a shock to all White House staff as the Pentagon didn't make the information public until Friday evening, notifying Congress only 15 minutes before releasing a public statement.The news came as a surprise to even Pentagon staff. Deputy Secretary of Defense Kathleen Hicks, who was told to assume some of Austin's responsibilities on January 2 while still on vacation in Puerto Rico, did not know the true situation until January 4, officials revealed. As the highest-ranking leader in the DOD and the principal advisor to the US president, the secretary of defense plays a crucial role in both the administrative and operational command chains of the military. And due to the suddenness, fast pace, and high intensity of modern warfare, the efficiency of command and control directly affects the operation of war. Under these circumstances, Austin's multi-day absence was met with outrage in military and political circles, China analysts said.""This should not have happened this way,"" said one of US official. Others from the GOP called the event a ""shocking breakdown,"" pointing out that Austin's position requires the weightiest of decisions to be made in minutes, including ""the nuclear chain of command.""The event reflected a disorderly US government with both the DOD and the Joe Biden administration neglecting their duties, Li Haidong, a professor at the China Foreign Affairs University, told the Global Times on Monday. ""As the president, Joe Biden has proven to be inadequate in knowing even the whereabouts of his cabinet members,"" the expert said. The main reason for Austin's silence is likely to be personal, analysts said. For one thing, Austin has always impressed others as a relatively low-key figure who stresses privacy. Another reason may be that he wanted to avoid causing disruptions to the actions of the US military due to personal health issues, they noted. While Austin remains in hospital, the US government is drawing up a number of plans to respond to mounting concerns that the war in Gaza could expand into a wider, protracted regional conflict.Austin, who resumed his responsibilities as defense secretary Friday night, remained hospitalized Sunday, according to the Wall Street Journal.There has been no disclosure as to whether Austin lost consciousness before or after being admitted to the hospital, nor has it revealed to what extent his responsibilities were handled by his deputy.As the two most prominent candidates for the election - the incumbent and the former president Donald Trump - began their campaign rallies, the DOD chief's mishap dealt a heavy blow to Democrats, as it offered Republican new ammunition with which to attack Joe Biden and add fuel to the fire, by criticizing his incompetence not only in governing the country but also his own cabinet, Li said.",CHINA,SOCIETY,"US Secretary of Defence Lloyd Austin observes the national anthem during a ceremonial welcome at the Defence Ministry in Seoul on January 31, 2023.

159,Spillover effect of Gaza war heightens concerns; US 'hardly' plays a role of peacemaker,GT staff reporters,2024-01-07,"The aftermath of conflict in Gaza has seen its effects reverberate throughout the region as Hezbollah, the Lebanon military faction, launched 62 rockets at a significant Israel military base on Saturday, which was described as a preliminary response to the assassination of the deputy chief of Hamas. Some experts said on Sunday that this act heightened concerns about the intensifying discord between US-backed Israel and what the West media terms as the Axis of Resistance, an ""anti-Israel coalition"" informally led by Iran.In an effort to mitigate these rising tensions, high-ranking West officials, including US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and the EU's senior diplomat Josep Borrell, embarked on separate missions in the region. Their goal is to avert further escalations, not only in Lebanon but also along the critical Red Sea shipping lanes. However, some experts expressed skepticism about the effectiveness of these interventions as they argued that the inconsistent policies of the US undermine its ability to act as a peacemaker in easing the ongoing tensions. Hezbollah has claimed responsibility for firing 62 rockets at a crucial Israel military site, stating this action was an initial reaction to the recent killing of a Hamas leader in Beirut, Al Jazeera reported on Saturday. Israel has made clear it views as untenable the regular exchange of fire between its forces and Hezbollah along the border, and that it may soon launch a major military operation in Lebanon, the Washington Post reported on Sunday. The US media outlet also pointed out that US officials are concerned that Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu may see an expanded fight in Lebanon as key to his political survival amid domestic criticism of his government's failure to prevent the Hamas attack on October 7, 2023. ""The interests of the US and Israel in the Middle East have significantly diverged now,"" Sun Degang, director of the Center for Middle Eastern Studies at Fudan University, told the Global Times on Sunday.Israel aims to capitalize on its recent victories to address security concerns in the north and potentially extend its military achievements. In this context, the visit of Blinken to the region is an attempt to calm the situation and stabilize the region, as the US does not hope to see an escalation of the conflict as it has to deal with the presidential election this year and does not want the Middle East to consume too much of its energy when its major focus is still on strategic competition with major powers such as Russia and China, Sun said. Blinken is in Amman, Jordan, for meetings on local time Sunday as part of his visit to the region, The New York Times reported. He met his Turkey counterpart Hakan Fidan, as well as Turkey President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Saturday, with whom Blinken discussed the need to keep the Gaza conflict from spreading. He also met with Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis on the island of Crete.This is also Blinken's fourth visit in three months to the region and he will also visit Qatar, the United Saudi Arabia Emirates and Saudi Arabia on Sunday and Monday. Then he will visit Israel and the West Bank on Tuesday and Wednesday before wrapping up the trip in Egypt, the AP reported.""During Blinken's visit, particularly in engaging with Jordan and Qatar, there was a clear attempt at mediation, as Jordan is closely connected to the Palestine conflict, especially concerning refugee issues and aid,"" Liu Zhongmin, a professor at the Middle East Studies Institute of Shanghai International Studies University, told the Global Times on Sunday. With the West Bank being a point of spillover, where Israel has intensified its operations recently, Jordan's role becomes even more pivotal. Qatar, previously instrumental in temporary cease-fires and hostage exchanges, also plays a significant role, Liu said.These diplomatic gestures by the US aim to de-escalate the conflict. However, the US has consistently shown duplicity in its approach. For instance, in the Red Sea region, it has not sought de-escalation with the Houthi rebels but rather intensified attacks by forming a so-called escort alliance, the expert said. US military forces shot down a drone early Saturday over the Red Sea in international waters near several commercial vessels, the AFP reported, citing the Pentagon. And the incident came just days after a 12-nation group led by the US warned Houthi rebels in Yemen against continuing their attacks on Red Sea shipping.Attacking Houthi rebels is not a solution, as that lies in achieving a comprehensive cease-fire in the Gaza conflict, some experts said. ""While the US displayed diplomatic efforts on one hand, it has been increasing military actions in Yemen, Iraq, and Syria on the other, highlighting its duplicitous nature. Despite multiple visits by Blinken, these actions have not effectively served as 'firefighting' measures,"" Liu said.",CHINA,SOCIETY,"Smoke billows over the southern Gaza Strip during Israeli bombardment on December 17, 2023, amid continuing battles between Israel and Hamas.

161,Division and violence in US continue as the country enters 2024,Elias Cepeda,2024-01-06," America is divided. America is violent. America is headed into an election year between two candidates intimately familiar with one another. Each candidate tells their tens of millions of supporters that the other will destroy the nation. Their last contest for the US presidency produced an attempted self-coup. Joe Biden's reelection campaign has already said that President Joe Biden, in a speech on January 6, three years after the attacks on the US Capitol, will make the case that Donald Trump poses an existential threat to democracy.Among those who are affiliated with the perpetrators of the Capitol attack, from Donald Trump to his thousands of foot soldiers, political violence has only become more popular and viewed as necessary. A third of US Republican voters approve of domestic political violence now that they don't control the White House. With their team captain sitting in the Oval Office, only 13 percent of Democrats believe the same. US voters are split evenly, with almost half of voters affiliating with neither the Democratic nor Republican Party. Those who identify with different parties can't seem to agree on how to address many of our most pressing issues. For instance, more than 75 percent of Democrat voters believe that climate change is a serious threat to our country. Only 23 percent of Republican agree.  In our nation, founded on genocide and slavery, Democrats and Republican are at opposite poles on how much of a problem racial discrimination is. Wages are stagnant, prices of staples remain high and US homelessness is rampant. US are angry, and feel unheard and desperate. We own more firearms than any other nation, by a factor of more than two. Now, gun sales are moving at double the rate of two decades ago, with 60 million guns purchased anew between our last presidential election year in 2020 and 2022.  As hundreds of thousands of people take to the streets, our government officials are increasing surveillance. They are making it legal to assault and run protestors over, while prosecutors charge peaceful protestors with terrorism. We're faced with plenty to fear. Our claims to democracy were given too much credence. We grew to lag behind the rest of the developed world in areas like education and healthcare.  The divisions among us are clear and dangerous. Less celebrated, perhaps because they do not serve our ruling establishment, are the many ways in which US are united, even if we do not yet realize them. Yes, both parties enjoy an even 29 percent split of voters, but that means that the clear plurality of voters identifies with neither corporate party. Millions more citizens don't vote at all, but still take part in protests. US are discouraged and angry, but active. We are united by our low estimation of the status quo and ruling establishment. Given that most US face common stresses and crises, it is entirely possible that we begin to recognize our common ground. Hundreds of thousands of people are protesting the US' and Israel's actions against the Palestine people. Thousands of workers are unionizing and striking across every industry. The lie that our major parties are divided (when, in fact, they work together seamlessly to worsen climate crises, expand belligerent US imperialism, and advance corporate and financial institution interests) is exploited by politicians to fuel the most violent divisions between US civilians. This lie, and manufactured division, also allows deeper, more systemic domestic violence - that perpetrated by the US state against its people - to grow. US elites work hard to make the rest of us believe that we have different interests sufficient to hate one another. In many ways they appear to be succeeding heading into 2024, but we still have a chance to realize and act upon the fact that we have more in common with one another than we do with any of them. The author is a Chicago-based columnist covering US politics & culture.

164,China promotes peace while US embraces wars,Victor Gao,2024-01-05," Thailand and China will waive visa requirements for each other's citizens from March, Thai Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin announced on Tuesday. It will be a win-win situation for both the China people and the Thai people.China and Thailand are very friendly toward each other. In terms of culture and the way of doing business, China and Thailand have a lot in common. Against the backdrop, the visa-free policy will promote economic and trade engagement between China and Thailand in many ways.In December, China and Singapore announced a mutual 30-day visa-free policy. China and Malaysia also have similar mutual visa-free policy. Although the visa waiver schemes with Singapore and Malaysia are not permanent, I hope that Singapore, Malaysia, and other ASEAN countries can also follow Thailand's example. The better such a visa exemption arrangement will be, the better it will be for the recipient countries in terms of boosting their tourist industry.Traditionally, China has deep and friendly relations with most ASEAN members. Such exchanges of friendship and goodwill are based on hundreds, even thousands, of years. This kind of communication will continue in various forms. As of July 2023, the cumulative bilateral investment between China and ASEAN countries had exceeded $380 billion, with over 6,500 direct investment enterprises established in ASEAN. China has maintained its position as ASEAN's largest trading partner for 14 consecutive years, and the two sides have been each other's top trading partner for three consecutive years.Tourism could become a catalyst for China and ASEAN countries to expand cooperation and promote integration. Visa waiver programs will promote China and Southeast Asia to be better integrated. There is still a lot of potential for development between China and ASEAN, for example, in environmental cooperation and energy cooperation, and in particular, in cooperation in science and technology. China-ASEAN cooperation will set a good example for many other countries. We will also be in a better position to promote peace, stability and prosperity throughout the world.What happens between China and ASEAN serves as a stark contrast to the situation in EU and the Middle East. The Israel-Palestine conflict and the Russia-Ukraine conflict are still going on. It is truly a tragedy to see war rage in other parts of the world. However, in Asia, we have managed to do our best to promote peace and stability and avoid using war as an instrument to solve any bilateral disputes.The current momentum between China and ASEAN is something that the US will hardly learn. From the financial support given to Ukraine by the US as well as the US' stance in the Palestinian-Israeli Conflict conflict, all the decisions taken by the US are merely based on its own interests.Actually, most US are friendly, and they love peace rather than war. In that sense, I do think people from China, the US, and many other countries in the world can jointly make an effort to make sure that war is not being embraced by any country. This task is very challenging. A slight carelessness could rock the boat and divert our attention from peaceful engagement and cooperation with each other to confrontation, rivalry, or another version of the Cold War.China will continue to play a very important role in the peacekeeping operations of the UN. That means China will have a lot of things to do to promote peace and stability. And this visa-free policy between China and Thailand starting in March this year will be a good start for 2024.The author is a chair professor at Soochow University and Vice President of the Center for China and Globalization. opinion@globaltimes.com.cn",OPINION,VIEWPOINT,Illustration: Chen Xia/GT,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'Thailand': ('LOC', 5), 'China': ('LOC', 16), 'Singapore': ('LOC', 3), 'Malaysia': ('LOC', 3), 'Southeast Asia': ('LOC', 2), 'Middle East': ('LOC', 1), 'Israel': ('LOC', 1), 'Palestine': ('LOC', 1), 'Russia': ('LOC', 1), 'Ukraine': ('LOC', 1), 'ASEA': ('LOC', 1), 'Thai': ('MISC', 2), 'ASEAN': ('MISC', 9), 'Srettha Thavisin': ('PER', 1), 'EU': ('ORG', 1)}"
165,"Certain countries spread ‘genocide’ rumors on Xinjiang, while turning blind eye to humanitarian tragedy in Gaza: Chinese FM",Global Times,2024-01-05," Certain countries are obsessed with spreading rumors of the so-called ethnic genocide and forced labor in Northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, while turning a blind eye to the current humanitarian tragedy in Gaza, which fully exposes their hypocritical double standards, said China Foreign Ministry spokesperson on a Friday press conference.More and more foreign friends have visited Xinjiang, sharing their authentic experiences, said China Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin when asked to comment on the remarks of Moiz Farooq, an executive editor of Daily Ittehad Media Group, who visited the Xinjiang region as a member of the Pakistani media think tank delegation in December 2023.Farooq said in an interview that he saw the happy and fulfilling lives of the Muslim population in the Xinjiang region. ""I saw Muslims there who were free to enjoy and practice their religion,"" said Farooq as quoted by Al Jazeera. ""It is the agenda of the West to show the worst of Xinjiang and I now know that the stories are not true because I have seen how happily they are living."" According to Wang, there have been over 4,300 foreign guests from countries and international organizations, including Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, Pakistan, Indonesia, Malaysia, Japan, Egypt, France, Germany, Switzerland, Canada, the Saudi Arabia League, and the Organization of Islamic Cooperation who visited the Xinjiang region in 2023.The foreign guests included government officials, religious figures, experts and scholars, media reporters, and ordinary people, Wang said. They listened to religious personnel preaching in mosques and Islamic seminaries, saw the protection and inheritance of the Xinjiang region's culture in the streets and alleys, learned about the region's production and development in factories and fields, and witnessed the happy lives of people of all ethnic groups in ordinary households.Not just Farooq, Wang said other delegates such as guests from Japan and France also expressed their witness of peaceful and harmonious life of the local people, pointing out the claim of the so-called genocide of religion, language and culture, as well as forced labor were nonsense.Wang emphasized that seeing is believing and the door of the Xinjiang region is always open. ""China sincerely welcomes more friends from all countries to visit the Xinjiang region in person, to personally experience the beauty, harmony, prosperity, and stability of the region,"" Wang said.In late December, Global Times reporters paid a visit to the Xinjiang region together with 15 representatives from Pakistani media and think tanks. The journalists and scholars told the Global Times that one of the most impressive aspects for them during a five-day on-site visit was the development of Muslims in the Xinjiang region and the religious freedom they enjoy.

166,Blinken heads to Middle East again as interlinked tensions near boiling point,Fan Anqi,2024-01-05,"US Secretary of State Antony Blinken is heading to the Middle East again late Thursday on his fourth trip to the region since the latest escalation in the Palestinian-Israeli Conflict conflict, as interlinked tensions reach boiling point and push the region to the brink of an inferno. Experts said the tension has highlighted the dilemma the US has put itself in, between continuing support for Israel and the urgent need to rope in other Saudi Arabia countries to prevent further escalation. They urged the US to take concrete and responsible measures to prevent the situation from plummeting further. On his first overseas trip of 2024, Blinken will visit Israel, the West Bank, Turkey, Greece, Jordan, Qatar, the United Saudi Arabia Emirates, Saudi Arabia and Egypt, US State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller told media.His visit comes as fears mount that the Palestinian-Israeli Conflict conflict will spiral into a regional war, with the assassination in Lebanon of a top Hamas leader on Tuesday, the deadly terrorist attack in Iran on Wednesday, and multiple attacks on shipping vessels in the Red Sea. According to Miller, Blinken will reiterate his appeal to facilitate the delivery of humanitarian aid into Gaza, while also discussing the contentious issue of post-war management of the Gaza, which experts said is one of the major divergences the US and Israel currently face. The pair has seen growing disagreements over their strategic and tactical approaches in the war, which is another reason for Blinken's trip, as the US tries to reconcile recent rifts with Israel, Zhu Yongbiao, executive director of the Research Center for the Belt and Road at Lanzhou University, told the Global Times on Friday.This disagreement is something the US did not wish to see, but due to Israel's excessive actions and statements, which have sparked fury in the international community, the US has had to keep some distance in order to protect its own image, Zhu noted. Blinken is expected to renew his efforts to urge Israel to minimize the impact of its military operation in Gaza on civilians, which has resulted in a humanitarian crisis, according to relief agencies. Expecting the trip to be bumpy and delicate, Miller acknowledged the challenges facing Blinken. ""We don't expect every conversation on this trip to be easy,"" he said, reported Reuters. Washington is now caught in a dilemma, Zhu said, as on the one hand it finds it more difficult to coordinate with Saudi Arabia countries in order to garner support on the Red Sea issue, while on the other hand facing increasing dissatisfaction from Israel, which thinks Washington's actions have not been tough enough.It will not be easy for Washington to push for more humanitarian aid either. The US' biased position means that it cannot provide a solution that satisfies both the Muslim world and Israel, while also meeting the expectations of the international community and serving its own interests.Nevertheless, the US still has leverage to exert control over Israel, but the key is whether it's willing to do so, experts said, urging Washington to stop fanning the flames and take responsible actions.Ahead of Blinken's scheduled trip, Israel Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said that neither Israel nor Hamas will rule the Palestine territory, but only Palestine, appearing to take a softer tone from previous remarks by Israel officials calling for Palestine to ""emigrate"" from Gaza and for Israel settlers to return.Also on Friday, the Israel military announced that it will temporarily suspend military operations in the heavily bombarded Rafah area ""for humanitarian reasons,"" China Central Television reported.",CHINA,DIPLOMACY,"A group of pro-Palestine activists stage a protest in front of US Secretary of State Antony Blinken's house in McLean, Virginia, spilling fake blood on the streets and over his car as he leaves for work on January 4, 2024.

169,"Regional tension 'to intensify' while Iran vows revenge
 after terror attack",Yang Sheng,2024-01-04,"China expressed condolences to Iran on Thursday over the terrorist attack that killed more than 100 in Kerman, a southeastern city in the country, strongly condemning the attack while voicing support for Iran's efforts in safeguarding its national security and stability.China analysts said that the forces behind this attack remain unclear at the moment, but considering the intention and capability, as well as its form, the attack could have been conducted by forces with an anti-government stance within Iran and those with extreme hostility against the country in the region that have a mature capability and technical conditions to launch twin bomb attacks.  According to Iran official media on Wednesday, two explosions near the burial site of Iran's slain general Qassem Soleimani killed at least 103 people and wounded 141 others. The blasts occurred as many people gathered at the cemetery in Kerman to mark the fourth anniversary of Soleimani's death in a US drone strike. China President Xi Jinping on Thursday sent a message of condolences to Iran President Ebrahim Raisi over the serious terror attacks in the country, the Xinhua reported. China Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said at a routine press conference on Thursday that China is deeply shocked by the serious terrorist attack and heavy casualties in Iran. ""We express deep condolences to the victims and sincere sympathy to the injured and the bereaved families. China opposes all forms of terrorism, strongly condemns terrorist attacks and firmly supports Iran's efforts to safeguard national security and stability,"" Wang noted.Condemnations from around the world Supreme Leader of Iran's Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Seyyed Ali Khamenei issued a message on the martyrdom of dozens of people in the terrorist attack, warning the ""criminals"" of punishment and a hard response over the tragedy they caused, the IRNA reported.Iran President Ebrahim Raisi said the enemies may believe they can achieve their illegitimate goals through terrorism, but the Iran nation has proven that such crimes will not disrupt their ""unity, security, and strategy."" Raisi made the remarks on Wednesday night as he received a phone call from his Turkey counterpart Recep Tayyip Erdogan.After the blasts, in addition to China, many countries around the world, including Russia, Turkey, Saudi Arabia and many Islamic countries, as well as UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres expressed their condemnation of the attack.  Russia President Vladimir Putin has condemned terrorism in all its forms and offered his condolences to the Iran leadership over the terrorist attack in Kerman, TASS reported on Wednesday. Guterres on Wednesday strongly condemned the attack, a UN spokeswoman said on Wednesday. ""The Secretary-General expresses his deep condolences to the bereaved families and the people and the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran. He wishes the injured a speedy recovery,"" said Florencia Soto Niño, UN Associate Spokesperson, speaking to journalists at the regular noon briefing in New York.The EU and France also condemned the bombings. EU's foreign policy chief Josep Borrell wrote on X that he had a telephone conversation with Iran Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian, during which he expressed condolences to Abdollahian for the bomb attack in Kerman.As of press time, no one has claimed responsibility for the bombings. China analysts said that the attacks came after a series of incidents, including a Houthi attack against Israel-linked ships in the Red Sea, and the airstrike against Hamas senior officials in Beirut. They said that no matter who is behind this bombing, the regional tension with the ongoing Gaza conflict at its core will worsen, as more major powers will be forced to become involved.Wang Jin, a professor and Middle East studies expert at Lanzhou University, told the Global Times on Thursday that ""the Palestine-Israel conflict is showing a trend of escalation, and more and more forces have become involved, and the attack in Iran will make relations between different major powers in the region increasingly sensitive and fragile.""Who did it?US State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller told a regular news briefing on Wednesday that the US was not involved in any way in the explosions and has no reason to believe Israel was.""Washington says USA and Israel had no role in the terrorist attack in Kerman, Iran. Really? A fox smells its own lair first.  Make no mistake. The responsibility for this crime lies with the US and Zionist regimes and terrorism is just a tool,"" Mohammad Jamshidi, deputy chief of Staff for Political Affairs to Iran President, said on his X account.In a statement on Wednesday night, Hamas said that any terrorist act targeting civilians and seeking to disrupt the security and stability of the Islamic Republic of Iran ""serves the sinister plans of the Zionist enemy,"" the IRNA reported.""It's not a secret that Israel and the US have always targeted Iran scientists and senior officials and military commanders and have conducted many attacks within Iran and other places in the Middle East, so it's possible that Israel is connected with the bombings as it needs to retaliate against Iran over issues like the Houthi attacks against its ships in the Red Sea,"" Ma Xiaolin, dean of the Institute for Studies on the Mediterranean Rim at Zhejiang International Studies University, told the Global Times on Thursday.However, Israel normally targets high-value figures related to Iran's nuclear facilities, and the US normally targets the senior leaders of Iran's military force, and the attack against civilians will bring no benefits but only risks and a negative impact on Israel and the US, Wang said, adding that the bombing is unlikely to have been conducted by the Netanyahu administration and Washington.The attack serves the goal of forcing Iran to get involved in the current conflict and to keep the US involved in the ongoing crisis in the region, so it's possible that the bombing was conducted by anti-government forces within Iran cooperating with anti-Iran forces outside the country connected with Israel's intelligence agency Mossad, said a Shanghai-based expert on international security who asked for anonymity. ""Some of these forces don't want to see the US walk away from the mess, so they want to push Iran to get involved more directly, so that they might have the chance to hype up the conflict between Iran and the US, or to use the US' strength to weaken Iran. This scenario serves their interests,"" he noted. Wen Shaobiao, an expert from the Shanghai International Studies University, told the Global Times on Thursday that ""after the attack, Iran might mobilize its proxies and allies in the region, such as Hezbollah, Houthis and other armed groups in Iraq to attack Israel, while the US military base in Syria will also be targeted, and the Red Sea crisis might be further intensified.""",CHINA,DIPLOMACY,"Lebanese civil defense members spray water on the street by the building that was hit by an Israeli strike targeting Hamas deputy leader Saleh al-Aruri in the southern suburb of Beirut on January 3, 2024.

170,US ‘low-cost’ warning to Houthi militia has little impact on settling Red Sea crisis,GT staff reporters,2024-01-04,"The ""low-cost warning"" issued by the US-led coalition to Yemen's Houthi rebels may not have a significant impact on easing tensions on the Red Sea waters, and the coalition's persistent use of military tactics could exacerbate the situation, analysts warned, calling for international efforts to achieve a political resolution to both the Red Sea crisis and a cease-fire in Gaza and to avoid further spillover of the conflicts in the Middle East. On Wednesday, a group of countries led by the US, including Australia, Canada, Germany and Japan, warned Yemen's Houthi rebels of ""consequences"" unless they immediately halt sea attacks that are increasingly disrupting global commerce. The Joe Biden administration described the joint statement as a final warning as he weighs possible military strikes against the Houthis if attacks persist, according to media reports. In response to why China has not jointly condemned the Houthi militia, China Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said at a routine press conference on Thursday that China has always supported safeguarding the security of international waterways and rejected assaulting civilian ships.The Red Sea is an important international transportation route for goods and energy. Ensuring the security and stability of the region serves the common interests of the international community. All parties should play a constructive role in safeguarding the security of the Red Sea transportation route, said Wang.On Wednesday, the Houthi group in Yemen launched missiles targeting a cargo ship in the Red Sea. The group's military spokesperson Yahya Sarea said that the operation came after the ship's crew refused to respond to calls from the group, including fiery warning messages.Given the US' current strategy in the Middle East and the spillover effect of the Palestinian-Israeli Conflict, the US may intensify its operations targeting ships of the Houthi rebels in the Red Sea waters, Liu Zhongmin, a professor at the Middle East Studies Institute of Shanghai International Studies University, told the Global Times. The expert noted that the likelihood of the US extinguishing the Houthi rebels in Yemen is low due to the complex political situation in the country and the regional diplomatic dynamics.The Houthi militia's recent attacks on Israel ships in the Red Sea were aimed at showing support for Palestine and asserting their presence in the region while seeking political transformation. Additionally, a US attack on the Houthi militia in Yemen would disrupt negotiations among the group, the Yemeni government, and Saudi Arabia, which would not align with US interests in the region, said Liu. The ""final warning"" is the latest attempt by the US to deter the Houthi group, considering the US' limited resources in terms of fleets and soldiers for large-scale military operations in the region. The US also faces challenges in effectively attacking the decentralized militia group, which is hidden within Yemen's complex landscape, Ding Long, a professor with the Middle East Studies Institute of Shanghai International Studies University, told the Global Times.Ding also noted that the US is believed to have no intention of escalating the Palestinian-Israeli Conflict, and with the upcoming election, the Joe Biden administration is aiming to avoid engaging in a new war. However, the crisis in the Red Sea may persist as the US-led escort alliance has not only failed to resolve the issue but instead heightened the risk of a larger conflict with the Houthi militia. The root cause of the Red Sea crisis lies in the Palestinian-Israeli Conflict, and resolving the crisis relies on a cease-fire in Gaza, said Ding. However, the US deliberately avoids discussion of the connection between the Red Sea crisis and the Palestinian-Israeli Conflict, attempting to portray them as isolated events and only emphasizing the illegality and harm caused by the Houthi armed group. On Wednesday, the UN held its first open meeting on the continuing attacks by Houthi rebels in the Red Sea, during which Geng Shuang, China's deputy permanent representative to the UN, said that the current tensions in the Red Sea are one of the manifestations of the spillover effects of the conflict in Gaza. ""We call on the relevant party to cease assaulting civilian ships and respect and protect the freedom of navigation of all countries in the Red Sea. We believe that all parties, especially major countries with influence, need to play a constructive and responsible role in keeping the shipping lanes safe in the Red Sea,"" said Geng. Ding noted that the escalating Red Sea crisis is evolving into a global security challenge that requires a collective response from the international community. The US and West countries, in particular, should avoid exacerbating the situation and refrain from using military means to solve the Red Sea crisis and the Yemen issue. Strengthening international coordination and seeking a political solution should be the international consensus for resolving the Red Sea crisis, said Ding.",WORLD,MID-EAST,"An Israeli Navy missile boat is seen in the area of the Red Sea on Nov. 1, 2023.

172,China practises wise foreign policy in managing relations,Global Times,2024-01-03,"Editor's Note:In 2023, the world continued to witness significant changes and turbulence. As we have entered into 2024, we conducted in-depth interviews with leading strategists from various countries and regions to gather their perspectives on the prominent global issues of 2023 and China's role in addressing them as well as their expectations for China in 2024.Danilo Türk, former president of Slovenia and President of World Leadership Alliance-Club de MadridThe year of 2023 was very active for China. It started with a paper stating its position on the political settlement of the Ukraine crisis in February, which was a very good and valuable document. We have to understand that in the West, this paper was criticized for not being sufficiently specific, but there is something that the critics didn't understand. That was not meant to be a peace plan, but a conceptual framework within which a proper peace plan can be developed gradually.And then China [this year] was active on the Middle East issue. For example, it helped to bring together an important movement in March between Iran and Saudi Arabia. In June, while receiving the visiting Palestine president, China President Xi Jinping reemphasized the principle of the two-state solution, something that people didn't really notice at the time, but something that has subsequently become quite central. Now, when one talks about Gaza, one has to know that the political solution is the only solution that is necessary. Everything else is just temporary. The solution would require a full state of sovereignty for Palestine as well as full membership in the UN (UN). In the meantime, we have seen that during China's presidency in November, the UN first enabled the adoption of a resolution on Gaza. It was not a very strong resolution, but still, it was the first step.So, if we look at the year 2023, we can see that China was not only very active, but also very successful. Many things are not yet final, but in diplomacy, you don't come to the finality with haste. Being persistent is key, and I believe that the avenues that China opened are healthy and will lead to success.Chas Freeman, former senior US diplomat In San Francisco in November, China President Xi Jinping noted that ""for China and the US, turning their back on each other is not an option, it is unrealistic for one side to remodel the other."" He also stressed that ""the hope of the China-US relationship lies in the people, the vitality comes from exchanges at subnational levels.""I thought Xi Jinping's statements and performance in San Francisco were exemplary. That is good diplomacy. I think there's a long tradition in China of seeking common ground while reserving differences, and this is a sound approach to managing difficult relations. I think he's absolutely correct that the basic support for the relationship is people-to-people relations. I think he was successful in reassuring many US who are favorable to China in the business community. China also values their friendship and wishes to continue to cooperate with them. I think he also wanted to reassure China domestic private sector that he could manage the relationship with the US, and I think he succeeded in that. As for the Middle East, where China does not have the burden of history that the US does, I think we should be working together to solve these two wars and to end them. China has been very careful to avoid becoming entangled in the quarrels of countries in the Middle East. I think that's been a wise policy. We should be looking to China for help. John Menadue, former Secretary of the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet under Gough Whitlam and Malcolm FraserI think China has done a very good performance. The progress of the BRI, the expansion of BRICS, and the role of China in bridging the relationship between Saudi Arabia and Iran have all been very substantial achievements.The credit goes to China. Its diplomatic clout has been improved, while America continues to make awful mistakes. The US is clearly losing influence in the Global South. China is taking a great interest and is assisting the Global South. The Global South is watching what America has done in Ukraine and now in Gaza. During the COVID-19 period, the West, and particularly the US, turned its back on the Global South, even when it had a surplus of vaccines. It didn't supply or give any assistance to the poor countries in the Global South.There are the historical reasons why US leadership, even its moral leadership, has been declining dramatically in the last few years. China has clearly stepped up in the areas that I mentioned. China should be quite pleased with the progress it has been making. But obviously there are major concerns about what's happening in the South China Sea, continuing provocations over Taiwan question. There's a lot of diplomacy still required from China.  Koh King Kee, president of Center for New Inclusive Asia, a non-government Malaysian think tankThe Third Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation held in Beijing on October 17 and 18, 2023, commemorating the 10th anniversary of BRI is without question the most important diplomatic event of the year for China. Over the last decade, the BRI has evolved from a connectivity project, based on the concept and spirit of the ancient Silk Road, into an inclusive global cooperation partnership led and driven by China, but shared and owned by all partner countries. The BRI has become a platform through which China shares its technology, development experience, contributing to the realization of the UN Sustainable Development Goals. It is a concrete manifestation of China's peaceful rise. China's successful mediation of the Saudi Arabia-Iran detente in March 2023 is another notable diplomatic achievement that tacitly reflects China's growing influence on the global stage. This diplomatic feat, which surprised the West, will foster the collective rise of the Muslim world and potentially change the global power dynamics in the post-Ukraine war era. Peace is the foundation of humanity's persistent pursuit of development. There can be no sustainable development without peace and no peace without sustainable development. China believes that security is the most important global public good, and development is the shared responsibility of all countries.China advocates coexistence, exchange and mutual learning among different civilizations, as no civilization is more superior than any other. All countries should uphold common values of peace, development, equity, justice, democracy and freedom.The global challenges we face today impose an urgent need for a new paradigm of global governance beyond just optimizing the self-interests of nation-states. China's three global initiatives are its answers to the world that is now at the crossroads of history.",OPINION,VIEWPOINT,A view of Beijing Photo: VCG,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'China': ('LOC', 10), 'Slovenia': ('LOC', 1), 'Ukraine': ('LOC', 1), 'West': ('LOC', 1), 'Middle East': ('LOC', 1), 'Iran': ('LOC', 1), 'Saudi Arabia': ('LOC', 1), 'Palestine': ('LOC', 2), 'Gaza': ('LOC', 2), 'US': ('LOC', 2), 'Danilo Türk': ('PER', 1), 'Xi Jinping': ('PER', 1), 'Cha': ('PER', 1), 'San Francisco': ('PER', 1), 'Xi Jin': ('PER', 1), 'He': ('PER', 1), 'World Leadership Alliance': ('ORG', 1), 'Club de Madrid': ('ORG', 1), 'UN': ('ORG', 3)}"
173,"Senior Hamas leader’s killing risks escalating conflict, spillover",Yang Sheng,2024-01-03,"The conflict between Israel and Palestine armed group Hamas has affected more regions apart from the Gaza and the Red Sea, as the latest airstrike launched by the Israel military on Beirut, capital of Lebanon, killed a senior leader of Hamas, leading to more people expressing concerns about the escalation of the conflict.China analysts said on Wednesday the attack shows that Israel does not care about breaching the borders of other sovereign countries to launch air strikes, and it does not want to negotiate with Hamas for a cease-fire at all. It has also ignored concerns from the US about conflict escalation in the direction of Lebanon.Israel is looking for a way out of the current conflict but eliminating Hamas in Gaza is extremely difficult, so to eliminate senior Hamas leaders responsible for the October 7 attack could be a feasible plan. Therefore, in the next step, the military operation in Gaza might reduce and attacks that aim to kill Hamas leaders in other countries would increase, said experts.Conflict escalationSaleh al-Arouri, the second-in-command of Hamas's political office, was killed in Dahieh, a densely populated stronghold of Hezbollah, the Lebanon militant and political group. A spokesperson for Hezbollah told The Washington Post that the attack involved a drone armed with three rockets, and pinned the blame on Israel.Hamas announced a freeze on cease-fire negotiations with Israel after Arouri was killed on Tuesday evening, a Palestine source told the Xinhua.""We have informed the brothers in Qatar and Egypt of the freezing of negotiations,"" the source said on condition of anonymity. Qatar and Egypt have been mediating a cease-fire between Israel and Hamas.The source also said that Hamas, at war with Israel, rejected any talks about reaching a cease-fire in the Gaza amid escalated Israel aggression and ""assassination schemes"" against Palestine leaders.Lebanon caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati issued a statement late Tuesday condemning the attack, calling it a ""new Israel crime,"" the Turkey Anadolu Agency reported.Lebanon intends to file an urgent complaint with the UN against Israel in light of the attack, the Prime Minister's Office said in a statement. Lebanon has previously lodged several complaints against Israel at the UN, including cases related to targeting journalists in southern Lebanon and the occupying border towns.The incident once again proves that Israel and Hamas show no intention, and have no condition, to end their conflict, and even more unfortunately, the US is playing a role in the tolerance for the killings in Gaza, experts said.Wang Jin, an associate professor at the Institute of Middle Eastern Studies at Northwest University in Xi Jinping'an, told the Global Times on Wednesday that ""many senior leaders of Hamas are not based in Gaza, but in other countries like Lebanon, Turkey, Jordan, Syria and Qatar. After the attack in Beirut, more similar operations might occur in the region.""Some observers said the US will receive more pressure in the aftermath of the Beirut attack from Saudi Arabia countries, because the more Washington tolerates Israel continuing its war and uses the US' veto power to stop UN cease-fire resolutions, the more Saudi Arabia countries will come under the risk of Israel attacks or assassinations.Trita Parsi, co-founder and executive vice president of the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft, posted on his X account that the attack in Beirut ""shows once more that as time has passed and Joe Biden has refused to push for a cease-fire, we are getting closer and closer to a full war in the region."" Complex situationThe Wall Street Journal on December 23, 2023, reported that US President Joe Biden had urged Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to halt a preemptive strike against Hezbollah forces in Lebanon days after October 7, warning that such an attack could spark a wider regional war.The Joe Biden administration does not want to see a regional escalation as it will receive extra pressure and will risk losing control of the Middle East affairs, but it does not mean that Israel would listen. The latest airstrike in Beirut that brought anger from Lebanon proves that Israel just takes action while ignoring concerns from the US, analysts said. ""The attack in Beirut will add more turbulence to the region, but it doesn't necessarily mean Israel is ready to escalate the conflict to Lebanon, and other countries in the region have neither the intention nor condition to get involved in the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas,"" Ma Xiaolin, dean of the Institute for Studies on the Mediterranean Rim at Zhejiang International Studies University, told the Global Times on Wednesday.For Hamas, in the short term, it might lose its military strength to some extent, but it will maintain its existence in the region as a resistance group with political influence among the public. It is also extremely difficult for Israel to eliminate Hamas in the region, Ma noted. ""A possible and feasible way for Israel to end this conflict is to eliminate a group of senior leaders of Hamas inside and outside Gaza who were related to the October 7 attack, then it would be able to declare 'victory' to its people and end this brutal and costly war,"" said Wang of Northwest University.The death toll from Israel's war on Gaza now stands at 22,313 Palestine, the Health Ministry in Gaza says. At least 57,296 Palestine have been wounded, Al Jazeera reported on Wednesday. Thousands more are trapped under the rubble of their homes and are presumed dead.",WORLD,MID-EAST,"Lebanese civil defense members spray water on the street by the building that was hit by an Israeli strike targeting Hamas deputy leader Saleh al-Aruri in the southern suburb of Beirut on January 3, 2024.

175,China remains on the side of ‘certainty’ in 2024: Global Times editorial,Global Times,2024-01-02,"On New Year's Day 2024, the presidents of China and the US exchanged congratulatory messages to mark the 45th anniversary of diplomatic ties between the two countries. The day before, the leaders of China and Russia also exchanged messages of New Year greetings. These two sets of relationships between major powers, which have an impact on the international landscape, started off 2024 in a friendly and goodwill manner. It is the common wish of many people that the peaceful atmosphere of the holiday can last longer and spread wider in 2024, and it should also be a common goal pursued by all countries in their diplomacy.After years of continuous global turbulence, the desire for stability and security in people's hearts around the world has become even stronger. It has been noticed that in the New Year messages of leaders of major countries, two keywords ""storm"" and ""unity"" are commonly mentioned, indicating that countries around the world are generally aware that unity, rather than division, is the key to overcoming risks and uncertainties. True global unity, if it is not to be reduced to mere slogans, requires an effective platform for equal consultation and dialogue among countries, as well as public goods that help countries work together to address crises. In this regard, major powers, in particular, should set an example and demonstrate their ability to take action.Many institutions and think tanks have made predictions about what the world will be like in 2024. Factors such as the US presidential election, the Israel-Palestine conflict, the Russia-Ukraine conflict, and AI are generally classified as uncertainties. However, China's stability and development are placed in the category of certainties. China's diplomacy with China characteristics revolves around the theme of peace and development. How it engages and contributes in 2024 will play a crucial role in shaping the global landscape. It is not an exaggeration to say that China diplomacy has become one of the main sources of ""stability"" and ""security"" in the world.This year's US presidential election is seen as a major uncertainty or source of tension by many countries, including Japan. How well the US can control itself will be a big question mark for the world in 2024, and it is also a prerequisite for managing the US-China relationship. As proven by facts, as long as China and the US can get along well according to the three principles of mutual respect, peaceful coexistence, and win-win cooperation proposed by the China side, the world situation can stabilize to a large extent, and the factors of instability will be greatly reduced. For the world, the extent to which the US can control itself also means the level of risks and challenges. It requires the international community to make preparations to hedge against it.Of course, the US and the West is only a small part of the world in terms of population and area. The countries in the ""Global South"" have been very active in 2023, demonstrating stronger strategic autonomy as well as the willingness and ability to strengthen unity and coordination. The greater role and influence the ""Global South"" plays in global governance, the more the strategic monopoly of the US and the West can be diluted and constrained. As a member of the ""Global South,"" China will make more efforts this year to unite the ""Global South"" and achieve common development. Additionally, China will enable more developing countries to conveniently share its development opportunities.In 2024, China and the world will achieve deeper integration and mutual achievements. China's higher level of opening-up to the outside world will provide development opportunities for more countries, companies, and individuals. China's economy will continue to contribute to the recovery and development of the world economy. China's diplomacy will continue to adhere to principles, take a clear stance and stand firm on major issues concerning the future and development of humanity and the world. China will continue to advocate for fair and orderly world multipolarization and inclusive economic globalization, contributing China wisdom and strength to the peace and development of the world.As President Xi Jinping said, along the way, we are bound to encounter headwinds. When global challenges increase and intensify, all of humanity is in the same boat, facing the storms together. As the world changes, China is willing to actively contribute to peaceful development and win-win cooperation. It will also lead more countries and regions to promote overall stability in the world. China people's full historical confidence in the global situation will inspire more confidence worldwide for the year 2024. This power, gathered from the hearts of people, will truly drive the direction of human development and progress. Despite dramatic changes in the world, justice will always prevail. The more challenges we face, the more imperative it is for us to break waves and forge ahead.",OPINION,EDITORIAL,Striving for a prosperous 2024.

A vendor sells bread at an old market in Cairo, Egypt, Dec. 31, 2023. (Photo: Xinhua)Egypt's economic difficulties and the ongoing conflict in the nearby Gaza are the concerns of Egyptians as they make wishes for the New Year.""I hope it will be a year of maintaining security and stability in Egypt and settling the Palestine issue so that peace prevails in the region,"" said Zahran Ahmed, an Arabic teacher at a school in Cairo.""As for rising prices, I hope the government will strictly supervise the market and the prices set by merchants to combat commodity monopoly,"" he said.Egypt's economic challenges include a shortage of hard currency, growing external debt, and high inflation, which have affected the living standards of over 100 million citizens in the most populous Saudi Arabia country.While Egyptians have been struggling under skyrocketing inflation throughout 2023, the ongoing Israel deadly siege and bombardment in Gaza, which have killed nearly 22,000 Palestine and injured around 56,500 others since Oct. 7, added further pain to many Egyptians.""We cannot forget our people in Gaza who have been suffering an Israel aggression for about three months now. I hope the war stops very soon to relieve the people in Gaza,"" said Abdullah Al-Nozahy, a manager at a medical center.He also wished that Egypt would promote local products, reduce the trade deficit to face the shortage of the U.S. dollar, and curb inflation.In a crowded neighborhood in Giza province, vendors set up stands and carts on several main streets and marketplaces. They displayed a variety of festive New Year items, such as colorful party hats, balloons, funny face masks, trumpets, and more.One of the vendors was Ibrahim Tamer, 31, a man with three children, who said that he wished prices would ""cool down a bit"" in the new year.""We are really pressured by high prices, but we're still hopeful,"" the vendor said, noting that his sales on the New Year's Eve are less than previous ones.At a nearby local coffee shop, retired carpenter Salah Fadel, 82, said that he wished for the well-being of his children and grandchildren and for peace to replace conflicts in the region and the entire world.Seeking to ease anxieties ahead of the New Year, Egypt Prime Minister Madbouly unveiled on Saturday a plan to stabilize prices of everyday staples like sugar, pasta, and cheese, placing them under government supervision and labeling them ""strategic"" commodities.The Egypt pound has lost more than half of its value since March 2022. Many people in Egypt are concerned about another round of local currency devaluation in 2024, as an expected monetary measure by the government to contain inflation.""Until the economy improves, I believe we just have to adapt to austerity, buy only basic needs and give up unnecessary purchases,"" Zainab Mohamed, a housewife, recommended.

177,3 Hezbollah fighters killed in Lebanon-Israel border confrontations,Xinhua,2024-01-02,"Three Hezbollah fighters were killed on Monday in confrontations with Israel forces on the border area in southern Lebanon, Lebanon military sources said.The sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that the casualties resulted from Israel firing eight air-to-surface missiles in the southeastern village of Kafr Kila.In addition, the Israel army launched air strikes and heavy artillery targeting several villages and towns in southern Lebanon, destroying eight houses, and damaging dozens of others, the sources noted.Meanwhile, Hezbollah said its fighters attacked an Israel site in Hadab Al-Bustan, a gathering of soldiers in the Ya'ara Barracks, the al-Motella settlement, and the Hanita site, leading to some casualties.The Lebanon-Israel border witnessed increased tension since Oct. 8 after the Lebanon armed group Hezbollah fired dozens of rockets toward Israel in support of the Hamas attacks on Israel the previous day, prompting Israel to respond by firing heavy artillery toward southeastern Lebanon.The confrontations between Hezbollah and Israel killed 191 on the Lebanon side, including 136 Hezbollah members, a member of the civil defense, a Lebanon army soldier, one member of the Amal Movement and one from the Syria Socialist Nationalist Party, 16 members of Hamas and Islamic Jihad, and 35 civilians, according to Lebanon security sources.

178,Gaza crisis exposes last fig leaf of US double standards,Wang Yan and Zhang Yuanshi,2024-01-02,"As the Palestine-Israel conflict drags on, in a clear pro-Israel move, the US has formed the Red Sea task force to beef up security in the critical global shipping lane, and Houthi forces in Yemen have vowed to keep up attacks on commercial shipping after the US announced the formation of the coalition. Last week, US helicopters sank three Houthi boats and killed those aboard in the Red Sea after coming under fire. Nonetheless, the White House said it is not seeking a wider conflict.The Red Sea crisis is an extension of the Palestine-Israel conflict, exacerbated by the US' continuous support for Israel. Gaza is facing a human rights disaster. However, the US is shamelessly spreading lies about the lack of human rights in Xinjiang by claiming that the prosperous and developed Xinjiang, where people live and work in peace, is experiencing ""genocide."" In fact, the common goal of the 25 million people in Xinjiang is to enjoy human rights. In 2023, from the eight major industrial clusters to a modern industrial system that reflects Xinjiang's characteristics and strengths, from the core area of the BRI to the China (Xinjiang) Pilot Free Trade Zone, Xinjiang anchored its strategic position in the overall national development plan, made use of its advantages according to local conditions, and promoted the steady and rapid development of various human rights undertakings through high-quality economic development. In 2023, Xinjiang's cotton production reached 5.112 million tons, accounting for over 90 percent of the national total. The people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang are creating a happy life, and working diligently for an advantageous economic environment. However, US politicians pretend not to see the growing economy, the people's well-being and the prosperity of ethnic unity in Xinjiang. Instead, they block the truth, fabricate facts and use human rights as a pretext to launch sanctions to undermine Xinjiang's economic environment, arbitrarily reduce employment opportunities for ethnic minorities, and interfere with the opportunity for the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang to create a better life. They deceive the world with their media advantage and create obstacles that prevent the world from understanding the real Xinjiang in China. They use human rights as a pretext to achieve the sinister conspiracy of containing China through Xinjiang, which is extremely malicious.Instead of actively push for a permanent cease-fire and stop the humanitarian disaster in Gaza, the US considers the economic development and the improvement of the well-being of the people in Xinjiang ""genocide."" The US disregards facts and logic. This deeply reflects the double standards and hypocrisy of its human rights, and the core of this is the hegemonic thinking of the US. As long as the US can gain political capital and not undermine its hegemonic status, it can resort to any means at any cost. The well-being of the people in Xinjiang and the lives of the Palestine people are of no value to the US. Gaza's disaster has exposed the last fig leaf of the US' double standards of human rights.There is a famous Uygur proverb that says, ""Dogs bark, but the caravan goes on!"" Xinjiang will continue to write a new chapter of high-quality development in the field of human rights in a peaceful and harmonious atmosphere.Wang Yan is a professor at Xinjiang Normal University.

179,Israel to partially withdraw forces from Gaza; war to enter new phase amid mounting pressures: analysts,Deng Xiaoci,2024-01-02,"Marking a notable first since hostilities began in October 2023, Israel's military announced the withdrawal of thousands of troops from the besieged Gaza. China analysts on Tuesday said they remain skeptical over the prospects of a cease-fire in the near future, and they argue that the move is intended to buy time for Israel authorities to reassess the domestic repercussions of their offensive, respond to increasing pressure from their principal ally, the US, and address growing international concerns over the escalating death toll in Gaza.  Citing an unnamed Israel official, Reuters reported on Monday that Israel is withdrawing some forces from Gaza to shift to more targeted operations against Hamas, and is partially returning reservists to civilian life to help the economy as the war looks set to last well into the new year. The official said toppling the Islamist faction remains an objective of the offensive in the Palestine enclave, and that some of the five brigades withdrawn will prepare for a possible flare-up of a second front against Hezbollah in Lebanon.According to analysis by Song Zhongping, a military expert and TV commentator, the Israel military's ""reconfiguration"" of forces signals that Israel needs time to reassess its strategy in the Gaza region. ""This includes whether it can quickly control Gaza, or face the risk of Gaza spiraling out of control again, as well as the costs of completely controlling Gaza, encompassing economic and military expenses, casualties and the rising death toll of Palestine civilians, which brings increasingly unfavorable international public opinion pressure,"" Song noted.Song told the Global Times on Tuesday that it is unlikely that Israel will shift its focus to the battlefield with Hezbollah in the northern border area, but it will continue to concentrate on military activities in the Gaza region, while taking on the Hezbollah and the Houthi group on different fronts.Although Israel has announced a partial troop withdrawal, the possibility of a short-term cease-fire is next to zero. Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu needs time to contemplate how to address these issues and how to handle internal and international pressures, especially from its main ally the US, as Washington has been pressuring Israel to lower the intensity of the war, and a complete sabotage of the US' Middle East strategy due to Israel's reckless military operation is also at odds with Washington's desires, Song pointed out. Unresolved hostage issues would significantly test Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at home. Hamas is also strengthening its ability to wage a prolonged war. The convergence of Hamas with other Palestine political factions is bad news for Israel, analysts said. Separately on Monday, the US announced that it would be taking an aircraft carrier strike group back from the eastern Mediterranean and replacing it with an amphibious assault ship and accompanying warships, Reuters reported. With tanks and troops having now overrun much of the Gaza, largely asserting control despite Palestine gunmen continuing their ambushes from hidden tunnels and bunkers, the military is moving to the third stage, an Israel official, who could not be named given the sensitivity of the issue, told Reuters.""This will take six months at least, and involve intense mopping-up missions against the terrorists. No one is talking about doves of peace being flown from Shujayea,"" the official was quoted as saying, referring to a Gaza district ravaged by fighting.China observers warned that such so-called mopping-up involves gradually identifying and eliminating Hamas's potential strongholds in the entire Gaza. This stage could be the most challenging and time-consuming. It would help reduce the Israel's cost of military operations and lives of soldiers, and transitioning to such an operational phase is both a subjective choice on their part and a result of being forced into it. The previous ground military operations did not meet their expectations, both in terms of progress and effectiveness, Zhu Yongbiao, executive director of the Research Center for the Belt and Road at Lanzhou University, told the Global Times on Tuesday. On the contrary, they suffered many negative impacts and factors, possibly due to inadequate preparation. At this stage, they hope to adopt a new mode of warfare to avoid further embarrassment and unfavorable outcomes brought by large-scale ground military operations. They aim to prevent a worse outcome by being prepared and formulating strategies, Zhu noted.",WORLD,MID-EAST,"A boy walks among the rubble after an Israeli airstrike in the southern Gaza Strip city of Rafah, on Dec. 26, 2023.

180,Philippines unlikely to gain support from other ASEAN countries for its S.China Sea provocative approach,Global Times,2024-01-01,"Editor's Note:In 2023, the world continued to witness significant changes and turbulence. As we have entered into 2024, we conducted in-depth interviews with leading strategists from various countries and regions to gather their perspectives on the prominent global issues of 2023 and China's role in addressing them as well as their expectations for China in 2024.In the fourth piece of the series, Koh King Kee (Koh), president of Center for New Inclusive Asia, a non-government Malaysian think tank, shared his thoughts with Global Times (Global Times) reporter Li Aixin on China's diplomacy, the development of China-ASEAN ties and the situation in the South China Sea.Global Times: Looking back at 2023, what diplomatic achievements of China impressed you the most?Koh: The Third Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation held in Beijing on October 17 and 18, 2023, commemorating the 10th anniversary of BRI is without question the most important diplomatic event of the year for China. With the theme ""High-quality Belt and Road Cooperation, Together for Common Development and Prosperity,"" the forum was attended by representatives from more than 150 countries and over 30 international organizations.Over the last decade, the BRI has evolved from a connectivity project, based on the concept and spirit of the ancient Silk Road, into an inclusive global cooperation partnership led and driven by China, but shared and owned by all partner countries. The BRI has become a platform through which China shares its technology, development experience, contributing to the realization of the UN Sustainable Development Goals. It is a concrete manifestation of China's peaceful rise. China's successful mediation of the Saudi Arabia-Iran detente in March 2023 is another notable diplomatic achievement that tacitly reflects China's growing influence on the global stage. This diplomatic feat, which surprised the West, will foster the collective rise of the Muslim world and potentially change the global power dynamics in the post-Ukraine war era. It is indisputable that China-US bilateral relations play a crucial role in shaping the world order. The Xi Jinping-Joe Biden meeting in San Francisco in November, 2023, stopped further decline in US-China relations and paved the way for the normalization of strained relations. Channels of communication for trade and military between the two countries have now been restored, and people-to-people exchanges are encouraged. 

Koh King Kee Photo: Courtesy of KohGT: How do you see China's role in resolving the Russia-Ukraine and Palestine-Israel conflicts?Koh: China is pro-peace. It supports the UN Charter in safeguarding the territorial integrity of states and has always called for peaceful settlement of conflicts through negotiation.In March 2023, China presented a 12-point proposal for a peace settlement in Ukraine, which includes guarantees for the export of grain and assistance to the post-war reconstruction of Ukraine. China has also called for a ceasefire of the Palestine-Israel conflict and an end to the sufferings of the people of Gaza.In the hyperconnected world of the 21st century, both physically and digitally, there is no spatial limit to the impact and repercussions of any conflict anywhere in the world. As a global power and a pillar of the international system, China has the standing and capacity to play a meaningful, effectual and constructive role in finding a solution to these conflicts.Global Times: The Palestine-Israel conflict can be considered a ""black swan"" event in 2023. What event do you predict to be a ""black swan"" or ""grey rhino"" in 2024? Koh: The next ""black swan"" may take place in the Middle East and North Africa region where several hotspots could potentially set off accidental conflicts. As Houthi rebels continue intermittent missile and drone attacks on Israel-connected ships in the Red Sea, commercial vessels are forced to reroute through South Africa, causing international freight to skyrocket, severely disrupting international trade flows. The US-led multinational naval force seeking to combat Houthi attacks could further complicate the situation and reignite widespread terrorist attacks against US and its allies.Meanwhile, the US-Iran tension could escalate into a full-frontal conflict and trigger off another oil crisis.  A recent killing of a high-ranking Iran general in an Israel airstrike in Syria is likely to provoke retaliatory action by Tehran, sparking a regional spillover as Iran-back groups in Yemen, Lebanon, Syria and Iraq launch attacks on Israel and its allies.Global Times: What are the current challenges to global governance? How have the three global initiatives proposed by China contributed to global governance? Koh: The contemporary global governance system has failed to manage the complex issues in today's highly interconnected and interdependent world brought about by globalization, technology advancement and the collective rise of the Global South. The West-dominated global governance system needs reform to reflect the new political and economic realities of the 21st century and take into account the legitimate rights and interests of the developing nations.Humanity is now confronted with unprecedented challenges from climate change, cybersecurity, widespread conflicts and unpredictable outcomes of generative AI. China's three global initiatives, Global Development Initiative, Global Security Initiative and Global Civilization Initiative, are its proposals to address these mounting global issues. These initiatives are the comprehensive practical application of China's concept of global governance - mankind is a community with a shared future.It is unquestionable that peace is the foundation of humanity's persistent pursuit of development. There can be no sustainable development without peace and no peace without sustainable development. China believes that security is the most important global public good, and development is the shared responsibility of all countries.China advocates coexistence, exchange and mutual learning among different civilizations, as no civilization is more superior than any other. All countries should uphold common values of peace, development, equity, justice, democracy and freedom.The global challenges we face today impose an urgent need for a new paradigm of global governance beyond just optimizing the self-interests of nation-states. China's three global initiatives are its answers to the world that is now at the crossroads of history. Global Times: For a long time, ASEAN has insisted on not taking sides in the major power game between China and the US. But the US has been complicating the South China Sea issue. Facing a more complex situation, does ASEAN feel greater pressure? How will ASEAN respond?Koh: ASEAN has always maintained its centrality amid China-US strategic competition. It does not dance to the tune of the big powers.The US is a country thousands of miles away from ASEAN. Its relationship with ASEAN is essentially transactional, mainly serving its geopolitical interests. ASEAN and China are close neighbors with long historical ties. They have been each other's biggest trading partners since 2020. Thus, China and ASEAN are a natural community with a shared future. Their relationship has remained by and large stable, cooperative and friendly overtime, with a few isolated and occasional disruptions and differences due to domestic politics of member states or instigations by external powers.ASEAN and China upgraded their relationship to Comprehensive Strategic Partnership in November 2021, and have started negotiation on the third version of the ASEAN-China Free Trade Agreement. Meanwhile, ASEAN and China have also agreed on the guidelines to accelerate negotiations for the Code of Conduct in the South China Sea.These positive developments are unequivocal testaments of the resilience and maturity of ASEAN-China relations.Global Times: Could a conflict be sparked accidentally in the South China Sea in 2024? Are all parties involved able to control the situation?Koh: The US' China containment strategy is to shape the strategic environment in which China operates. Destabilizing China's surroundings, particularly the South China Sea, has been US' strategic objective.The Philippines, as a US treaty ally, maintains the closest relations with the US among all ASEAN member states. In March 2023, the Philippines further granted the US access and use of another four military bases under the Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement. Many political analysts are of the view that it is no surprise that President Ferdinand Marcos Jr took a more confrontational approach against China in his handling of the South China Sea dispute, taking cognizance of his family's long association with the US. Nevertheless, despite strong verbal exchanges, so far all parties concerned have refrained from taking drastic moves that could trigger the war of words into an accidental conflict, as Beijing is fully aware of the US' motive and that Washington is still mired in the long-drawn proxy war with Russia in Ukraine. Additionally, the Philippines is unlikely to gain support from other ASEAN countries for its provocative approach in the handling of the South China Sea dispute.Global Times: Is it possible that ASEAN's attitude may affect the US, such as embracing the trend of multilateralism?Koh: Historically, the US' core interests lie with EU. Its primary concerns are the Pan-Atlantic relations. However, the US also claims to be an Asia-Pacific power, emphasizing the region's importance to its security and prosperity as it accounts for more than two-thirds of the world economy. Maintaining its dominance in Asia-Pacific is critical to US global hegemony.ASEAN may not have sufficient clout to influence US national policies and global strategy. However, the US will no doubt take ASEAN's stance into consideration when framing is foreign policy, particularly in light of China's rise and its increasing trade relations with ASEAN. In fact, given ASEAN's strategic location, the Indo-Pacific Strategy, a US-designed grand strategy to counter China, will be toothless without the support of ASEAN. The US endorses ASEAN's centrality and respects ASEAN's attitude of not taking sides in the US-China rivalry. So does China. Thus, ASEAN's current attitude amid US-China rivalry appears to align with its best interests.",OPINION,VIEWPOINT,Beijing Photo: VCG,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'China': ('LOC', 13), 'South China Sea': ('LOC', 14), 'Beijing': ('LOC', 1), 'Saudi Arabia': ('LOC', 1), 'Iran': ('LOC', 1), 'Ukraine': ('LOC', 1), 'US': ('LOC', 2), 'San Francisco': ('LOC', 1), 'Koh King Kee': ('PER', 2), 'Li Aixin': ('PER', 1), 'Ko': ('PER', 2), 'Ke': ('PER', 1), 'Center for New Inclusive Asia': ('ORG', 1), 'Global Times': ('ORG', 2), 'ASEAN': ('ORG', 1), 'Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation': ('ORG', 2), 'Malaysian': ('MISC', 1), 'Third': ('MISC', 1), 'BRI': ('MISC', 3), 'Belt': ('MISC', 1), 'Road Cooperation': ('MISC', 1), 'Together': ('MISC', 1), 'Common': ('MISC', 1), 'Silk Road': ('MISC', 1), 'UN Sustainable Development Goals': ('MISC', 1), 'West': ('MISC', 1), 'Muslim': ('MISC', 1), 'Xi Jin': ('MISC', 1)}"
181,Houthi group says 10 fighters killed by US in spillover of Gaza crisis; 'major escalation so far unlikely',Deng Xiaoci,2024-01-01,"The Red Sea - one of the world's most important shipping lanes that links markets in EU with Asia - saw another bloody incident on Sunday with Yemen's Houthi group stating that 10 of its fighters were killed by US naval forces while they were preventing Israel-related ships from passing through the Red Sea, in solidarity and support for the Palestine people.Analysts said the new clash in the waters of the Red Sea is a spillover of the ongoing Palestinian-Israeli Conflict, and although it is unlikely to lead to a major escalation of tensions or the outbreak of a new war in the region, the US should understand that the key to fundamentally addressing the Red Sea issue lies in easing the Palestinian-Israeli Conflict conflict and the humanitarian crisis in the Gaza. According to the Xinhua on Sunday, Houthi military spokesman Yahya Sarea said that US forces attacked three boats belonging to the Houthi group. The spokesman said the US ""bears the consequences of this crime,"" and that the ""military movements in the Red Sea to protect Israel ships will not prevent Yemen (Houthi militia) from performing its humanitarian duty in support of Palestine and Gaza.""According to Al Jazeera on Sunday, helicopters from two US warships - the USS Eisenhower and USS Gravely - shot at the ""Iran-backed Houthi small boats"" in self-defense on Sunday morning while responding to an SOS call from the Singapore-flagged vessel Maersk Hangzhou, the US Central Command (CENTCOM) said.The US helicopters sank three of the boats, killing several of their crew, it said. Zhu Yongbiao, director of the Center for Afghanistan Studies in Lanzhou University, told the Global Times on Monday that after the Sunday turmoil, Houthi forces may continue to carry out small-scale actions, but it is unlikely that they will directly retaliate against or launch aggressive counterattacks on US forces. The use of small boats for harassment may decrease, and more drones and missiles will be used for this purpose, while direct confrontations are very unlikely, the analyst said. ""Such an event will not directly lead to an escalation, as the US military is still in a defensive mode and has not actively struck the Houthi forces. The Sunday event is a major one but not severe enough to become a turning point.""The US on December 19 announced a global naval task force to safeguard shipping in the contentious waters, through which some 12 percent of global trade passes, according to reports from Al Jazeera.China observers pointed out that the clash in the Red Sea is actually a spillover of the Palestinian-Israeli Conflict conflict. ""To fundamentally solve it, it is necessary for the Palestinian-Israeli Conflict issue to be significantly eased, including the humanitarian crisis in the Gaza. Even if aggressive military strategies are adopted, the US may achieve good results in the short term, but they are not a permanent solution, as the root cause lies in the Palestinian-Israeli Conflict conflict,"" they said. The Sunday incident came shortly after UN Secretary-General António Guterres said in a statement via his spokesperson that he was gravely concerned about the further spillover of the conflict, which could have devastating consequences for the entire region, citing continuing attacks by armed groups in Iraq and Syria, as well as the Houthi attacks against vessels in the Red Sea, which have escalated in recent days, according to a transcript of the statement. The Palestine Central Bureau of Statistics said Sunday that more Palestine were killed in conflicts in 2023 than in any other year since 1948.　According to the bureau, 22,404 Palestine died in 2023, and 22,141 of them were killed since the outbreak of the conflict between Israel and the Hamas on October 7, 2023.",CHINA,DIPLOMACY,"An Israeli Navy missile boat is seen in the area of the Red Sea on Nov. 1, 2023.

182,Xinjiang’s harmonious multi-ethnic families debunk Western lies,Qian Jiayin,2024-01-01,"In China, Xinjiang is known for being a beautiful, vast, vibrant place. However, in West media reports, Xinjiang is described as a dangerous place with human rights and forced labor issues for ethnic minorities. Recently, I had the opportunity to visit Xinjiang and was amazed to find that Xinjiang is much more prosperous than I had imagined based on articles and reports. It is easy to sense the social stability, harmony and rapid economic development through the lives and stories of Xinjiang residents.""No matter what ethnicity, we are one family."" This statement comes from a couple living on the Xishan Farm in Urumqi City, Northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region. The wife, named Mian Lisha, is of the Hui ethnic group, while the husband, named Asat Ahmet, is of the Uygur ethnic group. This young couple told me that they have a large family consisting of eight people from five different ethnic groups. In their community, it is common for a family to include multiple ethnicities.""Although our family relationships are complex, I have always felt the love and harmony of a multi-ethnic family,"" Mian told me. Having a multi-ethnic family, Mian and Asat used to worry about the difficulty of integrating the lifestyles of both families. However, after nine years of living together, Mian has learned about the Uygur language, and Asat has adapted to Hui-style cuisine. Most importantly, they celebrate the most important festivals of both the Hui and Uygur ethnicities, such as Eid al-Fitr for the Hui, Roza Festival for the Uygur, and the Spring Festival, together as a family.Nowadays, both Mian and Asat work in the e-commerce industry. In their work, they are able to conduct live streaming and sell products fluently in Putonghua. Mian used to want to leave Xinjiang and work in a big city like Beijing or Shanghai. However, the development of Xinjiang ultimately made her decide to stay in her hometown. The couple believes that the development of internet technology and logistics in Xinjiang has provided a great opportunity for young people in Xinjiang to prosper in the e-commerce industry.Another multi-ethnic family I met in Xinjiang is the family of a 61-year-old Hui woman named Li Caixia. Her family is a traditional Hui family. Three years ago, her daughter fell in love with a Uygur young man. Despite opposition from some older relatives due to their different ethnicities, Li did not think the same way. She told me, ""I cannot oppose them because of their ethnicities, and I don't care about material things either. As long as my daughter loves him, I will agree to their marriage.""Today, multi-ethnic families and the harmonious coexistence of different ethnicities are common in Xinjiang. The Xishan Farm, where Mian and Li live, is home to over 50,000 people from 34 ethnic groups. According to a report from the Administrative Office of Tacheng Prefecture in Xinjiang in 2019, out of 330,000 households in the region, there are over 11,000 households that comprise two or more different ethnic groups. Some communities have around 20 percent multi-ethnic families. Xinjiang has been a multi-ethnic settlement area since ancient times, and people of different ethnicities living here have close interactions with each other. Different ethnic groups can live comfortably and harmoniously in the same family.Over the years, some West anti-China forces have falsely accused Xinjiang of ""human rights violations"" and ""persecution of ethnic minorities."" Behind these accusations lies the ideological bias of West countries, driven by geopolitical and strategic needs. Since May last year, some Germany politicians and international human rights organizations have been hyping up the issue of ""forced labor"" in Volkswagen's Xinjiang factory. Recently, the Volkswagen Group, which has been slandered, issued a statement stating that an independent review commissioned by a human rights consulting firm found no signs or evidence of ""forced labor."" However, this answer has been coldly received in West political and public opinion circles. This made me realize that some West politicians who have been sitting arrogantly on their high horses have moved from arrogance to self-isolation. They refuse to see the true picture of Xinjiang.The British essayist William Hazlitt once wrote that prejudice is the child of ignorance. Some West politicians and media with ulterior motives refuse to accept the true voice of Xinjiang and treat lies as truth. Their absurd remarks make me doubt whether the Xinjiang they talk about and the Xinjiang I have seen are the same place.I visited Xinjiang during the snowy season, which is the peak time for ice-and-snow tourism in the region. I was deeply impressed by the happiness and smiling faces of both the local people and tourists enjoying the snow. I learned that during the 2022-2023 ice and snow season, Xinjiang's S-class ski resorts generated tourism revenue of 229 million yuan ($32.04 million), attracting more than 200 million tourists. Currently, the most popular winter tourist attraction in Xinjiang is Hemu Village in Burqin County, Altay Prefecture, where the per capita net income exceeds 40,000 yuan ($5,598). 10 years ago, the per capita income in this traditional pastoral village was only around 10,000 yuan ($1,399). If Xinjiang, which is now thriving with tourists and experiencing economic development, and where people are enjoying harmony between different ethnic groups, needs West politicians' ""support"" for human rights, then where is their support for the people in the war-torn Gaza, which is full of devastation?The people of Xinjiang have the final say over their human rights. West anti-China forces use the so-called ""human rights violations"" as an excuse to accuse Xinjiang of ""cultural genocide"" and ""ethnic genocide,"" hoping to undermine the unity of various ethnic groups in Xinjiang, but this is wishful thinking. I believe that in Xinjiang, there will be more multi-ethnic families like Mian's and Li's family who believe that ""every ethnic group is China.""The author is a reporter with the Global Times. qianjiayin@globaltimes.com.cn",OPINION,VIEWPOINT,Illustration: Liu Rui /GT,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'China': ('LOC', 1), 'Xinjiang': ('LOC', 10), 'Xishan Farm': ('LOC', 1), 'Urumqi City': ('LOC', 1), 'Northwest China': ('LOC', 2), 'Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region': ('LOC', 11), 'Mia': ('LOC', 1), 'Beijing': ('LOC', 1), 'Shanghai': ('LOC', 1), 'West': ('MISC', 1), 'Hui': ('MISC', 5), 'Uygur': ('MISC', 4), 'Eid al - Fitr': ('MISC', 1), 'Roza Festival': ('MISC', 1), 'Spring Festival': ('MISC', 1), 'Mian Lisha': ('PER', 5), 'Asat Ahmet': ('PER', 4), 'Lixia': ('PER', 1)}"
183,GT investigates: Nearly 90 percent of Chinese respondents believe US lacks sincerity in improving bilateral ties: GT survey,GT staff reporters,2024-01-01,"Editor's Note:The year 2023 witnessed many changes in the international landscape and also saw more voices from the Global South on the global stage. It was also a year in which the US continued to forcefully impose its ideology on other countries, Japan's nuclear-contaminated wastewater dumping was internationally condemned, and the Palestine-Israel conflict broke out, all posing diverse risks to global peace and stability. Conversely, in 2023, China made great strides in economic recovery and diplomacy, and unveiled significant technological breakthroughs. In this year full of uncertainties, what was the common people's perspective on global issues? The Global Times Research Center recently conducted its 18th annual public opinion survey themed ""How China People View the World."" Based on the survey results, China-Russia relations were considered to be the most important neighboring relationship for the fifth consecutive year. At the same time, nearly 90 percent of respondents believe that the US lacks sincerity in improving China-US relations, and more than half of the respondents believe that China should retaliate against US sanctions and targeted moves.This is the second installment of the survey.

Graphic：GTChina-Russia relations rank topThe survey mainly collected data through online questionnaires using member invitations, and was conducted from December 4 to December 15, 2023. The survey sample covered 16 cities in the seven major regions of the China mainland. The survey targeted ordinary China citizens aged between 18 and 69. A total of 1,897 valid questionnaires were collected.In response to the question ""Among the following bilateral relationships, which three do you think are the most important for China at the current stage?"" 58.8 percent of respondents chose ""China-Russia relations,"" while ""China-US relations"" (51.8 percent) and ""China-EU relations"" (38.4 percent) ranked second and third respectively. China-Russia relations have ranked first for three consecutive years according to data. In China's neighboring relations, those with Russia have been the most important for respondents for five consecutive years. This time, with a mention rate of 66.1 percent, it has become the most important neighboring relationship among respondents.Zhao Long, deputy director of the Institute for Global Governance Studies at Shanghai Institutes for International Studies, told the Global Times that multiple factors make the relationship between China and Russia the most important neighboring relationship in the eyes of the public. First, China and Russia are each other's largest neighbors, sharing a border that stretches 4,300 kilometers. The two countries have highly complementary economic structures, with China being Russia's largest trading partner for 13 consecutive years. Bilateral trade increased from $8 billion in the year 2000 to over $200 billion in 2023. Second, China and Russia engage in strategic coordination on major international and regional issues. Finally, the high level of mutual trust and cooperation between China and Russia naturally extends to the promotion of people-to-people exchanges and cooperation, Zhao elaborated.In the face of the current complex international situation, the high-quality strategic cooperation between China and Russia highlights the resilience, vitality, and value of the bilateral relations, which is why the public pays attention to the two neighbors' relationship, he said. In a previous exclusive interview with the Global Times, Russia Ambassador to China Igor Morgulov said that a shifting geopolitical landscape does not affect China-Russia mutual political trust. ""Under the strategic guidance of the leaders of our two countries, Russia-China relations have reached the highest level in history and have the nature of a comprehensive strategic partnership of coordination. The two sides have a high degree of mutual trust, respect each other's interests, and carry out mutually beneficial and close cooperation in all fields. We are good neighbors. There is a China proverb that goes, 'A distant relative is not as good as a close neighbor.'"" Morgulov told the Global Times.Zhao told the Global Times that China and Russia are important forces in promoting a more multipolar world order and the democratization of international relations. The influence of China-Russia relations goes beyond the bilateral scope and is crucial to the world order and the future of humanity. The ""global significance"" of China-Russia relations can be understood multidimensionally through politics, security, and economy. Politically, the two countries can jointly voice their support for international fairness and justice, strategically coordinate their positions on major international and regional issues, and propose plans and initiatives through multilateral platforms such as the UN. In terms of security, China and Russia emphasize the importance of breaking away from the constraints of a Cold War mentality, Zhao said. Additionally, the survey found that 63.3 percent of respondents expressed a desire for the improvement of China-Australia relations in a separate question. Nearly half (49.7 percent) of all respondents expressed hope for a relatively close and friendly relationship between China and Australia, and 13.5 percent hoped for a very close and friendly relationship. Chen Hong, executive director of the Asia Pacific Studies Centre at the East China Normal University, told the Global Times that the current China-Australia relationship is generally stable and shows signs of improvement. This is attributed to the meeting between the leaders of the two countries in Bali and the consensus reached during Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese's visit to China in November 2023. Previous disputes between the two countries are gradually being resolved. It is worth noting that 25.8 percent of respondents prefer for China-Australia relations to remain unchanged. Chen said that this also indicates the extent to which the Morrison administration damaged China-Australia relations in the past. However, overall, China people generally believe that the relationship between China and Australia should not become confrontational. Australia must fully recognize its importance in the eyes of the China people and cherish the hard-won friendly relationship, he said. When compared with the softening tone in China-Australia relations, the survey found that due to the recent provocative actions of the Philippines in the South China Sea that violated international law, 40.6 percent of respondents expressed support for communication and cooperation with the Philippines to ease tensions in the South China Sea, while some 30.3 percent of respondents support taking more or stronger actions against the Philippines. Nearly a quarter of respondents said they supported maintaining the status quo. Chen said that the China government's advocacy for resolving disputes through dialogue and consultation is in line with public opinion. However, if the Philippines persists in its unilateral actions, China will resolutely defend its rights in accordance with the law.

Graphic: Deng Zijun/Global Times US lacks sincerity in improving tiesIn the survey, multiple questions were set regarding the China-US ties.The survey result showed that 63.1 percent of the respondents expressed an unfavorable attitude toward the Joe Biden administration. More than half of the respondents also held a negative view toward Republican and Democratic politicians at 55.3 percent and 53 percent respectively. The proportion of respondents who dislike the Joe Biden administration increased by 3.3 percentage points compared with 2022. The percentage of respondents who dislike the US media reached 43.9 percent, an increase of 5.6 percentage points year-on-year, and the likeability rate was also less than 10 percent. In recent years, the Joe Biden administration has treated China as a strategic competitor and imposed restrictions on China in various areas such as technology and the economy. In this survey, 51.4 percent of the respondents believe that China should retaliate against the US. Nearly 90 percent of respondents expressed they believe that the US lacks sincerity in improving China-US relations.Conversely, respondents still had a relatively favorable view of US film and television productions (48.5 percent) and sports leagues (41.9 percent), but both experienced a decrease in favorability of 11.2 and 8.6 percentage points respectively year-on-year.Qiang Ge, professor at the National Academy of Governance, told the Global Times that the China public has a negative view of Joe Biden administration and the two parties in the US mainly because the US has repeatedly unjustifiably suppressed and demonized China in recent years.  However, many China people still enjoy US sports and film and television products, which precisely shows that the China people do not dislike the country, but rather the US political arena has destroyed goodwill among the China people toward the US. The decline in favorability, to some extent, indicates that people's aversion to US politics has affected their perception of US culture, Qiang said.The survey showed that when asked about their views on US democracy, freedom, and human rights in recent years, over three-quarters of respondents expressed a lack of support or a decrease of the same, an overall increase of 5.3 percentage points year-on-year. Regarding the performance of the US in the current Palestinian-Israeli Conflict, 55.4 percent of the respondents said they believe it is irresponsible, 42.4 percent believe it is unethical, 38.9 percent believe it is unfair, and 36.4 percent believe that the US is hindering an early resolution to the Palestinian-Israeli Conflict.Sun Degang, director of the Center for Middle Eastern Studies at Fudan University, told Global Times that this poll result sends several signals: First, as the so-called hegemonic power in the Middle East, the US has not provided a good solution to the Palestinian-Israeli Conflict, so China respondents feel that the US lacks the ability. Second, civilians in the Gaza are facing a serious humanitarian crisis, but the US continues to exercise its veto power in the UN, providing more time for Israel's military offensive. This reflects US' double standards. Finally, the US stands in opposition to world peace, as indicated by its policy-making that is still driven by self-interest, which will continue to diminish its global appeal, influence, and discourse power.China actively promotes open, inclusive global cooperationThe ""China's International Perspective"" section of the survey reveals the China public's views on the international situation. According to the survey data, 66.9 percent of respondents stated that they watch, read, or listen to international news daily, with 49.6 percent of respondents reporting a frequency of ""1-3 times per day"" in their exposure to international news. Li Long, vice president of the Institute of Public Opinion and Social Governance at South China Normal University, told the Global Times that an increase in international news consumption reflects the increasing international vision of the China people. Currently, China people are paying more attention to China's role and influence in international affairs. According to the survey, 92.4 percent of respondents believe that the BRI (BRI) has increased attention paid to countries which participated in the initiative. ""The support of the China people for their country's foreign policy helps to strengthen China's cooperative relationship with the countries participating in the BRI. It also enables the government to focus on the needs and opinions of the public while promoting fair and sustainable development in bilateral cooperation,"" said Li.At the same time, 96.7 percent of the respondents agreed that the increase in the BRICS countries has a positive significance. In August 2023, during the 15th BRICS Summit, it was announced that Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran, Saudi Arabia, and the United Saudi Arabia Emirates had been invited to join the BRICS cooperation mechanism. Their membership took effect on January 1.Feng Xingke, secretary general of the World Financial Forum and director of the Center for BRICS and Global Governance, told the Global Times that the reason why the respondents were optimistic about the expansion of BRICS is mainly due to the continuous attempts by the US and the West to foment conflict to contain China's development, which has caused strong resentment among the China people.""The BRICS mechanism, on the other hand, despite its different national conditions, systems, and cultures, upholds the spirit of mutual respect and understanding, equality, solidarity, openness, inclusiveness, and consensus. The spirit of win-win cooperation has kept this mechanism alive and benefited every country in it,"" Feng said.The expansion of the BRICS countries will also further deepen the new type of globalization, experts pointed out, noting that the expansion process of the BRICS through including more countries has further strengthened the voice of the Global South. At a rate of 95.1 percent, respondents believe that the Global South may become an important force influencing the global development pattern in the next 10 years.Currently, the global economy is stumbling forward and facing challenges. When asked about their expectations for the global economy over the next year, 58.3 percent of respondents were relatively optimistic, an overall increase of 6.7 percentage points compared with 2022. It is worth noting that 67.0 percent of respondents hold an optimistic attitude toward the future development of the China economy in the next year, with 22.0 percent considering themselves to be ""very optimistic"" while 45.0 percent are ""relatively optimistic."" He Zili, professor at the School of Economics at Nankai University, told the Global Times that China implemented a series of measures to stabilize the economy in the last year, achieving significant results, which is an important reason for the increased confidence in the respondents. ""The position of the China economy in the global economy is becoming increasingly important. Therefore, as long as the China economy continues to recover and improve, there will be more stability in the global economy,"" He said.He pointed out that the digital economy and the intelligent transformation of traditional manufacturing will be the key areas for China's economic focus in the future. According to the survey results, 73.6 percent of respondents expect foreign-funded enterprises to play a role in China's economic development, and foreign-funded enterprises in the health, energy, infrastructure, ecological protection, and new energy vehicle industries are seen as having good prospects in China. China has a huge market demand and policy support in these industries, making it highly attractive to multinational companies. Looking ahead, China will create a better business environment to promote the quality and level of foreign investment utilization in our country, He said.",IN-DEPTH,IN-DEPTH,A view of Beijing Central Business District.

184,More discomfort awaits the West in 2024 if it doesn’t adapt to new reality,Global Times,2024-01-01,"What kind of experience did 2023 bring to West countries? According to mainstream West media, the most apt term to encapsulate the West sentiment is ""uncomfortable.""An article from the BBC suggests that the past 12 months have seen a number of setbacks for the US, EU and other major democracies on the international politics stage. Although none has been disastrous for now, they point to a shifting balance of power away from the US-dominated, West values that have held sway for years, the article claimed. The mentioned setbacks include regional conflicts such as the Russia-Ukraine war and the Israel-Palestine conflict. Challenges posed by countries perceived as adversarial by the US and the West, such as China, Iran, and North Korea, were also highlighted. The Ukraine crisis has continued on, and the Israel-Palestine conflict has reignited, while the responses from the international community don't align with the preferences of the US and its West allies. All of this has made them feel ""uncomfortable."" When it comes to the Russia-Ukraine conflict, despite receiving support from the West, Ukraine has faced difficulties and failed to progress as expected in its conflict with Russia. This has led to West fatigue and frustration. Due to partisan divisions in the US, providing aid to Ukraine has become problematic. In contrast, Russia has managed to stabilize its frontlines and handle the prolonged war effectively, Lü Xiang, a research fellow at the China Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times. He noted that sanctions against Russia, with only around 30 countries participating in condemning Russia's actions, have failed to significantly impact the Russia economy, instead, Russia has demonstrated remarkable resilience, contrary to West expectations.In the case of the Israel-Palestine conflict, most developing countries held positions inconsistent with those of the US. Many countries expressed disappointment and regret over the US veto of the Gaza-related drafts demanding an immediate humanitarian ceasefire in Gaza, distancing themselves from the US pro-Israel stance. The BBC states that Saudi Arabia ministers believe there are double standards in West approaches to the Russia-Ukraine conflict and the Israel-Palestine conflict, accusing the West governments of hypocrisy. This reflects a growing opposition from Global South and developing countries against the values advocated by the US and the West in various events, and the West influence is diminishing, said Yang Xiyu, a senior research fellow at the China Institute of International Studies.Issues such as the Ukraine crisis and the Israel-Palestine conflict increasingly demonstrate that the West, particularly EU and the US, can no longer bring positive values to the world. More and more countries and their people in the Global South have become aware of this and refuse to accept West double standards.Today, an increasing number of developing countries are expressing clear opposition to irresponsible actions by the US and EU. The major demand of these countries is to have a peaceful and stable international environment for national development. However, West countries, the US in particular, are acting as the world's largest disruptor of peace and creator of conflicts. In the cases of the Ukraine crisis and the Israel-Palestine conflict, the US not only fuels the flames but also opposes proposals for peace talks raised by other countries. In pursuit of its selfish interests, the US has caused suffering to the people of Ukraine and the Gaza, hindering the resolution of other urgent global issues. In such circumstances, more and more developing countries are becoming courageous enough to say no to the US and the West.In 2024, the influence and dominance of the West, whether in the Russia-Ukraine conflict or the Israel-Palestine conflict, will continue to decline. If 2023 did not unfold according to their expectations, 2024 is likely to deviate even further. This will bring more discomfort for them. Washington now has to adapt to a new reality: Global South countries are becoming more mature and gaining more decision-making autonomy. US politicians, who are used to dictating terms to countries worldwide and expecting developments to revolve around US interests, must reflect on and adapt to this new change. Otherwise, when the media summarizes 2024, it may not be as simple as just feeling uncomfortable; the experience might be more agonizing.",OPINION,OBSERVER,Illustration: Liu Rui/GT,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'West': ('MISC', 13), 'Saudi': ('MISC', 1), 'BBC': ('ORG', 2), 'EU': ('ORG', 1), 'China Academy of Social Sciences': ('ORG', 1), 'Global Times': ('ORG', 1), 'Xi': ('ORG', 1), 'Institute': ('ORG', 1), 'US': ('LOC', 9), 'Russia': ('LOC', 9), 'Ukraine': ('LOC', 6), 'Israel': ('LOC', 5), 'Palestine': ('LOC', 4), 'China': ('LOC', 2), 'Iran': ('LOC', 1), 'North Korea': ('LOC', 1), 'Gaza': ('LOC', 2), 'Arabia': ('LOC', 1), 'South': ('LOC', 1), 'Lü Xiang': ('PER', 1), 'Yang': ('PER', 1)}"
185,Israel launches missile attack near Aleppo int'l airport in N. Syria,Xinhua,2023-12-31,"Israel launched a missile attack near the international airport of Aleppo city in northern Syria on Saturday, the Syria army said in a statement.The attack was launched to target military points south of Aleppo, resulting in some material losses, the statement said.The Syria Observatory for Human Rights said a missile fell in the area of Aleppo International Airport, causing no damage to the airport.The Britain-based war monitor added that there were six loud explosions near the al-Nayrab military airport east of Aleppo.Farms between the villages of Al-Dhahabiya and Al-Sheikh Saeed in the area were targeted, where are believed to house warehouses and headquarters for Iran militias, according to the observatory.The attack is the latest in a string of Israel assaults on Syria military sites.Earlier in the day, the observatory said 19 pro-Iran fighters, including four Syrians and six Iraqis, were killed, and at least 18 others were critically injured in a midnight Israel strike on Syria's eastern province of Deir al-Zour.It said the attack targeted their positions and a convoy in and on the outskirts of Al-Bukamal city, as well as military headquarters, shipment, and ammunition warehouse near the Syria-Iraqi border.Israel has recently increased its attacks on Syria targets in tandem with its military campaign in the Gaza. On Monday evening, an Israel attack south of the Syria capital of Damascus killed Seyyed Razi Mousavi, who was one of the longest-serving advisers of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) in Syria.At midnight on Thursday-Friday, Israel renewed airstrikes on targets in Damascus, resulting in the suspected killing of 11 IRGC members, according to the observatory.The Syria Foreign Ministry on Friday condemned the Israel attacks and urged decisive measures from the UN to put an end to these assaults.Syria has been engulfed in an over 12-year civil war, with the government forces of President Bashar al-Assad, backed by Russia and Iran, fighting against various opposition groups.Israel, on the other hand, has a long-standing policy of preventing Iran from establishing a military presence in Syria by repeatedly conducting airstrikes to destroy alleged Iran weapons supplies.Fire rises from a site struck by an Israel missile near the Aleppo International Airport in Aleppo city, northern Syria, Dec. 30, 2023.

186,S Africa's genocide accusation to 'plunge Israel into a deeper moral crisis' amid rising concern over risks of conflict spillover,Deng Xiaoci,2023-12-30," As ""the hostilities between Israel and Hamas and other groups in Gaza intensify,"" UN Secretary-General António Guterres said in a latest statement via his spokesperson that he was gravely concerned about the further spillover of the conflict, which could have devastating consequences for the entire region.The UN chief said ""there is a continued risk of wider regional conflagration, the longer the conflict in Gaza continues, given the risk of escalation and miscalculation by multiple actors.""The Secretary-General is increasingly concerned about the spillover effects of the continuing attacks by armed groups in Iraq and Syria, as well as the Houthi attacks against vessels in the Red Sea, which have escalated in recent days, according to a transcript of the statement. Guterres urged all parties to exercise maximum restraint and take urgent steps to de-escalate tensions in the region, reiterating in the statement his call for an immediate humanitarian cease-fire in Gaza and the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages.Deputy Permanent Representative of China to the UN Geng Shuang, said when addressing the UN on local time Friday that the protracted nature of the war would only cause more casualties on both sides.""There is no safe place in Gaza,"" he said, warning that the situation on the ground is not allowing humanitarians to carry out their work and reach people in need with aid.Israel's settlement activities in the West Bank and its continued escalation of raids have eroded the basis of a two-State solution, he added, stressing that Israel must cease all settlement activities and hold perpetrators accountable.He further highlighted the importance of implementing the two-State solution and as well as guaranteeing the fundamental rights of the Palestine people and urged the early resumption of direct negotiations between Palestine and Israel,"" Geng added.South Africa has reportedly filed a case against Israel at the International Court for Justice (ICJ,) accusing it of crimes of genocide against Palestine in Gaza. In an application to the court on Friday, South Africa described Israel's actions in Gaza as ""genocidal in character because they are intended to bring about the destruction of a substantial part of the Palestine national, racial and ethnical group"".South African President Cyril Ramaphosa has compared Israel's policies in Gaza and the occupied West Bank with his country's past apartheid regime of racial segregation imposed by the white-minority rule that ended in 1994, Aljazeera reported on Friday. Israel has rejected South Africa's claims and application to the world court, saying through its Ministry of Foreign Affairs that South Africa ""is calling for the destruction of the State of Israel, and that its ""claim lacks both a factual and a legal basis,"" CNN reported. Xinhua cited the Gaza-based Health Ministry and reported on Friday that least 187 Palestine were killed and 312 others were wounded in Israel air and ground attacks on the Gaza during the past 24 hours. To date, total death toll of Palestine has risen to 21,507 and injuries to 55,915 since the conflict erupted on October 7, the ministry added.The ICJ, also known as the World Court, is a UN civil court that adjudicates disputes between countries. It is distinct from the International Criminal Court (ICC), which prosecutes individuals for war crimes.As members of the UN, both South Africa and Israel are bound by the court.Zhu Yongbiao, executive director of the Research Center for the Belt and Road at Lanzhou University, told the Global Times on Saturday that although such accusation at the ICJ would hardly affect Israel military operation in the Gaza, but it will plunge Israel into a moral crisis and further impact its international image.""Zhu explained that ""it will shake the West concept of human rights and discourse that Israel has long relied upon, exacerbating Israel's predicament on the global stage."" China analysts also pointed out that the risks of spillover of the Palestinian-Israeli Conflict is rising but the scale of such spillover remains unclear. The conflict has already had repercussions beyond Israel and Palestine, affecting various countries and regions including Syria, Yemen, the Red Sea area, and Lebanon, Song Zhongping, a military expert and TV commentator, told the Global Times on Saturday.Moreover, Song highlighted specific incidents that have escalated tensions, such as Israel's assassination of a key Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps military advisor in Syria, saying such event introduces significant uncertainties and demonstrates how the effects of the Israel-Palestine conflict have extended to areas like the Red Sea region and Syria, especially considering their connections to Iran. Zhu said that the scale of spillover would also depend on the attitude of the US and allied countries. ""Once they decide to become offensive, the chance of the war expanding to the whole region will grow considerably.""",WORLD,MID-EAST,Photo: CFP,"Reporter, Beijing",Global Times reporter tracking China's space programs and cutting-edge science and technology projects.,"{'Israel': ('LOC', 7), 'Gaza': ('LOC', 7), 'Iraq': ('LOC', 1), 'Syria': ('LOC', 1), 'Red Sea': ('LOC', 1), 'China': ('LOC', 1), 'West Bank': ('LOC', 2), 'Palestine': ('LOC', 4), 'South Africa': ('LOC', 3), 'Rama': ('LOC', 1), 'Hamas': ('ORG', 1), 'UN': ('ORG', 4), 'António Guterres': ('PER', 2), 'Geng Shuang': ('PER', 2), 'Cyril': ('PER', 1), 'Houthi': ('MISC', 1), 'African': ('MISC', 1)}"
187,Xi stresses fostering new dynamics in ties with world,Yang Sheng,2023-12-29,"China concluded the latest Central Conference on Work Relating to Foreign Affairs on Thursday, with the participation of top leaders and senior officials covering the Party and central and local governments, as well as all departments and agencies related to foreign affairs. This conference, held at the end of 2023, the first year that the guiding principles of the 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China are implemented, will guide the direction of China's work relating to foreign affairs on the new journey, experts noted. The last conference of this kind was held in 2018.  The Central Conference on Work Relating to Foreign Affairs was held in Beijing on December 27-28. Xi Jinping, general secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC), China president and chairman of the Central Military Commission, attended the conference and delivered an important address, according to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. In his important address, Xi Jinping presented a systematic review of the historic achievements and valuable experience of major-country diplomacy with China characteristics in the new era, gave a profound exposition on the international environment and historical mission of China's external work on the new journey, and made comprehensive plans for China's external work for the present and coming periods.

We have taken a holistic approach to our relations with all parties, with a view to fostering major-country dynamics featuring peaceful coexistence, overall stability and balanced development,"" Xi Jinping noted. Cui Hongjian, professor of the Academy of Regional and Global Governance at Beijing Foreign Studies University, told the Global Times on Thursday that ""when dealing with other major powers, China now has its own position, stance and firmness, rather than blindly following other major powers. Whether it's in ties with the US or the EU, we have all eased the previous tensions.""During this process, China has not been intimidated by bullying and pressure from others, and ""we are pushing forward the construction of ties with other major powers,"" Cui noted.

We have found a path that not only fits China's own interests but also serves the shared interests of the international community."" In addition, China also contributes to the mediation of conflicts and tensions, evidenced by the China-brokered agreement between Saudi Arabia and Iran on the restoration of diplomatic relations, one of the key contributions that China has made to a world in turbulence, Cui said.  Major challenges In the past five years, the achievements in the field of foreign affairs work that China has made have helped it to overcome a series of challenges, including the US-launched trade war in 2018, the COVID-19 pandemic, and the disruption to supply and industrial chains after the outbreak of Ukraine crisis, said experts. It was underlined at the conference that in the decade of the new era, we have seen high winds and choppy waters and overcome various difficulties and challenges in China's external work. We have opened up new prospects in major-country diplomacy with China characteristics, and gained much more strategic autonomy and initiative in our diplomacy. China has become a responsible major country with enhanced international influence, stronger capacity to steer new endeavors, and greater moral appeal, according to the China Foreign Ministry.

File Photo:VCGLi Haidong, a professor at the China Foreign Affairs University, told the Global Times on Thursday that ""the most important outcome of the last foreign affairs conference in 2018 is that it established the guiding position of Xi Jinping thought on diplomacy. This allows China's diplomacy to play the role of a major engine for global recovery and become a key stabilizer of world peace in general during the profound changes in the world unseen in the past century.""The ongoing Ukraine crisis and the latest round of the Palestine-Israel conflict in Gaza all indicate that the world is at a ""turning point,"" as ""we, China and many of China's partners, want the world to turn to a direction of building a global community of shared future, but a few countries want to separate the world into blocs and alliances who play a zero-sum game with each other, and to impose nationalism, isolationism and protectionism when governing their own countries, rather than keep pushing and reforming the economic globalization,"" Li noted. It was noted at the conference that great transformation is accelerating across the world. Changes of the world, of our times, and of historical significance are unfolding like never before, and the world has entered a new period of turbulence and transformation. Yet the overall direction of human development and progress will not change, the overall dynamics of world history moving forward amid twists and turns will not change, and the overall trend toward a shared future for the international community will not change. We must have full confidence in these trends of historical impact, the conference noted. Future tasksIt was highlighted at the conference that looking ahead, China faces new strategic opportunities in its development. On the new journey, major-country diplomacy with China characteristics will enter a new stage where much more can be accomplished. ""We must focus on the central task of the CPC and the country, seek progress while maintaining stability, break new ground while upholding fundamental principles, and firmly safeguard China's sovereignty, security and development interests. We will explore new frontiers in China's diplomatic theory and practice, foster new dynamics in the relations between China and the world, and raise China's international influence, appeal and power to shape events to a new level,"" the conference noted. ""We will create a more favorable international environment and provide more solid strategic support for building China into a great modern socialist country in all respects and advancing the great rejuvenation of the China nation on all fronts through the China path to modernization,"" the conference highlighted.China analysts said that in the future, China will still serve as a responsible power and a stabilizer for the international system, and push for reform and improvements in the current international order and economic globalization in a constructive way.""We are now standing on a higher position, and our vision has also reached new heights. The international community has higher expectations of us when dealing with global challenges and hot spot issues,"" so this makes our work more important and honorable, but also more difficult and complex, as we need to learn to deal with more forces, to take more responsibilities, and handle more cases that we have never had before, Cui said. ""We need to have an overall review of our work relating to foreign affairs, in terms of mindsets, frameworks and paths, so that we can come up with new ideas and approaches that can fit new demands and new changes,"" Cui noted.",CHINA,DIPLOMACY,"Xi Jinping, general secretary of the Communist Party of China Central Committee, Chinese president and chairman of the Central Military Commission, delivers an important speech at the Central Conference on Work Relating to Foreign Affairs in Beijing, capital of China.

188,China stepping into 2024 with confidence and strength: Global Times editorial,Global Times,2023-12-29,"2024 is upon us, and its emerging outline is worth looking forward to. Meanwhile, 2023 will soon come to an end, and its ups and downs have filled us with loads of emotions. People have gained a deeper understanding and more experiences with major changes unseen in a century that are evolving faster: from the prolonged Russia-Ukraine conflict to the new round of the Palestine-Israel conflict; from the historic expansion of the BRICS to the strong rise of the concept of the ""Global South"" in international politics; from the global AI wave led by ChatGPT to the historic agreement reached at the COP28 to ""move away from fossil fuels.""It is expected that 2024 will not be another ""year of mediocrity."" According to incomplete statistics, in 2024, 76 countries and regions around the world will hold general elections, and more than 100 election campaigns will take place, covering more than half of the global population. This may mean more uncertainty and even the possibility of unexpected conflict and unrest. At the same time, it is still unknown if the Russia-Ukraine conflict and the Palestine-Israel conflict can end next year, while the risk of geo-economic fragmentation, the ""decoupling"" and ""de-risking"" will bring more uncertainty to the global economic recovery process.However, whether it is 2023 full of changes and turmoil, or 2024, which may be an even more volatile year, we can still see some of the basic veins of the direction of history behind the changes and uncertainties. Although the great adjustment of the international landscape is still underway, and the intensity of the great power game will increase, the trend of the international landscape moving toward multipolarity in general has strengthened rather than weakened over the past year, and the driving force has increased rather than decreased. Although some countries have been enhancing trade-restrictive measures, and economic globalization has a tendency to slip into the wrong path of pan-politicization, pan-securitization and alignment, the market logic of win-win cooperation is still dominant, and the stabilization and preservation of coupling still have the upper hand in terms of strength and morality.In particular, in response to a series of major problems and challenges facing the world today, China advocates equal and orderly multipolarity as well as inclusive economic globalization and has always stood on the right side of history. In 2023, China's economy has withstood external pressures and overcome internal difficulties, with high-quality development being advanced solidly and a firm step forward taken in building a great modern socialist country in all respects. Perhaps there is a gap between the actual outcomes of 2023 on one side and the expectations of some people at the beginning of this year and some people's personal feelings on the other. But it must be seen that China's development is faced with more favorable conditions than unfavorable ones, and that the basic trend of the China economy's rebound and improvement and China's sound economic growth in the long run will remain unchanged. This gives us more confidence and strength to move forward.Such confidence and strength stem from the accelerated progress of China's high-level opening-up. In 2023, China responded to the US' ""small yard, high fence"" with a higher level of openness, from the third Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation to large-scale events including the Canton Fair, China International Import Expo, China International Fair for Trade in Services, China International Consumer Products Expo, the Global Digital Trade Expo, and the China International Supply Chain Expo. This pattern is expected to persist and expand in 2024.Such confidence and strength stem from the new advantages created by the continuous emergence of the new dynamics of development in China. In 2023, strategic emerging industries, represented by new-generation information technology, biotechnology, high-end equipment, and green environmental protection, have developed rapidly in China. The export share of new-energy vehicles, PV and lithium battery products - known as China's ""new three items"" - has significantly increased. Products with high technology and high added value and those that lead the green transformation have become new drivers of export growth. The concerted efforts of the China people in technological innovation are bearing fruit on a large scale.Such confidence and strength stem from China's new achievements amid the complex and turbulent external environment. In 2023, China's international influence, appeal, and shaping power have significantly increased: from the talks between China and Russia top leaders at the Kremlin to the summit meeting between the heads of state of China and the US in San Francisco; from successfully mediating the restoration of diplomatic ties between Saudi Arabia and Iran to actively promoting the expansion of the BRICS; from leading bilateral relations to orchestrating multilateral diplomacy; from closely interacting with major powers to deepening South-South cooperation. China's Global Development Initiative, Global Security Initiative, and Global Civilization Initiative continue to receive broad support and positive responses from the international community.Such confidence and strength stem from the pragmatic and hardworking nature of the China people and their aspirations for a better life. China people aspire to live better lives and are willing to continuously exert tangible efforts toward this goal. This determination is the fundamental driving force for the ongoing development of China society. At a strategic level, it manifests as the unwavering commitment to advance China modernization, considering it as the ""ultimate political goal."" In terms of development logic, it is reflected in the concentrated efforts to manage internal affairs effectively and promote China modernization through high-quality development.Meanwhile, we understand that happiness is achieved through hard work and solid efforts, and no one expects 2024 to be easy and smooth sailing. However, we believe that in response to the questions of China, of the world, of the people and of the times, millions of China people, united under the banner of the Party, will stand together like ""a solid piece of steel."" With tenacity and unwavering efforts, we are confident that the answers we provide will undoubtedly be outstanding.",OPINION,EDITORIAL,Hopeful new year.

The Palestine-Israel conflict has again drawn the US into another Middle East crisis, whilst chaotic US domestic politics exacerbated by the country's domestic polarization, continues to create uncertainty and cast a dark shadow across the world.  The protracted Russia-Ukraine conflict unnerves EU, and it's finding it more difficult to grapple with the supply of weapons to Ukraine. In addition, the continent is battered with financial and industrial setbacks, as well as rising far-right forces.Amid such a turbulent background, China has as always been trying its best to play an impartial and active role in mediating conflicts, as well as contribute its wisdom to promote peace around the globe. Moreover, it has also managed to inject much-needed positive energy and stability to the world's sluggish economy. China observers said China has entered a key juncture of development due to profound global changes. As the country's rapid development in the past decades is partly thanks to a stable and peaceful surrounding environment, and as such environment is in jeopardy, the country must create by itself favorable conditions for its new phase of high-quality development, said experts. Record-breaking attendees participated in this year's Beijing Xiangshan Forum held in October. It is a major platform currently able to receive attendees from Russia, Ukraine, Israel and Iran, especially after the outbreaks of the Ukraine crisis and the latest Palestine-Israel conflict. Senior Colonel Zhao Xiaozhuo, deputy director of the Beijing Xiangshan Forum Secretariat, said that all participants of the forum, no matter which country they came from, shared similar expectations toward China, that is for Beijing to get more involved in mediating and solving global issues. Zhao told the Global Times it is not only because of China's rising strength, but also because China has always been a peacekeeper and peace builder internationally. ""Just look around, crisis and conflicts stretched from EU to the Middle East, to Africa. But peace is thriving in the Asia-Pacific region because China has played a significant role in keeping such peace,"" said Zhao. He noted that it is not because the region is trouble-free; it is because China, as a regional great power, advocates peace.In retrospect, China's efforts to promote peace have come to fruition in 2023, a year mired in conflicts and confrontation. In March, after years of hostility, Saudi Arabia and Iran agreed to restore diplomatic ties after talks facilitated by China, a significant development for the two nations and a boon to the security and stability of the Middle East.In October, the third Belt and Road Forum (BRF) for International Cooperation was successfully held in Beijing. Representatives from more than 110 countries attended the forum and a total of 458 outcomes were achieved, far more than the second BRF. In San Francisco in November, China and US leaders concluded a significant China-US summit, which experts said set the direction for a healthy, stable, and sustainable development of China-US relations, which is also a sign of relief for the world.  China President Xi Jinping meets with U.S. President Joe Biden at Filoli Estate in the U.S. state of California, Nov. 15, 2023.(Photo: Xinhua)Among the various challenges and problems we're facing right now, the China-US relationship is the most significant one. The recent meeting between the two heads of state in San Francisco has provided confidence in the strategic stability of bilateral relations, China People's Liberation Army (PLA) Navy rear admiral Yang Yi told the Global Times. However, he noted that this confidence alone cannot solve the fundamental contradictions between the two countries.After the meeting between heads of state from China and the US, Washington did not stop its attempt to thwart China's development. Last month, the militaries of the Philippines and the US launched joint patrols in waters near the island of Taiwan, Reuters reported, noting this could be a move to ""fan further tension with China.""The US crackdown on China in all fronts including in trade, tech and other fields and stirring up trouble near China's doorstep has made China observers see China-US rivalry as the main contradiction influencing the current situation. Jin Canrong, associate dean of the School of International Studies at the Renmin University of China, told the Global Times that in the face of pressure from the US, as long as China maintains domestic development and stability, it can handle the situation well. Zhao said that in the past 40 years, China's rapid development has largely attributed to a peaceful and stable environment. However, currently such environment has been spoiled, and China should build and is capable of building a peaceful environment for itself, for another phase of rapid development. Engine of global economic growth In 2023, China's economy has also rebounded and is progressing toward high-quality development. In the first three quarters of 2023, China's GDP grew by 5.2 percent to 91.3 trillion yuan ($12.5 trillion), maintaining a leading position among major global economies in terms of growth rate.Experts said China's overall economic recovery this year has laid a solid foundation for achieving the annual economic growth target of around 5 percent. With stable policies and strong growth momentum, China has become a source of confidence in driving sustainable global economic recovery.Cao Heping, an economist at Peking University, said that if China's economy grows by around 5 percent in 2023, its GDP will reach 127 trillion yuan, accounting for approximately 18 percent of the global economy.  This photo taken on Nov. 3, 2023 shows a night view of Shanghai, east China. The 6th China International Import Expo (CIIE) is scheduled to be held in Shanghai from Nov. 5 to 10. The expo showcases China's new development paradigm, a platform for high-standard opening up, and a public good for the whole world. (Photo: Xinhua)""China's contribution to the world economy is significant. In contrast to the excessive issuance of currency by the US, China's stable policies have led to affordable goods and made tangible contributions to the world,"" Cao told the Global Times.Recently, several international organizations and financial institutions have raised their forecasts for China's economy. The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has raised its growth forecast for China this year to 5.2 percent, while the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has raised it to 5.4 percent. The IMF predicted that China's contribution to global economic growth this year will exceed 30 percent, solidifying its role as an important engine for stable global economic growth.""Our research shows that faster growth in China also has positive spillovers on the rest of the world. For example, a 1 percentage point increase in growth in China would, on average, increase the level of output in other economies by 0.3 percent over the medium term. This illustrates how strong growth in China is good for China while also providing a welcome lift to global demand,"" Steven Alan Barnett, senior IMF resident representative in China, told the Global Times in an exclusive interview early this month.China will see more favorable conditions than unfavorable ones for economic development next year and China's economic development still has enormous opportunities despite sluggish global growth and insufficient domestic demand, according to an official of the Office of the Central Committee for Financial and Economic Affairs.As social expectation gradually improves, high savings will help boost consumption and investment. A series of government policies, including the issuance of 1 trillion yuan in additional government bonds, reductions in interest rates and reserve requirement ratios, and tax and fee cuts, will continue to take effect next year, the official said.",CHINA,POLITICS,"A flag-raising ceremony to celebrate the 74th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China is held at the Tian'anmen Square in Beijing, capital of China, Oct. 1, 2023.(Photo: Xinhua)",Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'Palestine': ('LOC', 2), 'Israel': ('LOC', 3), 'US': ('LOC', 2), 'Middle East': ('LOC', 2), 'Russia': ('LOC', 2), 'Ukraine': ('LOC', 4), 'China': ('LOC', 9), 'Iran': ('LOC', 1), 'Beijing': ('LOC', 1), 'Africa': ('LOC', 1), 'Asia': ('LOC', 1), 'Pacific': ('LOC', 1), 'EU': ('ORG', 2), 'Beijing Xiangshan': ('ORG', 1), 'Beijing Xiangshan Forum Secretariat': ('ORG', 1), 'Global Times': ('ORG', 1), 'Forum': ('MISC', 1), 'Zhao Xiaozhuo': ('PER', 3)}"
190,Final Ukraine aid package of year makes US' pledge embarrassing,Global Times,2023-12-28,"According to CNN, the US State Department announced the last such package the US will provide to Ukraine until Congress approves the Joe Biden administration's funding requests. Pentagon spokesperson Garron Garn stated that the funds allocated for replenishing US stockpiles had run out. The Joe Biden administration's commitment to aid Ukraine is in a ridiculous and embarrassing situation.The Washington Post reported on Wednesday that the fact that the Joe Biden administration failed to push for congressional approval of funding for Ukraine underscores Joe Biden's ""failure to convince congressional skeptics that America's interests lie in ensuring Moscow cannot prevail in the war."" This also indicates that the main target of the West alliance led by the US in the Russia-Ukraine conflict is Russia.In this conflict, the US is undoubtedly the biggest beneficiary. Cui Heng, a scholar from the China National Institute for SCO International Exchange and Judicial Cooperation, told the Global Times that the US has strengthened its control over EU and Asia-Pacific allies through the Russia-Ukraine conflict, reaching the peak of its control over the West world since the Cold War, and the US no longer needs to worry about the EU challenging its position.Ukraine has been able to hold on until today mainly with the help of the US. Li Haidong, a professor at the China Foreign Affairs University, believes that on the one hand, the US government hopes to fuel the fire in the Russia-Ukraine conflict by increasing military aid to Ukraine, but on the other hand, it is constrained by Congress and faces difficulties in ensuring follow-up funding. The overall policy of the US toward the Russia-Ukraine conflict is caught in a dilemma. At the same time, it is becoming increasingly difficult for the US Congress to pass aid to Ukraine, and the aid program is finding it harder to gain support from war-weary US voters. In particular, the Palestine-Israel conflict has distracted the attention of the US ruling elite from supporting Ukraine.Despite facing setbacks, experts believe the possibility of the US government stopping aid to Ukraine is unlikely. US aid to Ukraine has a demonstration effect, and if the US was to stop aid, EU countries would also follow suit. Li believes the US and EU aid to Ukraine is a game, where if the US reduced its aid, it would force EU countries to provide more assistance to Ukraine. For EU, six countries have not joined the Declaration on Security Guarantees for Ukraine. Cui believes that EU may learn from the US approach and provide small-scale aid while prolonging the duration of each assistance.Ultimately, the game between the US and EU in aiding Ukraine is that the purpose of the aid is not to defend Ukraine but to consume Russia. Ukraine is seen as a ""consumable product"" in the eyes of the West, and no country will pay a higher price for Ukraine's security. This once again demonstrates the sad reality: Ukraine is the biggest loser in the entire conflict.Ukraine's progress on the battlefield has stalled, and the West is increasingly realizing that the Russia-Ukraine conflict won't exhaust Russia as much as it expects and that victory is far from certain. The attitude toward the Russia-Ukraine conflict is becoming increasingly divided within the US and EU, with a growing trend to reduce aid to Ukraine and more countries in EU advocating for cease-fire negotiations in Ukraine. However, the prospects for peaceful negotiations between Russia and Ukraine are pessimistic.As the biggest instigator of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, Joe Biden's administration originally wanted to use Ukraine's victory as a diplomatic achievement, but the current stalemate of the conflict has become a liability in the election campaign. Analysts believe that there is limited room for policy adjustments in Washington regarding the Ukraine crisis before the US election, which means the possibility of Russia-Ukraine negotiations is almost non-existent. The Russia-Ukraine conflict will continue like an unhealed wound for a long time.",OPINION,OBSERVER,Illustration: Liu Rui/GT,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'CNN': ('ORG', 1), 'US State Department': ('ORG', 1), 'Congress': ('ORG', 2), 'Pentagon': ('ORG', 1), 'The Washington Post': ('ORG', 1), 'China National Institute for SCO International Exchange and Judicial Cooperation': ('ORG', 1), 'Global Times': ('ORG', 1), 'EU': ('ORG', 6), 'China Foreign Affairs University': ('ORG', 1), 'US Congress': ('ORG', 3), 'US': ('LOC', 16), 'Ukraine': ('LOC', 16), 'America': ('LOC', 1), 'Moscow': ('LOC', 1), 'Asia': ('LOC', 1), 'Pacific': ('LOC', 1), 'Palestine': ('LOC', 1), 'Israel': ('LOC', 1), 'Joe Biden': ('PER', 4), 'Garron Garn': ('PER', 1), 'Cui Heng': ('PER', 1), 'Li Haidong': ('PER', 2), 'West': ('MISC', 2), 'Russia': ('MISC', 5), 'Cold War': ('MISC', 1), 'G': ('MISC', 1)}"

192,Prolonged Gaza war leads to growing risks of wider regional conflict,GT staff reporters,2023-12-27,"China experts raised concerns on Wednesday about the growing risks of a wider conflict in the Middle East, as Israel's military chief warned that its war on Hamas will likely last for months. Experts said that it is hard to predict when the war will end, but that a prolonged war will be increasingly detrimental to Israel. Israel's Chief of Staff Herzi Halevi told reporters in a televised statement on Tuesday from the Gaza border that the war would go on ""for many months,"" Reuters reported on Wednesday. With Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and other leaders vowing to continue fighting, despite growing international pressure to wind down the battle and calls at home for a deal to free hostages held in Gaza, the military appeared poised for a newly intensified push into the central and southern parts of the Strip, the Times of Israel said. Israel's Defense Minister Yoav Gallant also told Knesset lawmakers on Tuesday that Israel would punish Hamas over its brutal October 7 attack, ""whether it takes months or years.""However, Israel President Isaac Herzog said Israel is willing to agree to a new temporary truce with Hamas in Gaza to secure the release of more captives held by the Palestine group, Al Jazeera reported on December 19.The information coming from Israel is still somewhat chaotic, but it can be broadly divided into two aspects. ""On one hand, there are some efforts in response to international pressure and humanitarian concerns, including humanitarian aid and negotiations for a cease-fire and the exchange of hostages. On the other hand, there is a strong military stance, indicating a determination to continue the conflict,"" Liu Zhongmin, a professor at the Middle East Studies Institute of Shanghai International Studies University, told the Global Times on Wednesday. Still, it may be challenging to predict the end of the Israel-Palestine conflict, Liu noted. ""While the prolonged conflict is increasingly detrimental to Israel, Israel maintained a strong stance to convey its determination, especially to Hamas.""Gallant also warned on Tuesday of a growing risk of a regional conflict in the Middle East as tensions with Iran increase, the Financial Times reported. He told a parliamentary committee that Israel was being attacked in a ""multi-arena war"" from seven areas, which he identified as Gaza, the West Bank, Lebanon, Syria, Iraq, Yemen and Iran.The US said on Tuesday that it had shot down 12 attack drones and five missiles launched by the Houthi militia in Yemen, as the Israel military said a fighter jet successfully shot down a ""hostile aerial target,"" believed to be a drone launched at Israel from Yemen over the Red Sea, the Times of Israel reported. Amid the escalating conflict in the region, Houthi forces also launched an attack on a container ship passing through the Red Sea on Tuesday, which has led several vessels to steer clear of the area, according to media reports. Since late December, we have witnessed new developments in the Israel-Palestine situation. Israel has conducted more precise special operations when striking Hamas in the Gaza, resulting in a narrower range of attacks compared to the indiscriminate bombardment in northern Gaza, Sun Degang, director of the Center for Middle Eastern Studies at Fudan University, told the Global Times on Wednesday.""We can see that the conflicts in the Middle East have evolved, with Saudi Arabia nations and Turkey adopting a generally neutral or detached stance. Therefore, Iran has gradually become the central focus of the conflicts,"" he said. Against this backdrop, the US and Israel are likely to redirect their conflicts. As these conflicts escalate, Israel and the US will seek to portray Iran and its proxies as the primary threat in the Middle East, Sun noted. Some experts believe that the US has become increasingly isolated in its Middle East policy, and especially when it comes to the US-led Red Sea coalition, as regional countries are unwilling to show their support publicly. ""The expansion of the Red Sea crisis is due to the Palestinian-Israeli Conflict conflict, the prolonged military action in Gaza, as well as the support of the US, which is the fundamental cause of the issue,"" Liu said.",CHINA,MILITARY,"People mourn a victim at a hospital in the southern Gaza Strip city of Rafah, on Dec. 26, 2023.

193,US urged to turn its non-support for 'Taiwan independence' commitment into action,Wang Qi,2023-12-27,"The Taiwan Affairs Office under the State Council on Wednesday urged the US to stop arming the island of Taiwan, stop interfering in Taiwan's regional elections, and turn its commitment of non-support for ""Taiwan independence"" into concrete action.The final press conference of the Taiwan Affairs Office in 2023 came against the backdrop of the US' constant military support to the secessionist Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) authorities despite US President Joe Biden's claim that the US does not support ""Taiwan independence."" On December 15, the Pentagon said that it had approved a $300 million sale of military equipment ""to help maintain Taiwan's tactical information systems,"" according to a Reuters report. The US National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year 2024, which was signed into effect on December 22, also vowed more resources to arm the island.Chen Binhua, spokesperson for the Taiwan Affairs Office, said at a press briefing Wednesday that the US' insistence on including Taiwan-related content in the NDAA 2024 is a gross interference in China's internal affairs, representing a serious violation of the one-China principle and the three China-US Joint Communiqués, sending a seriously wrong signal to Taiwan secessionists, and undermining peace and stability in the Taiwan Straits.We express our strong dissatisfaction and resolute opposition to this, Chen said. ""Some people in the US said that they hope for peace and stability in the Taiwan Straits, but in reality, they are speeding up arming Taiwan and inciting confrontation across the Straits,"" he said.We urge the US to abide by its solemn political commitment to China on the Taiwan question, to turn its commitment of non-support for Taiwan independence into concrete action, and to immediately stop arming Taiwan, and stop interfering in Taiwan's regional elections, Chen said.According to Xin Qiang, deputy director of the Center for US Studies at Fudan University, arming Taiwan is actually a gesture of emboldening and encouraging the DPP authorities and its candidate Lai Ching-te, which is a kind of interference and intervention in the island's upcoming election as competition becomes increasingly intense.The US will not change its strategic path to contain China with playing the Taiwan card, nor does it want to see a rapid warming of cross-Straits relations, Xin said.According to the latest election polls released by four agencies in Taiwan on Tuesday, the DPP is leading the race, although some polls show that the candidate from the opposition China Kuomintang (KMT) is narrowing the gap. On December 24, a number of young people took to the streets of Taipei calling for peaceful cross-Straits exchanges and protested against the DPP authorities' policy of extending compulsory military service from four months to one year, which will be implemented on New Year's Day 2024, according to Xinhua. The DPP authorities claim that ""war is not an option for Taiwan,"" but they have stepped up their ""reliance on the US for independence,"" even at the expense of the lives and well-being of the Taiwan people, pandering to US idea of turning Taiwan into a ""powder keg"" and a ""mine island,"" Chen remarked. ""We warn the DPP authorities that 'Taiwan independence' means war,"" Chen said, noting that no matter how many weapons the DPP authorities obtain from the US, ""they will not be able to shake our firm will to resolve the Taiwan question and complete national reunification, nor will they be able to withstand our strong ability to crush attempts of 'Taiwan independence' and safeguard national sovereignty.""The US cannot afford a conflict in the Taiwan Straits right now either, as it has already been sucked into the Russia-Ukraine conflict and the Israel-Palestine conflict, Xin said. ""If the DPP, emboldened by the US' military support, triggers a cross-Straits conflict during its advance toward secession and it drags the US in, the cost and damage for Washington would be unbearable."" With the 2024 presidential election looming on the horizon, Xin said the US needs China's cooperation on climate change, stabilizing the economy, curbing inflation, and drugs control, including fentanyl problems, under a detente atmosphere. If the above are not handled well, or even worse, the two states are drawn into a confrontation because of the Taiwan question, it could affect Joe Biden's reelection prospects, Xin said.",CHINA,POLITICS,"Chen Binhua, a spokesperson for the State Council's Taiwan Affairs Office Photo:VCG","Reporter, Beijing","Global Times reporter covering international affairs, cross-Straits relations and Chinese society; a captive of his experiences.","{'Taiwan Affairs Office': ('ORG', 3), 'State Council': ('ORG', 1), 'Democratic Progressive Party': ('ORG', 1), 'DPP': ('ORG', 3), 'Pentagon': ('ORG', 1), 'Reuters': ('ORG', 1), 'Qi': ('ORG', 1), 'Center': ('ORG', 1), 'US': ('LOC', 9), 'Taiwan': ('LOC', 15), 'China': ('LOC', 5), 'Taiwan Straits': ('LOC', 19), 'Joe Biden': ('PER', 1), 'Chen Binhua': ('PER', 3), 'Xi': ('PER', 2), 'Fu': ('PER', 1), 'Lai Ching': ('PER', 1), 'US National Defense Authorization Act': ('MISC', 1), 'NDAA': ('MISC', 2), 'Year': ('MISC', 1), 'one': ('MISC', 1), 'US Joint Communiq': ('MISC', 1)}"
194,Why isn't Christmas Eve peaceful? The West should ask itself: Global Times editorial,Global Times,2023-12-26,"December 25 is Christmas Day in the West, which is supposed to be the most important and lively festival of the year. But if you look at the headlines of the US and West media on Monday, people feel that ""Christmas Eve is not safe,"" and the due festiveness and peace of the holiday were pushed to the edge of various conflicts and chaos. The ongoing war in Gaza, the shooting at a Colorado mall in the US, the alerts against terrorism in EU, the flooding in Australia, etc. Pope Francis said on Christmas Eve that ""the Prince of Peace is once more rejected by the futile logic of war, by the clash of arms."" This allegorical exclamation was widely spread and touched the heart of the West world.Christmas Eve and Christmas is a time of reunion, tranquility and good tidings in West culture. For the West world, this year's Christmas Eve was indeed full of trouble: the tumultuous atmosphere brought about by the Russia-Ukraine conflict, the Palestinian-Israeli Conflict conflict, and domestic political and social divisions, ""dulls and threatens to suffocate the joy of Christmas."" It would not be an exaggeration to say that this was the most depressing Christmas Eve in the West since the end of the Cold War.However, it is regrettable that although West public opinion lamented the world's insecurity, they could hardly dive into any deep reflection on the reasons why Christmas Eve is no longer peaceful. Instead, they fell into a kind of meaningless wail and complaint. If the lamentations of the West do not touch the soul and are still revolving around ""West-centrism,"" then they will not have any positive effect on the fight for global security.Can't the West perceive the root of its insecurity? It lies within the West itself. In recent years, West countries have not ceased discussing security; many political leaders and public opinions habitually talk about ""derisking."" In pursuit of absolute security, the US-led West invested a considerable amount of manpower, resources, and finances. The proportion of military spending to GDP is generally on the rise. Not only has NATO, a relic of the Cold War, refused to fade away, but the West has also initiated numerous groups worldwide in the name of ""security."" However, despite such significant investments and efforts, the security situation in the West has deteriorated. It has fallen into the paradox where the more they pursue ""security,"" the more insecure they become. The fundamental reason is that the West's approach deviated from the right path from the very beginning.The security pursued by the US and the West is a narrow form of security rooted in conflict and confrontation. When West countries, particularly the US, speak of ""our security,"" the term ""our"" does not encompass all of humanity but is limited to the US-led West. Similarly, when discussing ""maintaining global security,"" it does not genuinely aim to safeguard the security of the entire world but rather to talk about upholding the hegemony of the US and the West.This form of fragmented security, created through military aggression, forming alliances, inciting conflicts, and shifting blame, undermines the common security of the entire world. The narrow and one-sided pursuit of so-called group security by the US and the West, inevitably results in insecurity for other nations. The deterioration of the security situation in other countries, in turn, places the West world in an even more precarious position. This artificially created security opposition only leads all involved parties into a security trap, making everyone increasingly feel insecure.Some public opinions insightfully pointed out that the West, driven by its desire to maintain hegemony, is more inclined to focus on ""crises of others."" However, the West world does not exist in a vacuum - the entire world shares a common destiny. Constantly manufacturing ""crises of others"" also easily sparks one's own crises. The West cannot remain exempt on its own. A Germany auxiliary bishop from Cologne, interviewed by the Associated Press, mentioned that the Cologne Cathedral, which received special attention from police and police dogs on Christmas Eve this year, was ""probably the most secure church service in all of Germany."" This could be taken as a form of self-deprecation, mirroring real security challenges faced in the West.Whether in the West or the East, among developed nations or developing countries, the aspirations of ordinary people boil down to the same thing - a peaceful and prosperous life. No one wishes for warfare to occur in their own country, and nobody wants to witness the emergence of economic or social crises. In this regard, there is a universal sentiment worldwide. The difference lies in the type of ""security"" we seek - whether it is a universally shared security or a comparative security where ""you must be worse off than me."" The diverse starting points often lead to vastly different outcomes.A secure world is a common aspiration of all humanity. Security is not something that falls from the sky. China proposed the Global Security Initiative this year, urging the world to follow a path of pursuing common security. This proposal has rapidly gained enthusiastic responses from the international community, reflecting its timeliness and urgency. On this Christmas Eve that is not so silent, we hope it can lead to more reflection in the West and prompt greater participation from various sides, including West and US societies, in building a path toward common security. In doing so, the world may expect a more hopeful Christmas Eve next year.",OPINION,EDITORIAL,Illustration: Liu Rui/GT,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'Christmas Day': ('MISC', 7), 'West': ('MISC', 15), 'Christmas Eve': ('MISC', 7), 'Russia -': ('MISC', 1), 'Palestinian - Israeli Conflict': ('MISC', 1), 'Cold War': ('MISC', 1), 'US': ('LOC', 3), 'Gaza': ('LOC', 1), 'Colorado': ('LOC', 1), 'Australia': ('LOC', 1), 'Ukraine': ('LOC', 1), 'EU': ('ORG', 1), 'NATO': ('ORG', 1), 'Pope Francis': ('PER', 1), 'Prince of Peace': ('PER', 1)}"

 Israel continued Sunday bombing targets across the Gaza, with both Palestine and Israel sides reporting mounting death tolls.The Israel military said its ground, aerial, and naval forces struck approximately 200 locations in Gaza over the past day. At least 166 Palestine were killed in Israel attacks on Gaza in the last 24 hours, bringing the overall death toll to 20,424, a majority of whom were women and children, the Gaza-based Health Ministry updated Sunday.A total of 15 Israel soldiers were confirmed killed in Gaza over the past weekend, said the Israel army, bringing to 154 the overall number of slain Israel soldiers during its ground offensive in Gaza, which was launched in retaliation for a Hamas assault on Oct. 7 that left about 1,200 Israelis died and more than 200 captivated.Despite acknowledging the ""very heavy price"" on soldiers' lives during the ongoing 78-day offensive, in a video statement, Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu declared, ""We are intensifying the war in the Gaza.""He cautioned that the war would not end soon, stating, ""It will take time."" Netanyahu reiterated that the conclusion of the war is contingent on when Hamas is eliminated and the hostages still held in Gaza are released.Air strikes were carried out also in Jabalia and Sheikh Radwan in northern Gaza. In Khan Younis, the largest city in Gaza, troops were ""expanding their operational hold and killing terrorists in close-quarters combat,"" the Israel military said in a statement.Tens of thousands of Palestine have been wounded since the conflict began, thousands of others are believed to be buried under the rubble of destroyed buildings, and almost all the enclave's population is displaced, as reported by the Gaza-based Health Ministry.Acute food insecurity has been reported too, and according to the ministry, over 90 percent of the population, or about 2.08 million people, were classified in hunger of ""Phase 3 or above,"" meaning they were at hunger levels ranging from ""Crisis"" to ""Catastrophe.""Speaking at a weekly cabinet meeting, Netanyahu denied media reports saying Washington prevented Israel from taking military action in Lebanon.

196,Israel's killing of Iranian military advisor to further complicate regional situation,GT staff reporters,2023-12-26,"
Israel's killing of a senior adviser in Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) is likely to further stimulate anti-Israel and anti-US sentiment in Iran and complicate regional conflicts, as well as the Red Sea situation, said China experts. Sayyed Razi Mousavi, a senior IRGC commander was killed after Israel launched three missiles at his position in the suburbs of the Syria capital of Damascus, Iran's official IRNA news agency quoted an Al Mayadeen correspondent as saying on Monday.Iran President Ebrahim Raisi on Monday extended condolences to the family of Mousavi. Raisi said the ""malicious move by Israel was another indication of its desperation, weakness and helplessness"" in the region, vowing that ""Israel will definitely pay the price for its crime,"" according to a statement published on the website of his office.According to Reuters, IDF (IDF) spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said in response to a reporter's question at a nightly press conference that ""I won't comment on foreign reports, these or others in the Middle East."" ""The Israel military obviously has a job to protect the security interests of Israel.""Mousavi commander was ""responsible for backing up the resistance front in Syria,"" and was one of the comrades of the late Iran commander Qassem Soleimani, who was assassinated in a drone strike near the Baghdad International Airport in January 2020, the IRGC's official news outlet Sepah News quoted an IRGC statement as saying.The statement stressed that Israel ""will pay the price for this crime.""Earlier this month, the IRGC said in a statement that two of its servicemen had been killed by Israel forces ""while conducting an advisory mission in Syria's Islamic resistance front.""The incident came amid fears that Israel-Palestine conflict in Gaza could expand into a wider regional one. Iran is not very likely to take aggressive and direct actions in revenge, as it is not in line with Iran's interests right now. However, this move will further fuel the anti-Israel and anti-US sentiment in Iran, Zhu Yongbiao, executive director of the Research Center for the Belt and Road at Lanzhou University, told the Global Times on Tuesday. Experts said the incident will surely fuel the already tense situation in the region as conflicts between Israel and Hamas, as well as Israel and Hezbollah continue. Moreover, in the Red Sea, attacks by Yemen's Houthi militia against ships connected to Israel have raised concerns over trade route.Iran Foreign Ministry spokesperson Nasser Kanaani on Monday rejected the US accusation that an Iran drone attacked a chemical tanker operating in the Indian Ocean.He made the remarks at a press conference in Tehran while reacting to a Saturday statement by the US Defense Department, in which the US claimed that ""the motor vessel CHEM PLUTO, a Liberia-flagged, Japanese-owned, and Netherlands-operated chemical tanker was struck by a drone fired from Iran."" ""The US accusations are endless,"" Kanaani said.Iran is a key off-court player in the ongoing Israel-Palestine conflict, said Li Shaoxian, director of the China-Saudi Arabia Research Institute at Ningxia University, adding that Iran can exert influence on the Houthi militia. ""Once Iran is further provoked and decides to get involved into the current conflict, it will be a regional war,"" Li warned.The US launched Operation Prosperity Guardian last week in respond to Houthi attacks. But some EU countries, such as Spain refused to participate and the UK agreed only to send a destroyer. Only one Saudi Arabia country, Bahrain, agreed to join. Different countries have varied interests in the Red Sea, making it difficult to form a unified action plan. Moreover, taking hasty actions would only lead to a confrontational situation, said Zhu, adding that countries such as Saudi Arabia are concerned that participation in the US-led patrol task force would risk its relations with Iran and provoke the Houthis.",CHINA,MILITARY,"This undated handout picture released by the Tasnim news agency on December 25, 2023 shows Razi Moussavi, a senior adviser for Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) at an undisclosed location.

198,2023 Yearender: Australia’s future lies in the region and relations with China: former Australian official,Global Times,2023-12-25,"Editor's Note:In 2023, the world continues to witness significant changes and turbulence. As we approach 2024, we conducted in-depth interviews with leading strategists from various countries and regions to gather their perspectives on the prominent global issues of 2023 and China's role in addressing them.In the third piece of the series, John Menadue (Menadue), former Secretary of the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet under Gough Whitlam and Malcolm Fraser and Founder and Editor in Chief of Pearls and Irritations, a public policy journal in Australia, shared his thoughts with Global Times (Global Times) reporter Wang Wenwen on China's diplomacy as well as the development of China-Australia relations in 2023.Global Times: Looking back at 2023, which diplomatic achievements by China have impressed you the most? How do you evaluate China's diplomatic performance?Menadue: I think it's been a very good performance. The progress of the BRI, the expansion of BRICS, and the role of China in bridging the relationship between Saudi Arabia and Iran have all been very substantial achievements.The credit goes to China. Its diplomatic clout has been improved, while America continues to make awful mistakes. The US is clearly losing influence in the Global South. China is taking a great interest and is assisting the Global South. The Global South is watching what America has done in Ukraine and now in Gaza. During the COVID-19 period, the West, and particularly the US, turned its back on the Global South, even when it had a surplus of vaccines. It didn't supply or give any assistance to the poor countries in the Global South.There are the historical reasons why US leadership, even its moral leadership, has been declining dramatically in the last few years. China has clearly stepped up in the areas that I mentioned. China should be quite pleased with the progress it has been making. But obviously there are major concerns about what's happening in the South China Sea, continuing provocations over Taiwan question. There's a lot of diplomacy still required from China.  Global Times: The Palestine-Israel conflict can be said to be the black swan event of 2023. What black swan or gray rhino event do you predict for 2024? Where will the next hotspot issues worthy of our attention be?Menadue: Maybe Taiwan. The US is likely to continue to provoke China, but I hope and expect that China will be patient, and that issue will resolve itself peacefully over time. I hope there's not a black swan event. I don't think there will be one.Global Times: China-Australia relations achieved a breakthrough in 2023. Why do you think an ice-breaking could be achieved?Menadue: On the Australian side, I think there was a change in the language. Language can be very political. With the previous government, the language was quite hostile to China. The new government of Albanese changed that. I don't think there's been a great change on the Australian side of any substance, but the language has improved. The new government spoke about stabilization of the relationship.For Australia, the economy is the main factor. China is a major market. About 30 percent of our exports go to China. That's still very strong. And China is keen to stabilize that economic relationship, particularly now as China is becoming the major world exporter of motor vehicles. These exports have now surpassed Japan, South Korea and Germany.As the major world exporter of cars, China needs iron, steel and lithium for batteries. So the economic relationship is important for China as well. China has got through some economic difficulties particularly in property. But it has developed significant new markets in Southeast Asia, Latin America and the Middle East. It has developed those markets not just for motor vehicles, but for other machinery and solar panels. China still depends on Australian raw materials.They are the factors which have helped improve the relationship, but it's still very much economic. There are a lot of other issues which will need to be addressed.On the China side, there was a softer diplomatic tone coming through from China. A number of the trade restrictions were progressively removed or reduced. That explains the reasons on both sides for the change. But in substance, the relationship still has a lot of work that needs to be done. The principal issue is a very dependent relationship that Australia has on the United States in strategic issues. That is an issue we have to resolve in Australia, but it also matters to important relationships not just with China, but with countries in our region.Global Times: To what extent will Australia's China policy be constrained by the US?Menadue: That's going to be a continuing problem. China is being very patient with us. We act as a proxy in Asia for the United States. And we're increasingly being drawn into the US, not just politically, but also strategically, with US bases in Australia, with submarines, with the cooperation on intelligence and security matters.An increasing number of Australians see that as a dangerous course for Australia, that we are ceding our sovereignty to another country. That is proceeding apace and is quite serious for us. That's my view, but not all Australians share this view. Unfortunately the present government, I think, is allowing itself to be led into that closer strategic relationship with the US. Historically, there are various reasons for this. This is of concern, and is something we need to address in Australia, not just for our own sake, but also for relations with China and other important countries in the region, such as Indonesia and Malaysia.Global Times: In the eyes of you and other older generation Australian politicians, does China really pose a threat to Australia and the US?Menadue: I don't think China is a threat to us or to the US. It is nonsense and absurd to be talked about as if it is. In the case of the US, what worries it is that it has to make room for another power. The US is used to being the hegemon and finds it hard to accept China's success and its growing influence and place in the world. The US influence has fallen dramatically in so many ways, but it still clings to the belief that it's exceptional, that it can lead the world, that it has moral leadership. But it clearly doesn't have that moral leadership anymore when you look at Ukraine and the dreadful tragedy of Gaza at the moment. So America is losing its leadership appeal.  In the case of Australia, historically we were a settler society, settled initially from the United Kingdom. And we became very dependent upon the United Kingdom. We supported the United Kingdom in wars, in cultural and other ways. And now we're relying on another imperial power, the US. That historic settler consciousness made us frightened of our region, frightened of Asia, frightened of China.I'm not a representative of the older generation in Australia, because I had experiences as a university student sharing a room with Asian students. It changed my attitude back then in the 1950s. But many older Australians and also some young Australians still have the view that China is to be feared with its growing influence. Our media has been disgraceful in encouraging that belief. It reflects media ignorance about China. Undoubtedly, we will disagree with China from time to time. But there is no excuse for Australians not understanding China, its history and what motivates it at the present time. On the Australian side, we've got a lot of work to do.Australians accept the world that is dominated and managed by the US, rather than coming to terms with our own region. Our future is in our region and in relations with China. That's a major problem for a settler society like us, to reconcile our history and our geography. It's a struggle. Unfortunately, in the last 10 years or so, we've lost ground in reconciling those two.",OPINION,VIEWPOINT,"Aerial view of Commonwealth Bridge on Lake Burley Griffin, Canberra.

199,"Cracks in Red Sea alliance underline US-Europe division, embarrassment of US leadership",Global Times,2023-12-25,"""A just cause enjoys abundant support, while an unjust cause finds little support."" No one feels this snippet of wisdom more deeply than the US now. A spokesman for Spain's defense ministry told AFP on Sunday that the country will not participate in the so-called Operation Prosperity Guardian, a US-led maritime task force in the Red Sea that aims to protect the passage of Israel-owned and Israel-bound merchant vessels.Obviously, the US' EU allies are no longer willing to foot the bill of the US' selfishness. Operation Prosperity Guardian organized by the US has a strong political overtone, that is, safeguarding Israel's national interests. Israel's actions in Gaza have aroused the anger of the international community. More than 20,000 Palestine have reportedly been killed, more than 50,000 injured, and much of Gaza has been destroyed. Some EU countries have begun to diverge from the US on the Palestinian-Israeli Conflict. The objective of the US creating the Red Sea alliance, on the one hand, is testing whether its allies share the same beliefs with it on this issue. On the other hand, Washington is levering multilateral diplomatic actions to cover up its unilateral support of Israel.US allies always support the US and share its stance, but that does not mean they will unlimitedly support the frenzied positions taken by the US on all issues, especially when the US' position is contrary to their own interests. Take France for example. France's interests in the Middle East are multi-layered. The relationship between France and Lebanon has historical, cultural, and political dimensions. There are fundamental differences between France's relations with Saudi Arabia countries and the diplomatic posture of the US in the Middle East.For a long time, the US has had a bossy attitude toward its EU allies, taking it for granted that the value of its allies is to serve its interests. So when US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin included Spain in the US-commanded Operation Prosperity Guardian, he did it ""without prior notice,"" according to Spanish media outlet El Pais. The move displeased the Spanish government and triggered tension between Madrid and Washington. We could feel Washington's strong desire to control EU and EU's struggle to control its own destiny. To put it bluntly, the US treats EU as a lackey.Gao Jian, an expert on EU studies at Shanghai International Studies University, told the Global Times that the US was deeply involved in the reconstruction of EU after World War II, and also took advantage of the irreconcilable contradictions between EU and Russia to build the NATO-led EU security mechanism that still exists today. EU has paid a huge price for the transatlantic alliance. EU hopes to gain strategic independence, but is not capable of doing so. In the context of the Russia-Ukraine conflict in the past two years, the US has firmly tied EU to the US alliance mechanism. Yet, France said its operation in the Red Sea would stay under France command, while Italy said its operation was not part of Operation Prosperity Guardian, according to Reuters on Friday. EU may not want to turn nasty with the US, but its grievance toward the US will accumulate and the divergences between the US and EU will widen, Gao noted.The US' Operation Prosperity Guardian this time has exposed its embarrassment. Song Zhongping, a China military expert, believes that no matter it is the Iraq war, the Afghan war, or the current Russia-Ukraine or Palestinian-Israeli Conflict, the US' performance has made it lose its credibility and leadership. US allies see clearly that the US only causes trouble, but it is not willing to bear the consequences. Instead, it lets its allies clean up the mess. The appeal of the US has declined, as the US that is used to being echoed is now being rejected. This is a true manifestation of ""A just cause enjoys abundant support, while an unjust cause finds little support."" The choice of Spain shows the cracks within the transatlantic alliance. The US will have to pay the price for its egotism and arrogance.",OPINION,OBSERVER,Illustration: Liu Rui/GT,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'US': ('LOC', 16), 'Spain': ('LOC', 2), 'Red Sea': ('LOC', 2), 'Israel': ('LOC', 5), 'Gaza': ('LOC', 2), 'Palestine': ('LOC', 1), 'Washington': ('LOC', 3), 'France': ('LOC', 4), 'Middle East': ('LOC', 2), 'Lebanon': ('LOC', 1), 'Saudi Arabia': ('LOC', 1), 'Madrid': ('LOC', 1), 'AFP': ('ORG', 1), 'EU': ('ORG', 7), 'Defense Lloyd Austin': ('ORG', 1), 'El Paislea': ('ORG', 1), 'Gao Ji': ('ORG', 1), 'Shanghai': ('ORG', 1), 'University': ('ORG', 1), 'Operation Prosperity Guardian': ('MISC', 3), 'Palestinian - Israeli Conflict': ('MISC', 1), 'Spanish': ('MISC', 2)}"
200,Gaining insights into Chinese modernization’s global vision,Global Times,2023-12-25,"Editor's Note:The 2024 Global Times Annual Conference, themed ""Following the Path of China Modernization, Coping with Changes Unseen in a Century"" was held in Beijing on Saturday. To understand the implications of China modernization in this turbulent world and analyze what China can do to stay on this path and overcome various challenges in 2024, the Conference invited over 100 representatives from all walks of life as well as experts and scholars to share their views on four major themes. The following contains excerpts from the second theme - ""Development, security and civilization: the global vision of China modernization.""China modernization carries global significanceJin Canrong, professor of the School of International Studies at the Renmin University of China:Modernization began in the West; however, after centuries of industrialization, the success rate of modernization for non-West countries remains low. Given this background, China modernization carries global significance. When studying development economics, I had a feeling that the development theories of developed West countries, which became the first to climb the ladder of industrialization and achieve modernization, actually played a role in hindering other countries' development. From this perspective, it is even more important for us to promote and achieve China modernization. Only by successfully achieving this goal can we create a new path for modernization exploration for non-West countries and regions.Huang Jing, professor at Shanghai International Studies University:Development, security, and civilization - these perspectives themselves reflect the global vision of China modernization. From China's perspective, the international order is supported by three pillars: the international political order centered around the UN, the world economic and trade order centered around the World Trade Organization and other international economic and trade organizations, as well as the world financial order centered around the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. The foundation of these three orders is multilateral mechanisms rather than unilateral mechanisms. Therefore, China firmly adheres to multilateralism in diplomacy, which is promoting the improvement of the international order based on multilateral mechanisms.China modernization is embedded with a peaceful geneZhao Xiaozhuo, deputy director of the Beijing Xiangshan Forum Secretariat: One of the characteristics of China modernization is to walk on the path of peaceful development. China's culture emphasizes that peace is precious and that harmony brings wealth. Peace is also in line with the best interest of China, and one of the reasons for the great development achievements since the reform and opening-up is that we have seized the opportunity of such a long period of peace. Regarding the relationship between China modernization and peace, first, China is a defender and builder of peace in the region and the world. At present, wars are raging from EU to the Middle East and Africa, but the Asia-Pacific region has enjoyed decades of peaceful and prosperous development, in which China has undoubtedly played a significant role. Second, China is a provider of international public security products. China has always been an active participant in UN peacekeeping and escort operations and is the second-largest contributor to the UN's regular budget and peacekeeping assessments. In the event of natural disasters in its neighborhood, China has always tried its best to deliver aid and rescue. The activities of the China military, especially overseas, have never overridden the UN framework, but have always been based on UN mandates or resolutions.Third, China is gradually becoming a mediator in international security hotspots. This is a demand that has arisen naturally in the international community after China's power reached a certain level. The 9th Beijing Xiangshan Forum this year is a case in point, reflecting the international community's call for peace and its desire for China to play a greater role in international hotspots.Yang Yi, China People's Liberation Army (PLA) Navy rear admiral:China's development requires a peaceful, stable and secure world, and the world's development also needs a continuously modernizing China. China's Global Development Initiative (GDI), Global Security Initiative (GSI) and Global Civilization Initiative (GCI) can be understood as an international strategic path system of China modernization. China has always adhered to the path of peaceful development, but West countries, led by the US, traditionally achieved modernization through external expansion and colonial plunder. They believe that China will inevitably follow the beaten track of big powers in seeking hegemony. In this situation, China needs to formulate the correct strategy and take the correct measures while continuously enhancing its comprehensive strength, including military strength. In the current international environment, China faces many challenges, among which the most sensitive one is the Taiwan question. As China has repeatedly affirmed its firm position on the Taiwan question, coupled with the conflicts between Russia and Ukraine, and between Israel and Palestine, the US-led West camp is cautious about taking bold actions on the Taiwan question and has shifted its focus to the South China Sea. The South China Sea has become a new hotspot, especially when the West uses the Philippines as a pawn to continually provoke China. China advocates for peaceful development and fairness in the world, while the US insists on the ""law of the jungle"" and seeks to continue to ""dominate"" the world. We must both counter the US containment efforts against China and prevent conflicts, especially large-scale military confrontations. When dealing with the US, China must strive for the best results while also being prepared for the worst scenario. By being fully prepared we can better protect our national interests.Huang: The relationship between China and the US has a decisive impact on the world landscape. Whether in terms of politics, economy, military, culture, social system or on the ideological level, the US believes that China has the power to compete with it.The US has made significant efforts in economic competition with China. The ""de-globalization"" promoted by the US is actually ""de-Sinicization,"" and the ""small yard, high fence"" is essentially about ""decoupling"" from China. Driven by Cold War thinking, the US wants to engage in confrontation with China which is essentially a ""zero-sum game."" However, trade and economic cooperation have a nature of being a ""positive-sum game."" The US is now attempting to reverse the ""positive-sum game"" of trade and economic cooperation with China to a security-oriented ""zero-sum game.""In this regard, China has a broader perspective than the US. Politically, it does not export its own ideology or impose its own model on others. Economically, China, as the world's largest trading nation, actively promotes globalization because it recognizes that it can only develop in a world with closer cooperation. Militarily, China seeks cooperation and development based on common interests, equality and mutual benefits in an inclusive and open manner. In contrast, the ultimate goal of US alliances is confrontation based on ideology. Relationships within alliances are also unequal with the US always being the leader in the alliances it has established.Advancing stably and firmly the path to China modernization Zhu Feng, director of the Institute of International Studies at Nanjing University:We are at a critical point where China modernization is climbing over a hurdle, because in the near future, the global balance of power will remain in the current pattern of ""the West is strong and the East is weak"" despite a trend of ""rising East and declining West."" Thus, we need to promote China's scientific and technological innovation, the strength in high-end manufacturing and overall international competitiveness to reach a new historical peak. Promoting reform and opening-up to move forward continuously is a decisive step for China modernization to serve both the great rejuvenation of the China nation and contribute to world peace, development and prosperity.Shen Dingli, professor from Fudan University's Institute of International Studies:On the basis of the lessons learned from the past, especially in light of the new experiences since the reform and opening-up, we propose to build China modernization. China modernization is a part of global modernization and plays a role in improving global modernization in a certain sense. China's GDI, GSI and GCI also show that we can create a theoretical system applicable to the world by sorting out our own value and legal system as well as development experience. In order to promote the construction of China modernization, we still need to do our own things well and make greater efforts.Cui Hongjian, professor of the Academy of Regional and Global Governance with Beijing Foreign Studies University:Amid the emergence of multipolarity and the continued advancement of China modernization, we are entering a new era in which the world pattern and international order will have more conditions and are more likely to move toward greater equality and democracy. In this regard, we should have more confidence in the future benign evolution in the international landscape on the basis of economic globalization.",OPINION,VIEWPOINT,The 2024 Global Times Annual Conference is held in Beijing on Saturday.

201,Chances for truce slim as Israeli military actions further widen gap among parties,GT staff reporters,2023-12-25,"Christmas Day bloodshed in Gaza has resulted in the deaths of at least 70 people, marking one of the deadliest nights in the ongoing battle between Israel and Palestine. China experts believe the Netanyahu government's determination to extend its ""aggressive"" military actions in the Gaza will only widen the existing gap between the parties, and hopes for agreeing on a new plan proposed by Egypt are slim. Airstrikes that began before midnight continued into Christmas Day. Reports from residents and Palestine media indicate that Israel intensified its aerial and ground attacks in central Gaza, according to Reuters.Ashraf Al-Qidra, a spokesperson for the Health Ministry, stated that at least 70 people, including women and children, were killed in an Israel airstrike targeting Maghazi in central Gaza. On the same day, Egypt issued a three-stage truce proposal, which seeks to a short-term truce, release more hostages and eventually achieve the goal of a comprehensive cease-fire. Some sources suggest that Israel is not outright refusing the draft and that it may result in potential negotiations, according to The Times of Israel. Zhu Yongbiao, the director of the Center for Afghanistan Studies at Lanzhou University, said that Israel is pursuing a goal that it is well aware it cannot accomplish. The ongoing military actions in Gaza appear to be a desperate attempt by Israel to save face and avoid embarrassment.Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu restated his long-held belief on Sunday that the Gaza offensive will not cease until Hamas is eradicated. At the same time, Netanyahu also acknowledged the significant loss of life among his soldiers, with 153 casualties since the ground offensive began. The Christmas bloodshed shows Netanyahu is hell-bent on having his own way, Liu Zhongmin, a professor at the Middle East Studies Institute of Shanghai International Studies University, told the Global Times. The current peace deal proposed by Egypt offers hopes for a possible short-term cease-fire, but big challenges remain due to stark differences between Palestine and Israel, with latter's pursuit of its goal through aggression only further widening the existing gap between the two parties.Experts said Israel is facing multiple fronts at this juncture of the conflict. In one sense, it is trying to manage how to handle arrangements in Gaza in the so-called post-Hamas era. As its military actions have moved to the south of Gaza after the Israel army completed its carpet bombing on the northern part, the war should be coming to an end soon, although it will continue for some time in the future, Liu said. In another sense, ongoing military action in Gaza serves to extend the political career of Netanyahu, who has been facing huge pressure over political restructuring, the expert added. After several days of delays, the UN finally passed a resolution for increased aid to Gaza on Friday. The resolution, with 13 votes in favor, none against, and the US and Russia abstaining, merely called for steps ""to create the conditions for a sustainable cessation of hostilities."" But this resolution has sparked huge criticism, with some labeling it as ""woefully inadequate"" and ""almost meaningless,"" media outlet Al Jazeera reported on Saturday.Answering a question related to the resolution, China Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said Monday that due to well-known reasons, this resolution did not meet the expectations of the international community and there is still room for improvement. However, considering the current urgent situation and the positions of Saudi Arabia countries such as Palestine, China voted in favor.Mao said China hopes the UN resolution will be effectively implemented, humanitarian assistance will be expanded as soon as possible, and a monitoring mechanism will be established. The spokesperson also emphasized that achieving a cease-fire remains the overriding prerequisite.Liu also believes that a cease-fire is crucial for Gaza, given the huge causalities that the conflict has caused. But due to the fact that Israel has been receiving continuous support from the US, it intends to exploit the military actions in south Gaza to try to gain more advantages for itself in its diplomatic and political maneuvers, Liu noted. Zhu also said that as major countries continue to make efforts in this process, including regional countries, reaching an agreement on Egypt's new truce plan is not impossible, but chances of success are slim.",CHINA,MILITARY,"People clean up the rubble after an Israeli airstrike in the southern Gaza Strip city of Rafah, Dec. 24, 2023.

202,US still making no real efforts for cease-fire; ‘spillover effect of Gaza crisis to be seen in more regions’,Yang Sheng,2023-12-24,"US President Joe Biden has not asked Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for a cease-fire in Gaza, even though the crisis has spilled over to more and more regions as attacks targeting ships related to Israel have occurred not only in the Red Sea but also in the Indian Ocean.China analysts said that the navigation problem brings pressure to everyone along trade routes, but the conflict and humanitarian crisis in Gaza are the cause of these attacks. Saudi Arabia and Islamic countries in the region are divided about how to deal with the problem, so before the end of the conflict, it is unlikely that attacks against Israel-linked ships will come to a halt. According to the statement released by the White House on Saturday, leaders of the US and Israel discussed ""Israel's military campaign in Gaza"" to include its objectives and phasing. Joe Biden emphasized ""the critical need to protect the civilian population including those supporting the humanitarian aid operation,"" and ""the importance of allowing civilians to move safely away from areas of ongoing fighting."" Joe Biden told the media on Saturday that he ""did not ask Netanyahu to negotiate a cease-fire,"" despite rising pressure to do so. Pro-Palestine protesters launched a ""No Christmas as usual"" campaign, and took to the streets on ""Super Saturday"" en masse in multiple major West cities including New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, London and Toronto.The ""Shut it Down for Palestine"" movement, made up of pro-Palestine groups, had plans to ""organize actions to boycott, disrupt, and rally at commercial centers on December 23,"" according to the website of the ANSWER Coalition activist group, the Hill reported. Protesters in New York City appeared to be chanting, ""While you're shopping, bombs are dropping.""In the US, people who sympathize with Palestine are mainly voters who intended to support Joe Biden rather than Donald Trump, so in order to respond to these people, Joe Biden must do something. However, he has yet made efforts for a cease-fire, as Jewish groups are also important for Joe Biden as key funders of Democratic candidates, analysts noted, saying that the Joe Biden administration is facing an embarrassing situation. What Joe Biden is trying to do at the moment is just political gesturing, and it has nothing to do with the situation in Gaza.""This is a key moment for the crisis, in fact, Israel's major military activities have almost finished, while the Netanyahu administration needs to consider how to end this conflict in a dignified way and avoid political and governance burden in Gaza, Wang Jin, an associate professor at the Institute of Middle Eastern Studies at Northwest University, told the Global Times on Sunday, noting the US is actually trying to help Israel find a good timing and pretext to end this conflict with 'dignity' to some extent."" Spillover effectOn Saturday, the attacks that target Israel-linked ships occur in Indian Ocean, which is the latest sign of risks expanding to commercial shipping beyond the Red Sea. Reuters reported that a ""Liberia-flagged, Japanese-owned, and Netherlands-operated chemical tanker"" struck Saturday off the coast of India was targeted by a drone ""fired from Iran,"" the Pentagon said in a statement.The attacks launched by some non-state actors in the region to some extent fit the demand among the Islamic world to support Palestine in Gaza while the governments of those Saudi Arabia and Islamic countries are unable to take any direct action to pressure Israel effectively. This is why most Saudi Arabia and Islamic countries refused to join the US-led joint patrols and also refused to directly condemn the Houthi militia in Yemen. Some might even tolerate these attacks, said Song Zhongping, a China military expert and TV commentator.""Washington might want to use this incident to hype another civil war in Yemen so that it can force Saudi Arabia to return to the battle fields in Yemen, and then undermine the recovering ties between Riyadh and Tehran. But this attempt is unlikely to succeed,"" Song told the Global Times on Sunday.Liu Zhongmin, a professor at the Middle East Studies Institute of Shanghai International Studies University, echoed that ""joining the US-led and Israel-supported multinational patrol at this moment to target the Houthis would go against the shared justice and morality among the Muslim world. The biggest political correctness shared by the Muslim world at this moment is about opposing Israel and supporting Palestine.""However, the attacks will also affect the interests of many countries in the region and even the major economies around the globe. Reuters reported on December 18 that the attacks launched by Yemen's Houthi group on commercial ships at the southern end of the Red Sea have prompted several shipping companies to divert vessels, avoiding a route that would take them through Egypt's Suez Canal in the north and its link to the Mediterranean.""Therefore, not only will Israel pay the price, but the attacks will also damage the interests of major regional countries like Egypt. The approach they will likely choose to solve the problem will be pressuring the US and Israel to end the conflict and open corridors for humanitarian aid to enter Gaza, rather than joining the US-led coalition to fight the Houthis,"" Liu said.The joint patrol led by the US is a typical case of ""curing the symptoms, not the disease,"" and the US needs to realize that the root cause is in Gaza, not Yemen. Once it makes real efforts to stop the conflict effectively, the problems in the Red Sea will dissipate. If not, the attacks will occur in more regions. The US won't be able to cover all of them, and more and more countries will be affected, and then the pressure on the Joe Biden administration will greatly intensify, Liu noted.",CHINA,DIPLOMACY,"Missiles are seen during a military parade held by the Houthi group in Sanaa, Yemen.(Photo: Xinhua)","Reporter, Beijing","Yang Sheng is a chief reporter at the Global Times covering Chinese politics, diplomacy and military.","{'US': ('LOC', 3), 'Israel': ('LOC', 6), 'Gaza': ('LOC', 4), 'Red Sea': ('LOC', 1), 'Indian Ocean': ('LOC', 1), 'China': ('LOC', 1), 'Saudi Arabia': ('LOC', 1), 'White House': ('LOC', 1), 'West': ('LOC', 1), 'New York': ('LOC', 1), 'Chicago': ('LOC', 1), 'Los Angeles': ('LOC', 1), 'London': ('LOC', 1), 'Toronto': ('LOC', 1), 'New York City': ('LOC', 1), 'Joe Biden': ('PER', 5), 'Benjamin Netanyahu': ('PER', 3), 'Joe B': ('PER', 3), 'Donald Trump': ('PER', 1), 'Islamic': ('MISC', 1), 'Pro': ('MISC', 1), 'Palestine': ('MISC', 4), 'Christmas': ('MISC', 1), 'Super': ('MISC', 1), 'Shut': ('MISC', 1), 'Down': ('MISC', 1), 'pro': ('MISC', 1), 'Jewish': ('MISC', 1), 'Democratic': ('MISC', 1), 'ANSWER Coalition': ('ORG', 1), 'Hill': ('ORG', 1)}"
203,"In dealing with the US, China should strive for the best outcome, but also prepare for the worst consequences: PLA Navy rear admiral",Global Times,2023-12-23,"China advocates peaceful development, while the West powers, led by the US, believe China will inevitably follow the path of previous major powers in seeking hegemony. This fundamental difference in perspective creates a significant contradiction between the two sides, China People's Liberation Army (PLA) Navy rear admiral Yang Yi said at the Global Times Annual Conference 2024. He warned that China should strive for the best outcome, but also prepare for the worst consequences by developing plans and building up its own strength.Among the various challenges and problems we face right now, the China-US relationship is the largest one. The recent meeting between the two heads of state in San Francisco has provided confidence in the strategic stability of bilateral relations, Yang said. However, he noted that this confidence alone cannot solve the decisive contradictions between the two countries.Yang said that judging from the current global situation and the challenges China faces, there are several areas of particular concern, including the Taiwan question. ""Given China's resolute attitude on the Taiwan question and repeated emphasis that the Taiwan question is our red line, bottom line, and core interest, we have made it clear that there will be consequences if anyone tries to challenge us.""The PLA's resolution and strength should not be underestimated. Therefore, in the context of this situation, coupled with the conflicts between Russia and Ukraine, and between Israel and Palestine, the US-led West camp is cautious about taking bold actions on the Taiwan question, and have shifted their focus to the South China Sea, Yang remarked.The South China Sea has become a new hotspot, especially when the West uses the Philippines as a pawn to continually provoke China. In the face of this problem, we must adopt the right strategy and increase our strength, Yang said.In terms of strength, various aspects surrounding the China-US relationship have undergone changes. In the past few years, the economic and trade relationship was the ballast stone, but now it has become collateral, said Yang.He said that when he led the military security strategic dialogue group to visit the US in 2003, he emphasized that the military relationship between China and the US was the barometer of the bilateral relationship. Ironically, now the military relationship between China and the US has changed to an insurance tether that ensures large-scale military conflicts are avoided, Yang said. Yang praised the recent video meeting between Liu Zhenli, a Central Military Commission (CMC) member and the chief of the CMC's Joint Staff Department, and General Charles Q. Brown, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff of the US as a good example.China strives for stability, but is not afraid of troubles. China must be prepared, and power preparation is very important. One can only better protect national interests once equipped with a strong and powerful force, Yang noted. China modernization is the essence of the Report to the 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China. China offers an alternative path for people in non-West countries. However, it is important to note that the path to advance China modernization is not smooth, and there are internal issues such as the country's population and economy, as well as other challenges. The main external challenge comes from the US, and the China-US rivalry is the main contradiction influencing the current situation, Jin Canrong, associate dean of the School of International Studies at the Renmin University of China, said at the conference. Jin said in the face of pressure from the US, as long as China maintains domestic development and stability, it can handle the situation well.",CHINA,POLITICS,"Yang Yi, Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) Navy rear admiral.

204,"'Sanctions from hell' against China, ignorance or malice?: Global Times editorial",Global Times,2023-12-22,"US Senator Lindsey Graham, who has always been extremely anti-China, has once again made shocking remarks, declaring that he would work with lawmakers from both parties to ""draft pre-invasion sanctions from hell to impose on China if they take action to seize Taiwan."" He also claimed to ""create a robust defense supplemental for Taiwan."" As for what constitutes ""sanctions from hell,"" Graham did not specify, but he seems to intend to use this exaggerated rhetoric to intimidate China, perhaps believing it will compel China to abandon reunification efforts. The arrogance and ignorance of this ""veteran"" senator are truly eye-catching.If we take a closer look at what has deeply disturbed Graham, making him feel ""extremely uneasy,"" it becomes even more evident. The trigger for this unease was a sensationalized ""disclosure"" by the US media outlets, claiming that China informed the US last month about its intention of reunification, though the specific timing has not yet been decided. The mere mention of the phrase ""reunification"" seems to have jolted many Washington elites, including Graham, leaving them unable to accept it and treating it as a momentous new development. This reaction reveals an inherent reflex among them, indicating that they fundamentally do not wish for China's reunification.China must be and will be reunified. Is this some kind of secret? Does it require US media outlets to ""expose"" this? Is it necessary for some politicians in Washington to appear so surprised and flustered? China has consistently pursued the prospect of peaceful reunification with the utmost sincerity and effort. Simultaneously, we make no commitment to renounce the use of force, but regardless of the means, the ultimate goal is the complete reunification of the country. This has been China's established policy for decades, a transparent and straightforward strategic approach, and above all, it resonates with the collective national sentiments of over 1.4 billion China people. How is it that politicians like Graham in the US feel ""uneasy"" about it? They simply do not have the qualifications to feel ""uneasy"" about China's national matters.Do US politicians really care about the future and destiny of Taiwan and the people on the island? Absolutely not. Just three days before Graham advocated for ""sanctions from hell,"" he criticized the proposed aid package supported by the Democratic Party, stating that he ""will not help Ukraine, Taiwan or Israel until we secure a border that's been obliterated."" In plain terms, he is using these issues as leverage against the Democratic Party. For these politicians, their political self-interest takes precedence over everything else, and the actual existence or location of Taiwan is essentially irrelevant to them.The only thing reflected by this incident is probably the profound ignorance of many US politicians regarding Taiwan's affairs. It seems as if they have just become aware of China's consistent policies and determination over the past few decades through ""media revelations,"" treating it as if they've discovered a new continent. This raises serious doubts about how many members of the US Congress can accurately point out Taiwan's geographical location on a map. Over the years, US politicians have indulged in numerous absurd statements and speculations about China, whether it's claiming that China has a ""2,000-year plan to destroy America,"" or posing ludicrous inquiries such as whether TikTok automatically connects to Wi-Fi. Their professional competence falls far short of expected standards. Given this group of people, no viewpoint they express should come as a surprise.However, for someone like Graham, a ""veteran anti-China figure"" who has been in Congress for decades, is he genuinely ignorant? It's doubtful. If it's not ignorance, then it's extreme malice. They are more likely to use every instance of public attention to demonize China, making every effort to confuse the US public's perception, thereby attempting to mislead the entire country's foreign policy. Taiwan is not Hawaii or Alaska; it is a part of China, not the US. Some US lawmakers now talk about ""China's reunification"" as if China is about to invade the US. However, the real danger for the US lies not in China's reunification efforts but in these arrogant and uninformed lawmakers.The term ""sanctions from hell"" may sound intimidating, but do Graham and others genuinely believe it will scare China? Do they really think China will be deterred in the Taiwan question due to the fear of ""sanctions from hell""? The China people will dismiss such notions with a contemptuous smile. The narrative of US lawmakers about this 21st-century fantasy seems more like a political marketing slogan aimed at impressing US voters. US President Joe Biden has explicitly stated on numerous occasions that he does not support ""Taiwan independence,"" and the US has reiterated that its ""one-China policy"" remains unchanged. Therefore, offering explanations to China for threats like those from Graham, expressing apologies for harming the collective sentiments of the China people, and ensuring commitments are fulfilled is what the US should do.",OPINION,EDITORIAL,"Lindsey Graham speaks to reporters at the Capitol in Washington, the US, on December 7, 2023.

According to some foreign media reports, despite the resolution's diluted language and replacement of ""cessation of hostilities"" for ""cease-fire"" in order to reach a compromise, the US, which has always supported Israel at the UN, has been reluctant to give it a pass.As the world watches whether the US will vote in support of or at least abstain from allowing the UN to adopt its first binding resolution on the Palestine issue since this round of conflict began, analysts said that the moral weight continues to mount on the US. The Gaza Government Media Office said on Wednesday that since Israel began bombing the Gaza more than ten weeks ago, at least 20,000 Palestine have been killed there, of whom at least 8,000 were children and 6,200 were women, media reported. The US is in a precarious situation, as it is trying to back Israel but fears more isolation from the international community, which was made clear by the tense diplomatic negotiations taking place at the UN right now, Sun Degang, director of the Center for Middle Eastern Studies at Fudan University, told the Global Times. The wrangling over the wording of the resolution shows the US' struggling to defend the ""legitimacy"" of Israel's actions in Gaza, said Sun, noting that the US and Israel consider Hamas to be a terrorist organization and do not see it as an equal counterpart, said Sun. International discontent with US partiality has grown as a result of the country's past favoritism for Israel and its history of vetoing UN resolutions pertaining to the Palestinian-Israeli Conflict. US dissatisfaction with Israel is also growing, increasing the possibility for the US to pass the resolution, Tian Wenlin, a research fellow at the China Institutes of Contemporary International Relations, told the Global Times.Israel's military claimed it had uncovered a major Hamas command center in the heart of Gaza, while Israel's economy has been severely impacted by the military operation. The Red Sea raids by Yemen's Houthi rebels have also had an impact on international shipping and Israel's economy, adding to the momentum for another truce in the Palestinian-Israeli Conflict, said Tian. Reuters reported on Thursday that Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh traveled to Egypt on Wednesday to negotiate a fresh agreement for Hamas to exchange Israel hostages for Palestine prisoners held by Israel and a temporary cease-fire.The US' inability to promote a cease-fire or defuse the situation since this round of Palestinian-Israeli Conflict fighting began indicates that its leverage in the Middle East is eroding, along with its hard and soft power, said Sun.",CHINA,POLITICS,"People conduct rescue work after an Israeli airstrike in the southern Gaza Strip city of Rafah, on Dec. 20, 2023.

209,US-led coalition in the Red Sea only 'band-aid solution'; an immediate cease-fire in urgent need to avoid spillovers,GT staff reporters,2023-12-20," As the world's shipping and trade might be further disrupted by attacks on ships along the main Red Sea shipping route, worries among multinational companies - including China ones that are entering the busiest export season - have grown. Analysts said on Wednesday that the multinational coalition headed by the US to protect trade ships in the Red Sea is only a ""band-aid solution,"" and that the situation can worsen unless there is a cease-fire agreement or a cooling-off period in the Gaza.On Tuesday, Yemen's Houthi rebels said the new US-led military coalition in the Red Sea would not stop their attacks on Israel-bound commercial ships. Houthi spokesperson Mohammed Abdulsalam said in a statement carried by the Houthi-controlled Saba news agency that their naval operations aim at supporting the Palestine people and are not ""a show of force or a challenge to anyone."" Many oil tankers and cargo ships that had been sailing through the Suez Canal have changed course to avoid the danger in the Red Sea, and some ships that were already in motion have armed guards on board, according to a Reuters report on Wednesday. The 10-nation coalition led by the US to escort ships transiting the Red Sea is to deter the Houthi militia, but it is only a short-term measure that cannot solve the issue at the root, Ding Long, a professor with the Middle East Studies Institute of Shanghai International Studies University, told the Global Times.Currently, the US cannot find a better way to deal with the Houthi rebels as any direct military operation toward it would make the current situation in the Middle East more complicated. But a temporary solution like this may also lead to a conflict escalation if the Houthi militia accidentally attacks a coalition force vessel, Ding said. Ding said that the root cause of a series of problems in the Middle East, including security issues in the Red Sea, lies in the Palestinian-Israeli Conflict. If there is no cease-fire, and if the Palestinian-Israeli Conflict issue cannot be completely resolved, these spillover effects will continue to expand. The escalating attacks of Houthi rebels on commercial ships in the Red Sea and the Bab al-Mandab Strait for the past days have affected global shipping via Suez Canal as it is the quickest maritime route between EU and Asia. According to a report from China's Central Television on Tuesday, about 30 to 40 percent of the goods from a Yiwu-based company in China need to be transported via the Red Sea route and after detouring, an average journey on the EU route will increase by about 10 days. Freight rates have also increased. For example, for a 40-foot-high container to the Middle East and EU, the freight rate has increased by about $600 with the rate ranging from $2,400 to $2,500. If the situation in the Red Sea does not change for better soon, prices in January will continue to rise, according to the report. US State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said at a press conference on Tuesday that the US would welcome China playing ""a constructive role"" in trying to prevent attacks from taking place.But China analysts said China is not the only nation affected by the Red Sea shipping issue. Other nations and the global community are all involved and are influenced by this problem and the Palestinian-Israeli Conflict issue. They urged the US not to attempt to shift focus by pressuring China.Analysts noted that instead of pressuring others, the US should exert more pressure in Israel to push for a cease-fire in Gaza, as this is the only way to ensure the security and stability of the Red Sea.",CHINA,SOCIETY,"US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin speaks at US Navy Central Command headquarters in Manama, Bahrain, on Tuesday.

210,The fundamental way to ensure peace and stability in the Red Sea is to achieve a permanent cease-fire in Gaza,Hu Xijin,2023-12-20," The Red Sea has become a new focus that is tugging at the world's heartstrings. Yemen's Houthis have announced attacks on all commercial ships directly linked to Israel, and the US has called on China to use its influence to pressure the Iran-backed Houthis. Is China capable of influencing the Houthis in this way? I am deeply skeptical. The Houthis have said they will only stop the attacks if Israel stops its military operations in Gaza. China cannot persuade Israel to stop, so what can it do to persuade the Houthis? However, China can do something to ask the Houthis to open their eyes before the problem is solved - they should not mistakenly attack the China commercial ships.The Red Sea has emerged as a new turbulent area for the spillover of the Palestine-Israel conflict, and it is believed that the Houthis in Yemen possess a significant number of missiles and drones. While their capabilities may not be enough to engage in a conventional war, they are sufficient to target commercial ships. With the Houthis issuing threats and refusing to negotiate with the US, four shipping giants in EU announced the suspension of Red Sea routes through the Suez Canal and the Red Sea, opting instead to redirect their ships to the Cape of Good Hope. This means a massive increase in transportation voyages and costs.The US announced on Monday the formation of a multinational force to escort ships in the Red Sea, and immediately NATO countries such as Britain, Canada, France and the Netherlands announced their participation. But in the Middle East, only Bahrain has publicly announced its participation, and Egypt, Saudi Arabia and other countries have not.The silence of Egypt, Saudi Arabia and other Middle Eastern countries reflects the deep differences between the Saudi Arabia countries' attitude toward the Palestine-Israel conflict and that of the US. On one hand, by siding with Israel, the US stands in opposition to the majority of Saudi Arabia countries. On the other, it requires Saudi Arabia countries to accept its leadership in the Red Sea operation and provide warships and political resources. However, the primary goal of this is to protect the safety of shipping through Israel's ports, which will only embarrass the governments of those Saudi Arabia countries in the face of their people and public opinion if they agree to follow the US. In addition, countries such as Egypt and Saudi Arabia are wary of Iran's attitude and do not want to affect their improving relations with Iran. The US claims that several other countries have also agreed to be involved in the operation but prefer not to be publicly named, presumably referring to the Saudi Arabia countries.The security of the Red Sea is indeed important, and it is reported that more than 20,000 ships pass through the Suez Canal and the Red Sea Passage each year. During my visit to the Suez Canal, I witnessed long lines of ships waiting to pass through. China ports are commonly used as both departure and destination points for these ships, so China has a particular stake in the security of the Red Sea. China has an overseas support base in Djibouti on the West coast of the Gulf of Aden, which serves as the outlet of the Red Sea. There is a clear need for China warships to step up escort operations in the Red Sea.The Houthis have repeatedly reiterate the safety of maritime routes in the Red Sea and Arabian Sea, ensuring no threat to ships from any nation, except those linked to the enemy entity or destined for its ports. The Houthis should have a willingness to take their commitments seriously, because destroying this passage in the Red Sea will directly violate the interests of all coastal countries and make themselves a target of public criticism. The key lies in whether the Houthi armed forces can accurately focus on their target so that the majority of passing ships are truly safe.The interests of many countries are involved, but the interests of most countries vary. In other words, everyone wants the Red Sea to be secure, but they are dissatisfied with the US using Red Sea security as a means to ensure Israel completes its operations in Gaza. They are also worried about whether the Houthis will disrupt the entire Red Sea.If the frequency of attacks by the Houthi armed forces increases, the multinational patrols led by the US will not achieve its original goals. Once the situation worsens, some predict that the US and Israel may launch large-scale attacks against the Houthis' land bases, which will lead to the expansion of the war. Once that happens, the Red Sea channel will be ruined.China undoubtedly welcomes peace and security in the Red Sea, but how we take on the role we play there will also be a complex issue. We must first protect the safety of China ships and those directly related to China. On the issue of shaping regional peace mechanisms, we should coordinate our actions and adopt a consistent position with most Saudi Arabia countries in the region. To ensure that China ships are safe in the Red Sea, we should minimize the pressure on our ships to reroute around the Cape of Good Hope. Our moves and the joint patrol operations of the US will probably not get mixed up, but there is no need to create a conflicting relationship. After all, it is not a bad thing for everyone that the Red Sea is safe. In addition, we want to emphasize the concept that the fundamental way to ensure peace and stability in the Red Sea is to achieve a permanent cease-fire in Gaza and truly promote the political settlement of the Palestine-Israel issue.The author is a China media professional. opinion@globaltimes.com.cn",OPINION,VIEWPOINT,"US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin speaks at US Navy Central Command headquarters in Manama, Bahrain, on Tuesday.

211,China-Europe cargo trains may offer alternative if Red Sea tensions worsen,GT staff reporters,2023-12-20," As maritime routes to EU and the Mediterranean region have been affected amid tensions in the Red Sea, China business insiders said that China-EU cargo trains may offer an alternative if the conflict intensifies. A transport agent surnamed Meng in Erenhot, North China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, told the Global Times on Wednesday that the China-EU freight trains will be a substitute for intercontinental transport if maritime routes are blocked.Erenhot port is a critical exit point for outbound China-EU freight trains. From January 1 to December 10 this year, Erenhot has handled 3,118 inbound and outbound China-EU freight trains, up 32.2 percent year-on-year, according to the Xinhua. ""The general shipment fee was increased due to the conflicts in the Red Sea, so we had to switch from ships to the China-EU freight trains to deliver goods to Poland,"" Ding Yandong, general manager of Ningbo-based Rollmax shutter component Co, told the Global Times on Wednesday. Ding noted that sea shipping is still available, but it means rounding the Cape of Good Hope, which adds about 7,000 kilometers to the trip -taking more time and costing more money.Yemen's Houthi rebels on December 16 said they have launched cross-border drone attacks on several targets in Israel's southern city of Eilat. The rebel group has vowed to prevent all Israel-bound commercial ships from passing through the Red Sea until the ongoing Israel war on the Palestine enclave of the Gaza ends, the Xinhua reported.Multiple global shipping companies including Maersk, MSC and Evergreen Marine Co plan to steer clear of the Suez Canal to avoid conflicts. Experts said the situation is likely to further drive up shipping rates.""It usually takes about 26 days for sea shipments from China to Poland, and rounding the Cape of Good Hope adds 10 more days, The China-EU freight trains take about 16 days in total, which is more efficient but also more expensive,"" said Ding. Meng noted that the China-EU freight trains don't have sufficient capacity to completely replace maritime transport, but they do offer an alternative.",SOURCE,ECONOMY,"A cargo ship called Cosco Ashdod docks at an automated port in Qingdao, East China's Shandong Province on November 1, 2023.

214,US politicians need a lesson in democracy as majority of Americans want a cease-fire in Gaza,Global Times,2023-12-19,"Editor's Note:   The US ""lies all the time… It's time for that to stop,"" Judie Evans (Evans), co-founder of the US anti-war organization Code Pink told Global Times (Global Times) reporter Ma Ruiqian in a recent interview. In her view, the US is standing on the wrong side of history in Israel-Palestine conflict, and is also attempting to portray China as an ""enemy"" using lies and tactics to make people in the US afraid. Evans has initiated the ""China is not our enemy"" campaign, asserting that both the China and US people are beautiful, and the US and China have to get along.Global Times: Could you briefly introduce the activities that Code Pink is currently organizing, and your organization's stance and claim?Evans: We've been in the halls of Congress, speaking to members of Congress to call for a cease-fire. We've been in the halls of the Senate calling for members of Senate to call for a cease-fire. We've been opposing Blinken who was asking for another $14.3 billion for weapons for Israel, even though he claims to care about the Palestine people. It's incredibly absurd that those in power believe we'll buy into the idea that they care about the Palestine while actively bombing them.  Global Times: While many US are calling for a cease-fire, the US continues to provide weapons and financial support to Israel. In your opinion, what role is the US playing in the war? Why is the US Congress disregarding public opinion and staunchly supporting Israel?Evans: As US President Joe Biden has stated, if there were not an Israel, the US would have to invent one. It was established as an imperialist tool in the Middle East. One of the most important things is the fact that, in the US and around the world, Jews are saying no. Jews are standing up while the US claims that anti-Semitism opposes Israel's actions. We must understand that this is not a Jewish project. No Jewish person I know would agree to this level of violence.The US spends $1.5 trillion on war and violence every year. Can you imagine working hard, paying your taxes, and instead of that money going to serve your community, healthcare, education and people's needs, it's destroying other countries and taking lives?We don't have a representative government in the US. We have a bought and sold government that is bought and sold by the rich. And in war, the rich get richer. Since October 7, the stocks in the weapons industry have gone up, some of them by 10 percent. That's gross, that's horrific, and it's making a killing on killing. The people in power believe they'll stay in power by killing people, and that's truly sad. What we do know from the polls is that Joe Biden is losing support. Current polls show he cannot win the next election because he's lost the support of young people and Saudi Arabia US.Global Times: In October, the photos of red hands at a Senate hearing really impressed people. Activist Medea Benjamin Netanyahu was reportedly arrested for demanding a cease-fire. Many other activists have been arrested in recent protests. How is the status of Benjamin Netanyahu or other activists you know now? Evans: They're all fine. She was released within a few hours. In the US, when you're arrested in Congress, it's a very quick turnaround. They just want to get you out of the way. It's essential to remember that the US is founded on the principles of free speech, while they can put you in jail for that too. An interesting aspect regarding Israel is that, in the US, you have the freedom to criticize your government, but 37 US states have adopted laws, executive orders, or resolutions designed to discourage boycotts against Israel, reports show. Global Times: You reposted on X that ""What would it look like if you were standing on the wrong side of history?"" As for the Israel-Palestine issue, where do you think the US government stands in history? As an US, what are your feelings about this?Evans: The US is standing on the wrong side of history. You don't need history to tell you this. The votes in the UN alone can tell you this. A country claiming to believe in democracy ignores a UN vote that says no. That is not democracy. They need a lesson in democracy when domestic polls show more than two-thirds of US want a cease-fire, yet only 18 members of Congress vote for it, and the president does nothing. I would say that most people I know believe the empire is dying, it is weak. It would be lovely if they could let go and let someone else have a turn to try to do it better.The US empire has been so violent. It doesn't really believe in democracy. It lies all the time and gets away with murder. It's time for that to stop. How many governments has it overthrown? How many countries has it bombed? Can we just end this already? The US is on the wrong side of history. Anyone who believes in peace, justice and love for humanity and the planet can see this.Global Times: This tweet also mentions an interesting comparison between the ""real world"" and the ""narrative world."" Apart from the Israel-Palestine issue, is the US creating a similar narrative in its discourse about China?Evans: Exactly the same. Create an enemy and make people afraid in the US. They're trying to sell China as the enemy and someone everyone should be afraid of. They are spreading lies about China, so they can harness the hearts and minds of the US to go to war on China. And it's a narrative. That's why I launched my campaign - China is not our enemy. In the real world, the rules of the UN and the ICC state that you can't go to war on another country. But the US got away with it on Iraq. It wasn't held accountable or responsible. So it thinks they can just do it with its 750 bases around the world. It's the criminal on the globe. It says it's the leader of the rules-based order, but it's the big criminal. It doesn't follow any rules.The US and China have to get along. I'm really grateful for California Governor Gavin Newsom's visit to China because it was refreshing to see a US leader have the respect and the humanity to have a beautiful conversation here in China to show the beauty of China.People are beautiful, China people are beautiful, US people are beautiful. We've got to stop power from driving wars. The people need peace. And in the US, these lies and this hate that has been driven toward China. It already has casualties. The hate crimes targeting the Asian US community have reached some unprecedented levels. In the last 12 months, 75 percent of China US have experienced hate or violence. That's a horrific number. I know China US that are moving back to China. I know a judge who served her country for 30 years on the bench who can't leave her apartment. In Chinatown, in San Francisco, people are fleeing because they get abused. The US is using the same lies, the same tactics to create hate instead of cooperation. This is why we started the campaign. China is not our enemy. We could be telling beautiful stories connecting people to each other. It's always what the people in Code Pink do. We bring people together from Iraq, people from Iran, people from Syria, people from Yemen and people from Afghanistan, that the US is bombing, to try to get people to see you're talking about a human being. It's a person with a family. They're beautiful, people are beautiful, all humans are beautiful. How can anyone even think of bombing people? This is crazy!Global Times: In the future, do you and your organization Code Pink plan to continue protesting against violence and advocating for peace?Evans: We will continue to be in the streets, disrupting Congress. We'll persist in raising money for aid and highlighting the need for assistance, amplifying the voices of those who need to be heard, especially from Palestine.As a community, we're deeply committed to helping people nourish their own hearts. The violence to the psyche and the heart inflicted by narratives affects every human being. We'll continue taking care of each other and supporting all those within our capacity to assist in our community.We understand that the only recognizable feature of hope is action. Daily engagement is crucial, as it helps the heart to heal. We'll create something to do every day, making things, singing in the streets, engaging in art and theatre. We'll share poetry received from Palestine to hear the voices of the poets there, sharing their arts and stories because we refuse to let those voices be unheard. We'll persist until this ends. In our hearts, we hold the belief that humanity will triumph over this violence. Life will prevail, and we won't stop or stay silent. We recognize that catastrophes happen when people are silent, and we will not be silent.",OPINION,VIEWPOINT,Courtesy of Code Pink,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'US': ('LOC', 16), 'Israel': ('LOC', 6), 'Palestine': ('LOC', 3), 'China': ('LOC', 4), 'Middle East': ('LOC', 1), 'Judie Evans': ('PER', 5), 'Ma Ruiqian': ('PER', 1), 'Blinken': ('PER', 1), 'Joe Biden': ('PER', 1), 'Code Pink': ('ORG', 2), 'Global Times': ('ORG', 4), 'Congress': ('ORG', 3), 'Senate': ('ORG', 2), 'Jews': ('MISC', 2), 'Semi': ('MISC', 1), 'Jewish': ('MISC', 2)}"
215,Title not found,Yang Sheng,2023-12-19,"The US-led joint patrol in the Red Sea following Houthi militia attacks against ships heading toward Israel shows that the Palestinian-Israeli Conflict in Gaza is not only affecting the whole region, but also the international community. China analysts pointed out that the root cause of the trade route problem is the ongoing conflict in Gaza, and only a sustainable cease-fire and allowing humanitarian aid to enter Gaza via land and sea routes can solve the problem in the Red Sea. China will pay close attention to the situation, and China naval vessels that conduct UN authorized anti-piracy missions in the region will keep performing their duty, analysts said, adding that China will stick to the priority of realizing a cease-fire and clear the way for humanitarian aid for the people in Gaza, rather than joining the US to conduct any military operations without UN authorization to escalate the crisis in Gaza. The US and a host of other nations are creating a new force to protect ships transiting the Red Sea that have come under attack by drones and ballistic missiles fired from Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin announced Tuesday in Bahrain, the AP reported.The UK, Bahrain, Canada, France, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Seychelles and Spain have joined, Austin said. Some of those countries will conduct joint patrols while others will provide intelligence support in the southern Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden.The Houthi militia attacked two commercial ships in the Red Sea with naval drones on Monday. The recent attacks have caused concerns about the impact on the passage of oil, grain and other goods on what is an important global trade route, and have pushed up the cost of insuring and shipping goods through the Red Sea, Reuters reported.The Shanghai-based news website The Paper reported on Tuesday that following other international shipping companies including Denmark's Maersk and France's CMA, China shipping giants like COSCO and Orient Overseas Container Line (OOCL) also suspended transport through the Red Sea.Ma Xiaolin, dean of the Institute for Studies on the Mediterranean Rim at Zhejiang International Studies University, told the Global Times on Tuesday that the trade route via the Red Sea is truly important for China as it connects EU, Asia and Africa, so China will pay close attention to the situation.""However, although China has naval vessels in the region, their mission is about anti-piracy, rather than intervening in regional issues and other countries' internal affairs. Only a solution to the ongoing crisis in Gaza can effectively solve the problem in the Red Sea,"" Ma said. On December 9, Al Jazeera reported that the armed group in Yemen claimed that ""it will target all ships heading to Israel, regardless of their nationality, and warned all international shipping companies against dealing with Israel ports.""""If Gaza does not receive the food and medicines it needs, all ships in the Red Sea bound for Israel ports, regardless of their nationality, will become a target for our armed forces,"" the group's spokesperson said in a statement on Saturday, according to Al Jazeera.Song Zhongping, a China military expert and TV commentator, told the Global Times on Tuesday that the ""Houthis are specifically targeting Israel, so it's unlikely it will attack China vessels. China doesn't need to be too worried about the situation and the China warships in the region will stick to their plan.""""China will keep making efforts to realize a sustainable cease-fire and clear the way for humanitarian aid to get into the Gaza. This is the real priority that needs to be done,"" Wang Jin, an associate professor at the Institute of Middle Eastern Studies at Northwest University, told the Global Times on Tuesday.If Washington and its allies want to solve the Red Sea problem, they should play a responsible role in the UN to pass a cease-fire resolution and to put concrete efforts into improving the humanitarian situation in Gaza, which would be more effective than sending warships to conduct joint patrols, experts said. The humanitarian situation in Gaza remains severe. According to Reuters on Tuesday, Israel missiles and air strikes on the Rafah area in Gaza struck three houses killing at least 20 Palestine, Gaza health officials said on Tuesday. Tens of thousands of displaced Palestine have crammed into Rafah on Gaza's border with Egypt to escape Israel bombardments.The lack of unity in the UN that is mainly caused by the US is another key reason why the situation is far from easing. The UN delayed until Tuesday morning a vote on an Saudi Arabia-sponsored resolution calling for a halt to hostilities in Gaza to allow for urgently needed aid deliveries to a massive number of civilians as members intensified negotiations to try to avoid another veto by the US, the AP reported.Wang Wenbin, a spokesperson for the China Foreign Ministry, said at a routine press conference on Tuesday that ""the UN has adopted two resolutions with an overwhelming majority. We hope the US will listen to the voice of the international community, stop single-handedly blocking UN resolutions, and play its due role to promote an immediate cease-fire and prevent an even larger humanitarian catastrophe.""",CHINA,SOCIETY,"US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin addresses members of an international maritime task force protecting commercial ships in the Red Sea at US Navy Central Command headquarters in Manama, Bahrain, on December 19, 2023.

216,Sensible for Australia to refuse US Red Sea warship request,Jerry Grey,2023-12-19,"The US requesting Australia to send a ship into the Red Sea may seem strange, but it could be an indicator of something far more sinister. To be clear, this is not an official request, and Australia is not the only country to have been asked. It was reported that seven members of the 39 nations that rotate command of the region, have apparently stepped forward to offer support, but the US has not announced who they are. At the time of writing this, Australia's decision hasn't been made, or announced, but the Opposition has said they will support the government if it decided to comply with the request. Despite claims that Houthi Rebels are attacking commercial vessels with ballistic missiles, the available information is that they caused no significant damage and no injuries. Reports of a Norwegian ship, and a  Hong Kong-flagged ship, hit by missiles, describe that both ships steamed on. One was scheduled to stop in the port of Ashdod in Israel on January 4, the other, according to a Houthi spokesperson, was headed to Israel, although the carrier's website does not list this. However, this does indicate that the Houthis are targeting what they believe to be vessels heading to Israel.It may be that the US, in an effort to manufacture consent for a wider escalation of this war, is overplaying this threat and some Australian media outlets seem to be slipping this request into an incubator for a consent to go to war with Iran. No evidence has been offered to support this, but many media articles describe the attackers as ""Iran-backed Houthis."" So far, no photos of damage have been offered as evidence, not one ship has been disabled and not one crew-member lost. What really is of great concern is the request of the US to involve non-local players in this conflict. In October, it was reported that the US had sent a second Carrier Strike Group (CSG) into the region. The conflict in Gaza is limited to a few square miles on land, yet the US has two aircraft carriers stationed there. If the goal is to prevent an escalation, calling on Australia and other ""international allies"" to get involved seems contradictory to what the US claims it is trying to achieve.Before the request, Australia took the very unusual step of voting (in a non-binding resolution) against the interests of the US. This is something not seen in a long time. This may have been done to placate a growing domestic opposition to Israel's actions but it makes little difference since the US had already vetoed a ceasefire through the UN.Having used its veto, the US effectively allowed Israel to continue hammering Gaza, resulting in the deaths of many more civilians. This action has caused the US to lose a significant amount of its usual support, as demonstrated by the UN (UNGA) where 153 countries, including Australia, voted in favor of an immediate ceasefire. Australia finds itself in a dilemma as it has voted against the continuation of hostilities, which pleases many in the Australian public, but sending a ship in support of further hostilities would not.Pressure to the Albanese government comes from the fact that it knows much of the population would like Australia to stay out of the conflict but Australia joined Britain and/or the US in every conflict from the Boer War in 1899, up to now. To decline would set a new precedent, albeit a welcomed one.According to a poll, 53 percent of all Australians want an immediate ceasefire. Another poll, reported in the Australian Guardian, suggests that 61 percent want Australia out of the conflict altogether. Australia's lack of involvement in the conflict supports this sentiment. The Guardian also points out that 66 percent are concerned about escalation outside of the region. This concern is justified, considering the potential for domestic escalation. There are approximately 100,000 Jewish Australians and there are more than 800,000 Muslims although less than 3,000 are Palestine. These communities are watching developments and international media reports indicate an increase in both anti-Jewish and anti-Muslim crimes in Australia.The Independent and Peaceful Australia Network (IPAN), a formidable and growing lobby group in a Media release on Monday stated that Australia must refuse US request to send a war ship to the Red Sea. However, politicians, particularly in Australia, don't have a good record of adhering to requests from people seeking peace.Australia is located on the other side of the world. It has citizens from both sides of the conflict and is witnessing growing extremist movements within its own borders.

217,‘Social media regulation VS freedom of speech’ a challenging task for West as well,Global Times,2023-12-19,"In its first probe under the Digital Services Act, the EU is investigating social media company X, formerly known as Twitter, over areas ""linked to risk management, content moderation, dark patterns, advertising transparency and data access for researchers."" According to media reports, this investigation partly relates to the new round of conflict in Gaza.The war on the battlefield has now crossed real national borders and entered the realm of social media in the West. With the escalation of tensions in the Palestine-Israel conflict and the subsequent flow of information on social media, the supervision of social media has become the main agenda for authorities in the US and EU. In October, tech giants Meta and TikTok were sent formal requests for information by the EU, as EU regulators had been concerned about illegal content and disinformation circulating on social media platforms following attacks in the Middle East. Around the same time, US Senator Michael Bennet sought information on how Meta, X, TikTok and Google were trying to stop the spread of false and misleading content.As the EU has launched the investigation into X, in a post on X, Elon Musk asked EU industry chief Thierry Breton if similar action was being taken against other social media platforms. ""Because if you have those issues with this platform, and none are perfect, the others are much worse,"" he added. Shen Yi, director of the Research Institution for Global Cyberspace Governance at Fudan University, told the Global Times that the EU's investigation against X, on one hand, reflects the contradiction between the EU's official stance on the Palestine-Israel conflict and the views of social media users on this issue. On the other hand, it shows that ""freedom of speech"" is a concept largely controlled by West elites, which goes against the values of equal rights and democracy touted by Westerners.The West is currently grappling with a conflict between ""social media regulation"" and ""freedom of speech."" Song Luzheng, a China scholar residing in France and a research fellow at the China Institute of Fudan University, believes that West social media lacks effective management and has always been disorderly. The contradiction between the operators and regulators of social platforms has become more prominent in the context of the Ukraine war and the Palestine-Israel conflict. While the West was the earliest to experience the rise of information technology, it has failed to implement effective supervision. The West is reluctant to abandon the label of ""freedom of speech,"" but it must confront the consequences that come with it. The internet contains enormous power and its political risks are unpredictable. Preventing social media from becoming a dissemination platform for harmful information and preventing such information from endangering social stability and even national interests are the main purposes of countries advocating for strengthening social media supervision. The friction that occurred between the West and emerging countries in the early days of internet management, such as ""the management is undermining freedom of speech,"" is now happening to the West itself. As the West struggles between ""social media regulation"" and ""freedom of speech,"" this delayed intervention by West authorities is causing pain to the West.The nature of social media is openness, which reveals some of the essence and weaknesses of human nature. Management and supervision inevitably mean restrictions. Shen believes that on the issue of regulation of social media and the internet, a convergence is forming globally - everyone realizes that freedom of speech, usually understood in an ideal way, does not exist, and needs to be regulated and guided in the real world. It is a difficult and challenging task for every country. The whole world is in the exploratory stage on how to manage the virtual world, and this exploration will last for a long time.

218,European Parliament's smearing against Xizang's boarding schools violates children's right to education: Chinese FM,Global Times,2023-12-19,"The EU Parliament's attacks and smears against the boarding schools in Xizang are actually a kind of violation of children's right to education, which is damaging to the human rights conditions in Southwest China's Xizang Autonomous Region, the China Foreign Ministry stated on Tuesday.The remarks were made by Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin during a regular press conference on Tuesday, when asked about the EU Parliament's resolution on Thursday criticizing the human rights condition in boarding schools in Xizang.Wang said that Xizang now enjoys a booming economy, harmonious and stable society, and effective protection and promotion of cultural heritage. The rights and freedoms of all ethnic groups, including the freedom of religious belief and the freedom to use and develop their own spoken and written languages, are fully protected, Wang said.The human rights conditions in Xizang are better than ever, as witnessed by the international community. In the case of Xizang, due to highly scattered population, children have to travel long distances to get to school, which is very inconvenient. If schools were to be built in every place the students live, it would be very difficult to ensure adequate teachers and quality of teaching in each school. That is why local governments set up boarding schools according to actual needs to ensure all children's equal right to education, the spokesperson noted.Wang emphasized that it is entirely up to the students and their parents whether to go to boarding schools or not. Students can choose to go home on every weekend, holiday and festival, as well as during the winter and summer breaks. Parents can visit their children at school any time and take their children home whenever needed.Besides, relevant schools open courses of traditional culture, such as Tibetan language and literature and folk dance, provided traditional food unique to the Xizang Plateau, and students are allowed to wear traditional dresses at school, Wang added.""The EU Parliament's attacks and smears against these boarding schools in Xizang are actually a kind of violation of the children's right to education, which is damaging to the human rights conditions in Xizang,"" Wang noted.According to Wang, what's said in the relevant resolution of the EU Parliament is disinformation. It smears China's image and interferes in China's internal affairs. ""We deplore and strongly oppose this, and we urge the EU Parliament to stop spreading disinformation, stop using Xizang-related issues to interfere in China's internal affairs and stop all words and deeds that might undermine the mutual trust and cooperation between China and EU,"" Wang said.The spokesperson said that in recent years, in EU countries, we have seen growing violation of the rights of refugees and migrants, growing xenophobia and racism, inadequate attention to economic, social and cultural rights as well as the right to development, and selective application and double standards when it comes to freedom of the press and forced labor.""If the EU Parliament truly cares about human rights, it should address EU's own issues first and pay attention to human rights violations in places like Gaza, rather than apply double standard and selective negligence, and instrumentalize and weaponize the human rights issue,"" Wang said.Global Times",CHINA,DIPLOMACY,"Children play in a dormitory in Sinopec Primary School in Baingoin county, Nagqu, Southwest China's Xizang Autonomous Region, on October 13, 2023.Photo: Shan Jie/GT",Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'EU Parliament': ('ORG', 5), 'Foreign Ministry': ('ORG', 2), 'Xizang': ('LOC', 5), 'Southwest China': ('LOC', 4), 'Xizang Autonomous Region': ('LOC', 6), 'Xizang Plateau': ('LOC', 6), 'Wang Wenbin': ('PER', 7), 'Tibetan': ('MISC', 1), 'Xi': ('MISC', 3)}"
219,Can the US-led joint patrols defuse the Red Sea alert?: Global Times editorial,Global Times,2023-12-19,"On December 18, US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin announced in Bahrain that the US, along with several other countries, will conduct joint patrols in the southern Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden. This move comes after Houthi militants in Yemen have frequently used missiles and drones to target Israel and US military bases since the outbreak of the recent Palestine-Israel conflict. Recently, they have also attacked Israel-linked vessels in the Red Sea, causing partial disruption to maritime traffic in the region. The US is facing significant pressure, and Austin stated that ""this is an international challenge that demands collective action."" For Washington, which has consistently emphasized its ""dominant position"" in the Middle East, such a stance is an attempt to give itself an out.The Red Sea is one of the world's most critical transportation channels for energy and industrial products, with approximately 20,000 ships passing through the Red Sea and the Suez Canal into the Mediterranean each year. If this route continues to be blocked, vessels will be forced to detour southward around the Cape of Good Hope, resulting not only in extended transportation times but also significant increases in fuel costs and insurance premiums. This will impact the still fragile global supply chain. In 2021, the grounding of the ""Ever Given"" container ship in the Suez Canal led to estimated global trade losses ranging from $6 billion to $10 billion per week. Currently, four major EU shipping giants have successively announced the suspension of passage through the Red Sea. If the crisis continues, the losses inflicted upon global shipping and the world economy will undoubtedly be substantial.The interests involved in Red Sea shipping are so extensive that it is not wrong to characterize the current issues facing the Red Sea as an ""international challenge."" Therefore, the thinking and approach to solving these issues cannot be unilateral, one-way, or simplistic. Houthi forces claimed that their position was not subject to negotiation until Israel ceases military operations in Gaza and allows humanitarian aid to enter. Analysts widely believe the situation in the Red Sea reflects the butterfly effect in the realm of international politics and economics, with Houthi attacks on commercial ships being a manifestation of the spillover effects of the ongoing Palestine-Israel conflict. This once again confirms that in the era of globalization, no local conflict can truly be contained within its ""local"" boundaries.As of December 19, the Palestine-Israel conflict has been ongoing for 74 days and there is still no sign of peace in sight. Bypassing a ceasefire and peace process in Israel and Palestine, making technical arrangements and responses to mitigate spillover events, ultimately addresses symptoms rather than the root cause. In fact, achieving even symptomatic relief proves to be challenging.The Economist, a British magazine, also pointed out in an article on the December 16 that as ""the Houthis have demonstrated that a few drones and missiles can always get through,"" West countries do not have better measures to cope with the situation. Not to mention, the warships of West powers in that area may also accidentally fire, leading to a larger storm in the Middle East.It is worth noting that this joint operation, called ""Operation Prosperity Guardian,"" led by the US military, involves nine countries including the UK, Bahrain, Canada, France, and Italy. It is easy to see that there are few countries from the Middle East region participating, and most of these countries are quite cautious about it. According to reports, Egypt, a strong naval power in the Middle East, as well as Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Oman, and other countries did not participate in this operation. Several other countries agreed to participate but did not want to publicly disclose it. This also indirectly indicates that regional countries have concerns and worries about the joint operation potentially escalating conflicts or undermining the reconciliation process in the Middle East.The geopolitics of the Middle East are extremely complex, and any small action can have far-reaching consequences. The US has initiated numerous wars and instigated many riots in this region, and has also suffered many setbacks and paid a high price. It has enough experience in dealing with Middle East issues, but it is now increasingly at a loss and trapped in a dilemma of solving one problem only to find another cropping up. The root cause is that the US has never taken a fair stance, nor has it taken into consideration interests of the Middle Eastern countries, but rather approaches the Middle East issue based on its own hegemonic needs. It wants strategic contraction, yet still attempts to maintain its ""dominant position"" in the region. It does not want to deeply involve itself in regional conflicts, but still plays the tactics of ""bolster one and bash the other"" to form small interest circles. Such an approach will inevitably only escalate, rather than calm, the turmoil in the region.Since the US recognizes that resolving the Red Sea crisis requires a ""collective action,"" the international community's stance on the fundamental Palestine-Israel issue is very clear. The UN has clearly expressed this through two overwhelming votes, which call for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire. The US cannot stand against the international community and demand its cooperation. To avoid further escalation of the spillover effects of the Palestine-Israel conflict, the key is to return to the fundamental position of peacefully resolving the issue. Specifically, to defuse the ""alert"" in the Red Sea, there is probably no better choice than genuinely promoting a Palestine-Israel ceasefire.",OPINION,EDITORIAL,"US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin speaks at US Navy Central Command headquarters in Manama, Bahrain, on Tuesday.

221,2023 Yearender: China practices sound approach in managing difficult relations,Global Times,2023-12-18,"Editor's Note:In 2023, the world continues to witness significant changes and turbulence. As we approach 2024, we conducted in-depth interviews with leading strategists from various countries and regions to gather their perspectives on the prominent global issues of 2023 and China's role in addressing them.In the second piece of the series, former senior US diplomat Chas Freeman (Freeman) shared his thoughts with Global Times (Global Times) reporter Wang Zixuan, on topics including the prediction of China-US relations before the 2024 presidential election, as well as the potential black swan or gray rhino event may happen in 2024.Global Times: As an experienced diplomat, you have witnessed the whole process of the normalization of China-US relations and accompanied Henry Kissinger, then assistant to the president for national security affairs, on his visit to China in 1971. What do you think is the most important legacy Kissinger left to China-US relations and the world? What can we learn from it?Freeman: I think the major legacy of Kissinger was a strategic relationship between China and the US, which has obviously now largely disappeared, but the legacy is very valuable to both countries.I have to say that Kissinger gets a lot of credit for things he didn't do. The idea of opening to China came from former US president Richard Nixon, and it did prove to be very difficult. It was not until the domestic political difficulties on both sides straightened out that then US president Jimmy Carter and Kissinger, the successor of Zbigniew Brzezinski, were able to achieve the normalization of China-US relations.But I don't think that detracts from Kissinger's achievement. He knew almost nothing about China in the beginning, but then he became fascinated with China. His initial meeting in Beijing with then China Premier Zhou Enlai in 1971 impressed him enormously. He was a strategic and geopolitical thinker, and so was Zhou, so there was a meeting of the minds. Unfortunately, this has gone, and I don't see much prospect of it returning in the short term. Global Times: With the representative older generation figures having passed away, some have said the new generation of China policy experts in the US lacks understanding and respect for China. What's your view? What are the implications for US' China policy?Freeman: I'm not sure how much understanding of China our politicians ever had. I think there were always a lot of misunderstandings. If you look at China-US relations historically, they change almost every 10 years. Going back to World War II, China and the US were allies. In the 1950s, we were enemies in the Korean War. In the 1960s, the US gradually adjusted its relations with China. In the 1970s, we became partners in blocking soviet expansion. In the 1980s, China became the principal partner of the US economically. All of the warmth went out of the relationship in the 1990s. As the relationship matured in the first decade of the 21st century, we had a series of incidents, which were very unpleasant. These were followed by the trade war and technology war started by Donald Trump. I think China-US relations resemble Sino-Soviet relations in some respects. Russia and China had a falling out around 1960s, it took almost 30 years for the two to find each other again, realizing that they had reasons to cooperate. So I think China-US relations are likely to take some time to be restored, because the common interests of the two countries are great.  Global Times: In San Francisco, China President Xi Jinping noted that ""for China and the US, turning their back on each other is not an option, it is unrealistic for one side to remodel the other."" He also stressed that ""the hope of the China-US relationship lies in the people, the vitality comes from exchanges at subnational levels."" What do you think of the way of getting along with the US proposed by China? How will it shape the future of China-US relations?Freeman: I thought Xi Jinping's statements and performance in San Francisco were exemplary. That is good diplomacy. I think there's a long tradition in China of seeking common ground while reserving differences, and this is a sound approach to managing difficult relations. I think he's absolutely correct that the basic support for the relationship is people-to-people relations. I think he was successful in reassuring many US who are favorable to China in the business community. China also values their friendship and wishes to continue to cooperate with them. I think he also wanted to reassure China domestic private sector that he could manage the relationship with the US, and I think he succeeded in that. Global Times: Why does the US continue its containment policy against China even after the friendly meeting? How should we maintain stability after the latest meeting?Freeman: I think it's fair to say that both sides approached this meeting with the objective of improving the tone and the atmosphere of the relationship, but neither side was prepared to make concessions on issues of concern to the other side.The substantive results were very limited. The fact that we can communicate is very important. But as I indicated, I don't see any immediate prospect of an improvement, and I don't think US politics on the China question or China politics on the US question have changed. We have to deal with the fact that we have serious arguments. Some of them, I think, are actually quite ridiculous. It would be better if we had something positive to say to each other which apparently we don't at the moment.Global Times: The Xi Jinping-Joe Biden meeting in San Francisco brings temporary stability to bilateral relations. How do you see China-US relations in 2024, especially before the election? Freeman: I don't expect any real change. On the US side, it is almost impossible to predict what will happen politically. Joe Biden is sinking in the polls. There's widespread dissatisfaction with his conduct of our affairs, both domestic and foreign. After all, he is dealing with basically failed foreign policy in Ukraine and the Middle East, and the Taiwan question is not being successfully managed with China either. I think the US policy toward China is essentially paralyzed. It cannot change, and we will see who is elected in 2024, and whether that person has the ability to reshape public opinion as Nixon did. In 1972, Nixon took a very hostile relationship in view of China and transformed it with a dramatic act. It is not impossible for the same thing to happen again. But I don't think there's anybody who can tell you with any assurance what is going to happen between now and November in 2024. Global Times: Many observers said that the US' Middle East policy is backfiring, why didn't the US foreign policy work well in the Middle East? How do you see China's role in resolving such regional turmoil?Freeman: The US policy in the Middle East is essentially a projection of domestic politics. It reflects the hammerlock on our politics of the Israel lobby, which means that Israel is the centerpiece of the policy. The US is now supporting Israel and what can only be described as genocide in Gaza and the West Bank.As a result, the US is losing a great deal of prestige and has a very damaged reputation in much of the world, even in the West. Grave questions are now being raised about the wisdom of US policy in the Middle East. I think a wise policy is, in fact, to reach out to China on the Ukraine conflict, where China has put forward principles for peace that are impossible to disagree with. As for the Middle East, where China does not have the burden of history that the US does, I think we should be working together to solve these two wars and to end them. China has been very careful to avoid becoming entangled in the quarrels of countries in the Middle East. I think that's been a wise policy. We should be looking to China for help. Global Times: It could be said that the Israel-Palestine conflict is a black swan event of 2023. What black swan or gray rhino event might happen in 2024?Freeman: I don't agree that what happened in the Middle East is a black swan, it was entirely predictable. The only surprise was the military competence of Hamas. There's a possibility that the war between Israel and Palestine will spread. There are some indications of this already. There are many in the Saudi Arabia world who would volunteer to fight the Israelis and Iran may be dragged into this, so that is a very dangerous situation.But I think it's entirely possible that there will be a peace between Kiev and Moscow, maybe with EU support, but excluding the US. And I think that would be a geopolitical event of great magnitude. I think we have not fully seen the effects of the divorce between Russia and EU in terms of the EU economy and EU politics. I should say we were watching the deterioration of the Germany economy, and we're watching Europeans react badly to the trade surplus with China.I don't know what will happen in the Taiwan elections in January, at the moment, it seems more likely that this could produce a crisis, whether it would lead to confrontation between the US and China is not clear. Finally, one other possibility that occurs to me is that the UN, which has been sidelined, may resume a central role in global affairs. You see this with the efforts of the Secretary-General António Guterres to energize the UN on the Middle East problem and his efforts on the Ukraine war.",OPINION,VIEWPOINT,A scene of Shanghai Photo: VCG,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'China': ('LOC', 15), 'US': ('LOC', 10), 'Beijing': ('LOC', 1), 'Chas Freeman': ('PER', 4), 'Wang Zixuan': ('PER', 1), 'Henry Kissinger': ('PER', 6), 'Richard Nixon': ('PER', 1), 'Jimmy Carter': ('PER', 1), 'Zbigniew Brzezinski': ('PER', 1), 'Zhou': ('PER', 2), 'Global Times': ('ORG', 2), 'Times': ('MISC', 1)}"
222,Indian Supreme Court’s unilateral rulings driven by 2024 election consideration,Jin Cuodao,2023-12-18,"The Supreme Court of India upheld Indian government's decision to abolish Article 370 of the Constitution on December 11, and ruled that the government acted lawfully when it revoked the autonomy of the state of Jammu and Kashmir and brought it directly under control of the center.At the same time, the ruling deemed the so-called Ladakh Union Territory, established by the Indian government in 2019, as legally valid. This ruling not only disregards the wishes and interests of the people of Jammu and Kashmir, but also overlooks the bilateral agreements and existing contradictions between India and Pakistan, as well as between China and India. Furthermore, it ignores the consensus and calls from the international community. Pakistan firmly rejects the Supreme Court's ruling, stating that it has ""no legal value"" and that the international law doesn't recognize New Delhi's ""unilateral and illegal actions"" of August 5, 2019. The spokesperson of the China Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated on December 13 that China has never recognized the so-called union territory of Ladakh set up unilaterally and illegally by India. India's domestic judicial verdict does not change the fact that the West section of the China-India border has always belonged to China. The Organization of Islamic Cooperation has also called for the resolution of the regional issue in accordance with the relevant resolutions of the UN. So why did the Indian government once again unilaterally provoke the dispute over the Kashmir issue? First, it may want to take advantage of the current favorable international environment. Currently, the international strategic environment is very favorable to India. The US regards China as its biggest strategic competitor and sees India as a pillar to counterbalance China, so Washington no longer focuses on the Kashmir issue. Pakistan is facing political, economic and social crises and challenges domestically, with weak national strength resulting in a decline in its global strategic position. Currently, India's GDP is around 11 times that of Pakistan, and the significant change in the strength of the two countries clearly favors India, with the gap between them likely to continue to widen. In addition, some Muslim countries value the Indian market and maintain friendly relations with India. In addition, India's move may be related to the 2024 Indian general elections, with Prime Minister Narendra Modi having declared his intention for a third term. Despite leading in opinion polls, Modi faces a challenge from the opposition coalition. The main activities of the Indian government in 2023 as well as the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) are actually geared toward the general elections next year. The revocation of the special status of Indian-administered Kashmir is one of the key promises of the BJP during the 2019 general elections, and the Supreme Court's decision to issue this ruling by the end of 2023 - just a few months before the general elections - is both to endorse and justify the decision of the BJP in 2019, and also to highlight Modi's tough image of practicing what he promises and consolidating his position among the domestic population, especially in the Hindi-speaking regions, to garner more support and votes.Kashmir is an internationally recognized disputed area, and is not an issue that can be resolved by unilateral domestic legislation or by altering maps and constantly reinforcing the narrative of its ownership. India's attempts to endorse the BJP through the Supreme Court of India and to realize its objective of permanent possession by altering the demographic structure of Indian-controlled Kashmir is an act of unilateralism that places domestic laws above international law. This does not find solutions to problems, but rather creates more and more problems. This is a great irony for India, who is striving to become a ""leader of the global South"" and a permanent member of the UN. India's constant unilateral repetition of such behavior cannot be justified and will only lead to opposition from Pakistan and the countries concerned, as well as resentment from the international community, thus resulting in deeper contradictions and fissures. The Kashmir issue, which is a historical legacy of the British colonization, can only be resolved properly and peacefully in accordance with the UN Charter, the UN resolutions and bilateral agreement.In the recent Israel-Palestine conflict, the Indian government had initially strongly supported Israel's campaign against Hamas, reflecting its deep-seated hatred of Muslims and its disdain for disunity in Muslim countries, as it had done in the case of Kashmir. The Supreme Court's ruling will have a negative impact on the regional situation. While resolutely defending its rights and interests, China adheres to its basic position of resolving disputes through dialogue and strives to play a positive and constructive role in maintaining regional peace and stability.The author is a scholar of international studies in Shanghai. opinion@globaltimes.com.cn",OPINION,VIEWPOINT,Illustration: Xia Qing/Global Times,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'Supreme Court of India': ('ORG', 1), 'Supreme Court': ('ORG', 1), 'Ministry of Foreign Affairs': ('ORG', 1), 'Organization of Islamic Cooperation': ('ORG', 1), 'UN': ('ORG', 1), 'Indian': ('MISC', 6), 'Article 370': ('MISC', 1), 'Constitution': ('MISC', 1), 'Muslim': ('MISC', 1), 'Jammu': ('LOC', 2), 'Kashmir': ('LOC', 4), 'Ladakh Union Territory': ('LOC', 2), 'India': ('LOC', 11), 'Pakistan': ('LOC', 4), 'China': ('LOC', 7), 'New Delhi': ('LOC', 1), 'West': ('LOC', 1), 'US': ('LOC', 1), 'Washington': ('LOC', 1), 'Na': ('LOC', 1), 'Mo': ('PER', 1)}"
223,US reported maritime protection force in the Red Sea to have limited effect in curbing conflict spillover,GT staff reporters,2023-12-18,"US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin is reportedly set to announce an expanded maritime protection force involving Saudi Arabia states in the Red Sea in response to the escalating attacks against Israel-bound cargo ships by Yemen's Houthi rebel group. China analysts said by doing so, Washington aims to force its regional allies to become more involved in curbing the spillover of current Palestinian-Israeli Conflict, but predicted that the move would play only limited role in pacifying the situation.Washington should do more to solve the Palestine-Israel conflict than to put in place superficial moves, China experts said, noting that US hypocrisy of calling for cease-fire between Israel and Palestine but constant blocking of UN resolutions on demanding cease-fire in fact fueled Israel's determination of continued military actions. Being the latest Joe Biden administration official to visit Israel, Austin, who arrived in Israel on Monday, is to gain a clearer assessment from Israel officials on their military operations, CNN reported.AP said that Austin is also expected to press Israel to wind down major combat operations in Gaza.Austin is also expected to announce an expanded maritime protection force, to be known as Operation Prosperity Guardian, involving Saudi Arabia states combatting increasingly frequent Houthi attacks being mounted from Yemen's ports on commercial shipping in the Red Sea, the Guardian reported. Yet the report revealed no details over which Saudi Arabia states are expected to join. Protection of shipping routes in the Red Sea is probably the key agenda behind Austin's visit, as the current Palestinian-Israeli Conflict has exerted a huge impact on global economy, Liu Zhongmin, a professor at the Middle East Studies Institute of Shanghai International Studies University, told the Global Times on Monday. He said the Houthi rebel group's attacks have created a dilemma for the US. The attacks, targeting a route that allows East-West trade, especially of oil, to use the Suez Canal to save the time and expense of circumnavigating Africa, have pushed some shipping companies to re-route vessels to avoid the area. For example, France shipping group CMA CGM on Saturday said it was pausing all container shipments through the Red Sea after an attack on one of its container ships, MSC Palatium III, one day earlier, per Reuters. The US is hoping that regional allies become more involved in curbing the spillover effect of current conflict via the proposed protection force, which in reality will only have limited effect, Liu said. Experts noted that the fundamental solution is to continue to call for cease-fire between the conflicting sides, whilst responding violence with violence will only fuel the current conflict. France, the UK and Germany -some of Israel's closest allies- joined global calls for a cease-fire over the weekend, and Israel protesters have demanded the government relaunch talks with the militant group on releasing more hostages after three were mistakenly killed by Israel troops while waving a white flag.In response, Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has insisted that Israel will keep fighting until it removes Hamas from power, crushes its military capabilities and returns the hostages, the New York Times reported on Sunday.Liu noted that the increasing international and domestic pressure are not enough for Israel to change its military action in Gaza as those pressure are mostly at surface level. Moreover, the US is calling for cease-fire in public, yet it is giving Israel green light in the UN by opposing UN's cease-fire resolutions.",CHINA,SOCIETY,"Smoke billows over the southern Gaza Strip during Israeli bombardment on December 17, 2023, amid continuing battles between Israel and Hamas.

224,"Red Sea attacks intensify, major global shippers avoid Suez Canal",Yin Yeping,2023-12-18,"Several global shipping lines plan to steer clear of the Suez Canal, while the escalating situation in the Red Sea, coupled with attacks on cargo ships, has heightened concerns in the global shipping industry.The new routes around the Cape of Good Hope entail additional transportation costs, increasing risks and extending transit times. Experts said that this will intensify the challenges the industry faces amid a sluggish economic and trade recovery and high inflation worldwide.""Recent attacks on commercial vessels in the area are alarming and pose a significant threat to the safety and security of seafarers. We are deeply concerned about the highly escalated security situation in the southern Red Sea and Gulf of Aden,"" global shipping conglomerate Maersk said in a statement sent to the Global Times on Monday.Following a near-miss against the Maersk Gibraltar on December 14 and yet another attack on a container vessel the day after, ""we have instructed all Maersk vessels in the area bound to pass through the Bab al-Mandab Strait to pause their journey until further notice,"" the shipping company said.Other major freight lines including MSC said on Saturday that they won't transit the Suez Canal in either direction.This came after the container ship MSC Palatium III was attacked on December 15 while transiting the Red Sea under sub-charter to the Messina Line.Evergreen Marine Co announced on Monday evening that given that fiercely escalation of war situation in recent days, the company will temporarily suspend Israel import and export services due to rising risks and safety considerations with immediate effect until further notice.Yemen's Houthi rebels on December 14 claimed a drone attack on an Israel-bound cargo ship in the Red Sea. The rebel group has vowed to prevent all Israel-bound commercial ships from passing through the Red Sea until the ongoing Israel war on the Palestine enclave of the Gaza ends, the Xinhua reported.This incident is likely to further drive up shipping rates.If unable to pass through the Red Sea, vessels will need to detour around the Cape of Good Hope, adding an estimated 7,000 to 10,000 kilometers and an extra seven to 10 days to the journey, the Global Times learned.In the morning session on Monday, the shipping sector surged by 4.72 percent, leading gains in both the Shenzhen Stock Exchange and the Shanghai Stock Exchange. Both Ningbo Ocean Shipping Co and China Master Logistics Co hit the limit-up and closed at the day's limit of 10 percent.This year, the container shipping industry has faced challenges such as weakening demand. China industry experts said that the situation, if it intensifies, will have a serious impact on global shipping, leading to hikes in rates and costs, given the importance of the Suez Canal for global trade.The Suez Canal is one of the world's largest maritime arteries, and its role is especially crucial as the Panama Canal faces a severe drought, significantly reducing its navigational capacity, Zhong Zhechao, founder of One Shipping, an international logistics service consulting firm, told the Global Times on Monday.Serving as a major passage for Asia-EU, Asia-Mediterranean and Asia-US East Coast routes, the Suez Canal's impact on global trade and shipping has become increasingly vital. The Houthi rebels' attacks further underscore the importance of the Red Sea and the Bab el-Mandeb Strait, a key gateway to the Suez Canal, Zhong said.In less than a month, at least 16 vessels of various types have been attacked or even seized. So far, at least five out of the world's largest seven shipping companies have suspended passage through the Red Sea. These five giants hold up to around half of the global shipping market.China experts believe that the Red Sea situation will have a much greater impact on the global shipping industry than the Suez Canal obstruction in March 2021 when the Ever Given, a container ship that had run aground in the canal, blocked the channel.",SOURCE,ECONOMY,"The photo taken on on April 21, 2023 shows Phase 4 automated terminal at Yangshan Port in Shanghai.

225,"Yearender: Roles that China plays in a world of great turbulence in 2023: crisis mediator, builder of peace, promoter of cooperation",Yang Sheng,2023-12-18,"After the three-year-long COVID-19 pandemic, at the beginning of 2023, China, together with the rest of the world, has hit the reset bottom and attached great hope to rebuilding a world based on development, peace and prosperity. However, unfortunately, the global recovery remains fragile and uncertain. The Russia-Ukraine conflict has become bogged in stalemate after the failed counteroffensive launched by Kiev, and the brutal war once again erupted between Israel and Palestine. Not limited to EU and Middle East, the whole world has witnessed a year of conflict, including the civil war in Sudan which began in April and a coup in Niger in July, the conflict between Azerbaijan and Armenia on the disputed region Nagorno-Karabakh in Central Asia, as well as the military conflict in north Myanmar over recent months. China scholars and foreign affairs experts said that the world entered ""a period of great turbulence"" in 2023. China has continued to play a role as a responsible major power throughout these conflicts, making efforts like sending naval vessels to evacuate people including China nationals and other countries from conflict zones, and in some cases China also actively mediating the conflict through diplomatic channels. ""Throughout history, periods of turbulence normally emerge when an old order has collapsed or becomes dysfunctional, and the newly emerging powers are trying to reshape or build up a new order to solve the problems that the old order failed to resolve,"" Jin Canrong, associate dean of the School of International Studies at the Renmin University of China, told the Global Times. Nevertheless, apart from bad news like wars and tension, there is also good news about cooperation and reconciliation. From China-brokered agreement between Saudi Arabia and Iran on the restoration of diplomatic relations, to the historic expansion of BRICS, as well as the Belt and Road Forum (BRF) for International Cooperation which is engendering confidence in both openness and international cooperation, China, together with its partners worldwide, is trying to keep hopes for peace and development in this period of turbulence, experts said. The role that China plays during this period is crucial for the world.  China is trying its best to avoid conflicts and manage disputes diplomatically and through political consensus. In 2023, China also contributed its wisdom and efforts to provide the valuable elements that the world is searching for: peace, openness, opportunities, responsibility, certainty and justice.    How to deal with the West?For China diplomacy in 2023, a significant question has been about how to deal with the West, experts said. There are many West countries with different interests, preferences and priorities, and how to manage differences, avoid conflicts, rebuild mutual trusts, and seek cooperation with West countries is key for China and the world to prevent escalation of bloc confrontation and a new cold war, they noted.Relations between China and the West have experienced some challenges in 2023. For instance, the ""China-US balloon crisis"" in February, but China took a mature approach to prevent the situation from escalating. ""Interactions between China and the West this year have largely reflected the strategic calmness of China. In the past few years, the mainstream of China-West relations has become more about 'tit-for-tat' and 'not yield an inch', and these characteristics still exist today, but this year, China's approach becomes more flexible,"" Cui Hongjian, a professor with the Academy of Regional and Global Governance with Beijing Foreign Studies University, told the Global Times.  China is now trying to figure out how to shape its ties with major West powers to establish a ""global strategic stability"" for itself, and this is not just about bilateral ties with other countries, but in terms of global landscape, Cui noted. In November, a summit between China President Xi Jinping and US President Joe Biden that was specially arranged by the US side in San Francisco has brought a key message to the world that the two biggest economies and the two most powerful countries in this planet are able to manage their differences and competition, and also willing to seek possibilities for cooperation.China scholars called the successful trip by Xi Jinping to the US as a sign that shows China-US relations have ""stopped worsening and started to stabilize,"" despite Washington continuing its policy of provocation and hostile approaches across many fronts, including suppression in the science and technology field and its aggressive military presences in the South China Sea and Taiwan Straits.In 2023, the Joe Biden administration dispatched a number of senior officials including Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo and climate envoy John Kerry to visit China. These moves that reflect Washington's desperate demand for engagement and dialogue have not just laid ground for the Xi Jinping-Joe Biden summit, but also prompted other West countries, or US key allies, to recover their ties with China based on their own demands, experts said. For instance, China-Australia relations have recovered at least in terms of trade and people-to-people exchanges, while Japan and South Korea are also trying to improve their ties with China, to seek cooperation and pave way for another trilateral summit next year.On November 24, 2023, Member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Foreign Minister Wang Yi met the press alongside France Minister for EU and Foreign Affairs Catherine Colonna following talks in Beijing, during which he said that ""As long as China and EU join hands, bloc confrontation will not occur, the world will not fall apart, and a new Cold War will not take place.""During their meeting with Xi Jinping on December 7, President of the EU Council Charles Michel and President of the EU Commission Ursula von der Leyen noted that ""the EU and China are two major forces of the world and important trading partners for each other. The areas of EU-China cooperation continue to expand...The EU highly values its ties with China, and does not want to decouple from China. It seeks a long-term, stable, predictable and sustainable relationship with China.""""With growing influence and power, China is becoming increasingly mature in handling its ties with the West. If we always let the competition or even confrontation dominate the relations with the West, it would definitely damage supply chains, industrial chains, trade and investment. This is not just bad for China, but also bad for the global recovery,"" Cui said.The recoveries of ties between China and many West countries this year have reduced the danger and risk across the international landscape. But China is also prepared for potential flashpoints that might occur in the future because of the West, especially the US, given its uncertainty, and highly unpredictable domestic politics. It's clear that the US still sees China as its top competitor, so China will maintain a clear mindset rather than being idealistic when dealing with the West, experts said. Gifts to a turbulent world In March, with China's mediation, Saudi Arabia and Iran, two major powers in Middle East that suffered from long-standing confrontation, reached agreement to rebuild diplomatic ties with each other in Beijing. This is a significant gift to the world that desperately needs peace and economic recovery, and this becomes the starting point for a great reconciliation process in the Middle East, with some observers even saying that those West media with strong bias and hostility against China have failed to find angles to undermine China on this issue.Seyed Hamzeh Safavi, director of Institute for Islamic World Future Studies in Iran, told the Global Times at the Beijing Xiangshan Forum in November that China's mediation between Iran and Saudi Arabia was a very good example to all major powers. The Middle East has long suffered from the intervention of major external powers. ""But in history, I think this was a first step and the first example for a foreign power to play a very good role between Iran and Saudi Arabia. Thanks to the China effort for that,"" he said.In August, the BRICS summit in South Africa has brought encouraging message of historic expansion, welcoming six new members. In October, at the third BRF, attended by representatives, including heads of state, government chiefs and senior officials, from over 140 countries and 30-plus international organizations, China announced eight major steps that the country will take to support high-quality Belt and Road cooperation and to realize another ""golden decade"" as part of this new journey.   Li Haidong, a professor at the China Foreign Affairs University, told the Global Times on Sunday that ""it's hard to imagine that without all of this good news that contributed by China or jointly contributed by China and its partners, the 2023 would have been a year full of bad news like war, conflicts, tension and instability. When other major powers are focusing on strategic competition, zero-sum thinking, and bloc confrontation and so on, China is the last major power still fighting for economic globalization, peace-making and development.""China's ""peace-focused approach"" is a prominent aspect of its 2023 diplomatic agenda, according to Xu Bu, director-general of the Institute of Global Development and Security Studies of Jiangsu University.  ""This approach has been widely recognized and welcomed internationally. In the context of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, China has sent the special envoy to mediate and promote negotiation-based resolutions. Similarly, China's active role in mediating the Israel-Palestine conflict as the rotating chair of the UN has been highly commended,"" he said.From actively mediating conflicts to provide opportunities and platforms for cooperation, China has done a lot through its diplomatic efforts for the world that desperately wants peace and development this year. The year of 2023 underscores the challenges and risks in the global landscape, including economic developments and geopolitical security. ""The upcoming US elections in 2024 will not only influence China-US relations but also the overall international landscape,"" meaning China needs to remain vigilant and committed to its development path, contributing to global peace, stability, and the construction of a community with a shared future for humanity, Xu noted.",CHINA,DIPLOMACY,"This photo taken on Oct. 14, 2023 shows a floral decoration for the third Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation (BRF) near China National Convention Center in Beijing, capital of China.

226,"Killing of hostages is tragic, but it can hardly stop Israel’s operation in Gaza: expert",Yang Sheng,2023-12-17,"
After Israel forces mistakenly killed three Israel hostages in Gaza, the head of Israel intelligence agency Mossad met Qatar’s prime minister in Oslo to discuss the release of the remaining hostages, media reported, as some observers believe it could signal hope for another temporary cease-fire to enable swapping Hamas-held hostages for Israel-held Palestine prisoners. The three Israel hostages killed by Israel forces Friday night were shot after they emerged shirtless from a building in northern Gaza, holding up a stick with a white cloth on it, Israel military officials said Saturday, the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) reported. The decision by two Israel soldiers to open fire violated the military’s rules of engagement, Herzi Halevi, an Israel senior military officer, said late on Saturday.The new details about the incident emerged as Israel and Qatari officials met in Norway on Saturday in order to revive talks about the release of hostages held in Gaza in return for a cease-fire and the freeing of Palestine prisoners held by Israel, according to people familiar with the matter, the WSJ reported on Saturday.Some observers said this could be a chance for another exchange of hostages and prisoners, and allow more humanitarian aid to get into the Gaza, and it could even transform into a sustained cease-fire. Apart from the hostage issue, the US is also pressuring Israel. US President Joe Biden said Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu must change tack, warning that Israel’s “indiscriminate bombing” in Gaza risked leaving the country isolated, the Financial Times reported on Wednesday.Offering his harshest criticism of the Israel prime minister’s far-right coalition since the Jewish state began its military offensive in response to Hamas’s October 7 attack, the US president said Israel was “starting to lose… support” around the world.The hostage deaths have intensified pressure on Netanyahu's government to take new steps to free the 129 remaining hostages. Israel’s war cabinet was set to meet later on Saturday to discuss whether to officially resume hostage talks with mediators, the people said. In Tel Aviv and other Israel cities, protesters called on Saturday night for new efforts to secure the hostages’ release and for Netanyahu to step down, the WSJ reported.However, the hostage issue might not be able to overtake Israel’s claimed mission of eliminating Hamas in Gaza, which means taking control of the region and rebuilding it based on Israel’s preferences, said some experts.Wang Jin, an associate professor at the Institute of Middle Eastern Studies of Northwest University, told the Global Times on Sunday that “although the media reported that the Netanyahu is facing pressure, the hostage issue has never been the top priority. Most Israel people care more about ending the conflict once and for all by not giving Hamas any breathing space.”",WORLD,MID-EAST,"Smoke billows over the southern Gaza Strip during Israeli bombardment on December 17, 2023, amid continuing battles between Israel and Hamas.

227,Ukraine - another lost US/NATO war with no regrets,Jan Oberg,2023-12-16," One of the enigmatic aspects of international politics is that big and militarily superior countries have systematically lost wars in smaller countries over the last 50 years, from Vietnam to Ukraine. ""Losing"" here means military defeat, being forced out, losing the struggle for the hearts and minds of the people, and facing fiasco when it comes to achieving the professed noble motives like introducing human rights, democracy, freedom or liberating women. And given the tremendous human costs, particularly in the Middle East, the US' ""Global War on Terror"" since September 11, 2001 is also an intellectual and moral disaster.The US - by far the world's largest military spender, interventionist, warrior, occupier, global base-builder with the most militarized foreign policy - is in a class of its own. In losing wars too.It is now rapidly losing legitimacy, relevance and credibility in the eyes of most of the world outside US/NATO/EU/ANPO/AUKUS. Firstly, all these imperial militarist adventures have been woefully anti-intellectual and imbued with the arrogance of power, elements of racism and hubris. Secondly, after quite predictable fiascos and defeats - such as in Iraq - there comes a time when propaganda, psychological operations (PSYOPS), media influencing, and psycho-political projection no longer do the trick.There comes a time, too, when even the biggest military spender and economy cannot finance its weapons addiction and its arsenals of weapons and ammunition dry up.It's called over-extension and diminishing legitimacy in the eyes of others, it's called militarism to death and is transforming into imperial decline and eventual fall. No empires have lasted forever and that of the US/NATO world will be the last. No one is so foolish to believe that, in an incredibly diverse world, everybody else would accept one player to be the all-dominating system and shape others into its own image. Missionary times are a thing of the past. Enter Ukraine. NATO set itself up in Kiev immediately after it became independent and declared in 2008 that it would become a member of the alliance. It was a gross violation of the promises indisputably given to the last Soviet President, Michael Gorbachev, but such was the unipolar we-can-do-whatever-we-want sentiment. In an autistic manner, NATO refused to listen to Russia's legitimate security concerns and also did not bother about the fact that there was only a tiny minority among the Ukraine people in favour of membership of NATO. Instead, a regime change in Kiev was all that was needed: installing a pro-West leadership, paying it well and giving it an offer it could not refuse by wooing it step-by-step into the ever-expanding alliance.Russia then put its foot down, and insult had to be added to injury: We will help you, Ukraine, for as long as it takes for you to win ""our"" war against Russia and ""weaken"" it; you'll be covered the whole way, just fight for us to the last Ukraine. Thus, Part One with the expansion and wooing, and Part Two with the militarization and proxy war - but no membership of NATO, which would commit NATO troops to Ukraine soil and cost NATO lives. Now comes Part Three - the abandonment and Ukraine on desolation row to be fixed by a faltering EU.  Here, the Palestine-Israel conflict comes in handy. The political and media attention on Ukraine has diminished significantly, while Ukraine's counter-offensive has stalled, and internal conflicts in Kiev accelerate. The NATO blame game is on: We gave you all the weapons, ammunition and training we could, but you did not manage the military struggle well; your leadership is falling apart, and you are not as grateful to us as we had expected, and so on. And do not expect NATO or EU membership in the near future (no matter what we say for the public).Obviously, nobody wants to be associated with such a political, economic, military, legal and moral fiasco. Not the US and NATO's leaders, who, from a historical perspective, provoked it in Part One and, instead of admitting it, continued to Part Two and Three.The EU has not been able to develop its own policies on the Ukraine conflict. It followed the US blindly, installed history's toughest sanctions and completely isolated the largest EU state, Russia, from EU. Sweden and Finland willingly let themselves be pushed into NATO for no serious reason. Then followed the destruction of the Nord Stream pipelines, the largest ever infrastructure destruction (most likely carried out by the US because President Joe Biden and other leaders said they would do just that and because of the silence and lack of official reports explaining who did what). Weapons depots are becoming emptied, and now, to put it crudely, the Union looks increasingly wobbly politically while undergoing its deepest ever economic crisis. Germany's economic and political situation looks bleak. The EU area is likely to also be heavily hit by the long-term repercussions of the violence in the Middle East.The EU's helter-skelter knee-jerk reaction to Russia's military operations in Ukraine prevented any analyses of likely consequences in the short-, mid- and long-term of these measures, which were as ill-considered and irrational as they were drastic. Russia, on the other hand, will get out of this quagmire much better than the EU.While the US is comparatively well protected from the negative consequences of its policies, its EU allies are not. The burdens on the civilian economy caused by warfare, militarism, tremendous re-armament, and refugee flows - and thereby, depletion of resources urgently needed for EU infrastructure, climate change measures and welfare investments - paint a dark picture of the future. It will likely become a guns-before-butter society, and future generations will have to pay the bills.As time goes by, people will take to the street - for themselves and/or in support of, say, the Palestine. Simultaneously, the far right will see its dawn as the economic crisis deepens.While the West declines and implodes - more with a whimper than with a bang - one scenario for the next decade or so may well contain the fragmentation and possible dissolution of NATO.The author is director of the Sweden-based think tank Transnational Foundation for Peace & Future Research. opinion@globaltimes.com.cn",OPINION,VIEWPOINT,Illustration: Chen Xian/Global Times,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'Vietnam': ('LOC', 1), 'Ukraine': ('LOC', 2), 'Middle East': ('LOC', 1), 'US': ('LOC', 4), 'Iraq': ('LOC', 1), 'Kiev': ('LOC', 1), 'Global War on Terror': ('MISC', 1), '11': ('MISC', 1), 'Soviet': ('MISC', 1), 'NATO': ('ORG', 3), 'EU': ('ORG', 1), 'ANPO': ('ORG', 1), 'AUKUS': ('ORG', 1), 'Michael': ('PER', 1)}"
228,1st meeting of China-Saudi Arabia-Iran trilateral joint committee concludes; MidEast should 'no longer be geopolitical arena' for great powers,Global Times,2023-12-16," The Middle East should no longer be a geopolitical arena of great powers, and the fate of the region should be in the hands of the people, said Wang Yi, member of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee and China Foreign Minister, in meeting with Saudi Arabia Deputy Foreign Minister Waleed Elkhereiji and Iran Deputy Foreign Minister for Political Affairs Ali Bagheri Kani on Friday in Beijing. Wang, also director of the Office of the Foreign Affairs Commission of the CPC Central Committee, said China always supports the people of the Middle East in independently exploring development paths, supports the Middle East countries in working together to solve regional security issues, and supports Saudi Arabia and Iran in continuously advancing the process of improving relations.The first meeting of the China-Saudi Arabia-Iran trilateral joint committee concluded in Beijing on Friday.China is willing to use this trilateral meeting as an opportunity to inject new impetus into the good-neighborly friendship between Saudi Arabia and Iran and make new contributions to promoting peace and stability in the Middle East, Wang said.During the meeting, Wang put forward three suggestions on continuing to advance the process of improving relations between Saudi Arabia and Iran. To begin with, he emphasized the importance of steadfastly adhering to the strategic decision of reconciliation. It is desired that Saudi Arabia and Iran will continue to build trust through dialogue and consultation, ultimately achieving a long-lasting and comprehensive friendly relationship. Additionally, he proposed further advancements in improving relations. China warmly welcomes Saudi Arabia and Iran to actively explore cooperation and expand exchanges in various areas such as economy, trade, security, and people-to-people exchanges. China is also prepared to strengthen exchanges with both sides to assist in enhancing relations. Lastly, he called for the rejection of external interference in dealing with improving relations between Saudi Arabia and Iran. Wang emphasized that the Middle East can no longer be an arena for great powers, and the fate of the Middle East should be determined by the people of the regional countries themselves.During the trilateral meeting, Saudi Arabia and Iran expressed their commitment to the full implementation of the Beijing Agreement reached in March.China, Saudi Arabia and Iran all expressed concerns over the current situation in the Gaza and the West Bank of the Jordan River, believing that it poses a threat to regional and international peace and security. They called for the immediate cessation of military actions in the Gaza and the provision of sustainable assistance to civilians, while opposing the forced displacement of Palestine. The three parties stressed that any arrangements concerning the future of Palestine must reflect the will of the Palestine people and support their right to establish a state and exercise self-determination. ""The pressing task is to push for a ceasefire and cessation of fighting in Gaza, advance humanitarian aid and resume Palestinian-Israeli Conflict negotiations,"" Wang said, emphasizing that any solution to the conflict should be based on respect of the will of the Palestine people and the legitimate concerns of regional countries, and should not deviate from a two-state solution.China supports Saudi Arabia and Iran in jointly pushing Islamic countries to form a stronger unified position on the escalation of the Palestinian-Israeli Conflict, Wang said. During their meeting with Wang, Elkhereiji and Bagheri thanked China for hosting the trilateral meeting, saying Saudi Arabia and Iran welcome and support China's greater role in the development of the Middle East.On the International Day of Solidarity with the Palestine People that falls on November 29, China announced several practical actions, including the releasing of a paper stating China's position on resolving the Palestinian-Israeli Conflict.The China People's Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries, the Embassy of Palestine in China, and the Representative Office of the League of Saudi Arabia States in Beijing jointly held a commemoration for the day on Friday.Palestine Ambassador to China and Head of the Saudi Arabia Mission in China Fariz Mahdawi who attended the event expressed his appreciation for the fair stance and positive role that China has taken on the Palestine issue.Global Times",CHINA,DIPLOMACY,Photo: mfa.gov.cn,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'Middle East': ('LOC', 6), 'China': ('LOC', 7), 'Saudi Arabia': ('LOC', 10), 'Iran': ('LOC', 10), 'Beijing': ('LOC', 3), 'Gaza': ('LOC', 2), 'West': ('LOC', 1), 'Jordan': ('LOC', 1), 'Wang Yi': ('PER', 5), 'Waleed Elkhereiji': ('PER', 1), 'Ali Bagheri Kani': ('PER', 1), 'Political Bureau': ('ORG', 1), 'Communist Party of China': ('ORG', 1), 'CPC': ('ORG', 1), 'Central Committee': ('ORG', 1), 'Office of': ('ORG', 1), 'Foreign Affairs Commission': ('ORG', 1), 'CPC Central Committee': ('ORG', 2)}"

234,Biden administration's subtle change in tone hints at 'possible decrease in aid to Kiev',GT staff reporters,2023-12-13,"The tone of the Joe Biden administration on aid to Ukraine has seen subtle changes from being a commitment for ""as long as it takes"" to ""as long as we can"" during Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky's latest visit in Washington, where he is making a last-ditch plea to US lawmakers as an aid package with billions in funds for the country stalls amid partisan disagreements over immigration policies.Such a change in tone could signal a possible decrease of US aid to Ukraine against the backdrop of increasing GOP skepticism in Congress, observers said on Wednesday. Standing alongside the Ukraine leader at a White House press conference on Tuesday local time, US President Joe Biden announced that ""We'll continue to supply Ukraine with critical weapons and equipment as long as we can,"" NBC News reported. Joe Biden's administration has long committed to supporting Ukraine for ""as long as it takes,"" but funding appropriated by lawmakers is set to run out by year's end, according to media reports.Joe Biden's latest remarks have left room for the possibility of the US reducing aid to Ukraine, Cui Heng, a scholar from the China National Institute for SCO International Exchange and Judicial Cooperation, told the Global Times on Wednesday. With the end of the year approaching and Congress about to go on recess, it is very difficult for Joe Biden to garner congressional support to continue aiding Ukraine due to the severe partisan disagreement. Therefore, Joe Biden's remarks actually gave himself an out, so if he fails to secure aid for Ukraine, he can claim that he did his best, Cui explained. On December 4, the White House warned Congress that the administration will run out of resources to provide aid to Ukraine unless Congress takes action by the end of the year. In a letter to congressional leaders, Office of Management and Budget Director Shalanda Young stressed the US is ""out of money - and nearly out of time"" to provide weapons and equipment to Ukraine, NBC News reported.Young's letter comes as lawmakers on both sides of the aisle are deadlocked over approving US aid to Israel and Ukraine. Republican seek to condition foreign aid on the enactment of tougher US policy surrounding migrants arriving at the southern US border.However, House Speaker Mike Johnson pushed back at Young's letter Monday morning on X, saying Republican will not budge on their calls to condition aid to Ukraine on changes in US border enforcement and asylum laws.""The Joe Biden administration has failed to substantively address any of my conference's legitimate concerns about the lack of a clear strategy in Ukraine, a path to resolving the conflict, or a plan for adequately ensuring accountability for aid provided by US taxpayers,"" he wrote.Zelensky on Tuesday spoke with lawmakers in a closed-door gathering on Capitol Hill, where there is growing GOP skepticism about providing more financial and military support for Ukraine, according to media report. ""I don't think it changed the nature of the conversation here in Washington,"" said Senator JD Vance, a GOP lawmaker who has argued that it's in America's best interest for Ukraine to cede some of its land to end the war.The EU has also showed fatigue over supply to Kiev, marked by the latest event where Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban has threatened to block moves to give Kiev 50 billion euros in budget support through 2027 and the green light for membership talks - a key strategic objective for Ukraine, Reuters reported.The increasing domestic skepticism within the US over the supply to Kiev has made more people in the international community realize that the US is the instigator who creates chaos at the cost of interests of Ukraine and the EU. More in the EU are adjusting their approach and policies toward such chaos created by the US in the first place, Li Haidong, a professor at the China Foreign Affairs University, told the Global Times on Wednesday.",CHINA,DIPLOMACY,"Smoke rises above the area of the frontline town of Avdiivka, Ukraine on October 18, 2023.

235,UNGA vote 'barometer of global concern'; US increasingly 'isolated' in supporting Israel,Liu Xin,2023-12-13,"The latest resolution that calls for a ceasefire in Gaza and passed by large majority is an important barometer of global concern over the dire humanitarian crisis in the Gaza, and it indicates that the US is increasingly isolated in its support for Israel, analysts said, calling for more humanitarian aid and political and diplomatic mediation to avoid the conflict from spilling over.On Tuesday, the UN passed a resolution, which calls for an immediate humanitarian cease-fire by a vote of 153 in favor, 10 against and 23 abstentions. None of the major powers joined Israel and the US in their opposition to the resolution. The resolution, which was submitted by Egypt on behalf of Saudi Arabia countries, expressed serious concern about the humanitarian situation in Gaza, calling for an immediate humanitarian cease-fire and calling on all parties to comply with their obligations under international law, to effectively protect civilians, and to immediately release all hostages.China welcomed the resolution's high-vote passage at the General Assembly and said it reflects the will of the international community and must be fully and effectively implemented, said China's Permanent Representative to the UN Zhang Jun, according to a release from the website of China's Permanent Mission to the UN.The humanitarian disaster in the Gaza has reached a point where it is beyond description, and it must not be allowed to worsen. A cease-fire is the overriding priority, and the international community must make an immediate cease-fire its common goal and the most urgent matter, Zhang said. Zhang added that China will continue to play a responsible role in making unremitting efforts to restore peace, save lives, and alleviate the humanitarian situation.Tuesday's vote came as the death toll in Gaza has been climbing. Israel's retaliation against Hamas attacks has killed more than 18,000 Palestine and wounded 50,000, and more than 80 percent of Gaza's 2.3 million residents have been displaced, according to media reports. In October, the UN also passed a resolution that called for ""an immediate, durable and sustained humanitarian truce leading to a cessation of hostilities"" with 121 votes in favor and 14 against, also including the US. The overwhelming vote supporting the resolution shows that the US and Israel are facing scant support and moral pressure as Israel continues to push its military actions in Gaza which are causing a deteriorating humanitarian crisis, Liu Zhongmin, a professor at the Middle East Studies Institute of Shanghai International Studies University, told the Global Times. Unlike UN votes, resolutions adopted by the UN have the power to be binding. Due to the US, the UN is finding it hard to act on the Palestine issue, Liu said.On December 8, the UN failed again to pass a resolution on the Palestine issue which also called for a humanitarian cease-fire but the US vetoed the proposal. As it faces increasing criticism and pressure, the US is more two-faced and continues to back Israel at the UN while loudly urging Israel to minimize casualties of civilians,  Liu said.On Tuesday, Joe Biden said that Israel is losing support over its ""indiscriminate"" bombing of Gaza and that Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu should change, in stark contrast to his earlier rhetoric of support for Netanyahu.Despite warnings from the US, Israel is continuing its military assaults in Gaza. On Tuesday, Israel's military reportedly begun pumping seawater into the Gaza tunnels said to be occupied by Hamas, according to media reports. According to analysts, there is now little chance that Israel will stop its operations in Gaza since the Netanyahu administration wants to completely reshape order in Gaza and destroy Hamas.Israel's plan to pump seawater into underground tunnel system in Gaza aims to force Hamas to get out of the subterranean network of passages. But if it does, the humanitarian and ecological damage would be disastrous, Liu said. The international community and the US should exert more pressure on Israel and people should be held accountable for any actions that violate international laws, Liu said, noting that more humanitarian aid should be offered to relieve the shortage of daily necessities in Gaza. Moreover, diplomatic mediation is also needed to avoid a spill-over of the conflict, said Liu.",CHINA,DIPLOMACY,"This photo taken on Dec. 10, 2023 shows damaged buildings after an Israeli airstrike in Maghazi refugee camp, central Gaza Strip.

236,"China holds state commemoration for 300,000 victims of Nanjing Massacre",Liu Caiyu,2023-12-13,"China held its 10th national memorial ceremony on Wednesday to mourn  the 300,000 victims of the Nanjing Massacre. During the day, former curator of the Memorial Hall of the Victims in Nanjing Massacre by Japanese Invaders called for the younger generation to remember the painful memories and dedicate themselves to contributing to the development of the nation.Early Wednesday morning, the national flag was flown at half-mast at the Memorial Hall of the Victims in Nanjing Massacre by Japanese Invaders in Nanjing. Then at exactly 10:01 am, blaring sirens initiated a complete standstill in Nanjing, capital of East China's Jiangsu Province. Motorists in the downtown vicinity halted their vehicles and honked their horns, while pedestrians paused to observe a moment of silence as a tribute to the victims.The Nanjing Massacre took place when Japanese troops captured the city on December 13, 1937. Over six weeks, they killed approximately 300,000 China civilians and unarmed soldiers in one of the most barbaric episodes of World War II.In order to remember the victims, the Shanghai Songhu Anti-Japanese War Memorial Hall specially launched an ""online memorial ceremony"" program to carry out online mourning activities, during which citizens could light virtual candles and express their condolences.Students at Shanghai Shangde Experimental School recited ""In the Name of Faith to the Future You,"" to memorialize the victims. The affectionate recitation enabled everyone to recall the history, and express the good wishes of young people in the new era to realize their dreams for China.Though large snowflakes fell from the sky in Beijing, teachers and students at universities in the capital also held mourning activities at the Museum of the War of People's Resistance Against Japanese Aggression on Wednesday morning to remember the  national heroes who gave their precious lives to achieve victory in the war.The participants at the museum lined up neatly and sang the national anthem, after which a moment of silence was observed. On Lugou Bridge in Beijing, where the Japanese imperialists provoked the Lugou Bridge Incident in 1937, and using this as the starting point to launch a long-premeditated all-out war on China, Zhang Yinghao, a veteran from North China's Hebei Province, told the Global Times, ""Today is a day worth commemorating. Even though I can't be in Nanjing, I'm here where the war began amid this heavy snow to pay tribute to the memory of the martyrs in a unique manner. May we live in peace and may our motherland grow stronger.""""This event serves to reinforce the significance of this historical period and ensure that it is not forgotten, particularly by the younger generation. By keeping these painful memories alive, we are reminded of the war and national tragedy, which in turn motivates and empowers youth to contribute to the nation's development and work toward building a community with a shared future for mankind, which also calls for lasting peace, Zhu Chengshan, former curator of the Memorial Hall of the Victims in Nanjing Massacre by Japanese Invaders, told the Global Times on Wednesday.Zhu noted that Wednesday marked the 10th national memorial day for the victims of the Nanjing Massacre and that sirens were sounded across Nanjing 10 times, while more and more international friends have noticed the memorial day and joined China to call for peace. At Wednesday's memorial ceremony in Nanjing, Zhu said he had noticed the presence of friends from the US, Japan and Malaysia. ""Both China and foreigners share a common goal of desiring peace and sustainability. It is crucial to prioritize peace, especially in light of the ongoing conflicts in Ukraine and Russia, as well as the war between Israel and Palestine, which have resulted in numerous casualties and injuries,"" Zhu noted.What does 300,000 victims mean? It means that during the six-week human catastrophe, on average, every 12 seconds, a China citizen was killed. The victims were fathers, mothers, husbands, wives, children, or entire families, the former curator said. As of December 1, 12 survivors of the Nanjing Massacre died this year, and only 38 registered survivors of the Nanjing Massacre remain, according to Fujian Daily. ""With the establishment of the national memorial day, more and more people have begun to help Nanjing restore the jigsaw puzzle of historical facts,"" Zhou Feng, the current curator of the Memorial Hall of the Victims in Nanjing Massacre by Japanese Invaders, said. This year, the museum has collected 1,103 pieces (sets) of cultural relics and historical materials, including a ""Military Diary"" by the Japanese invaders, and a batch of original US newspapers published during the Nanjing Massacre.",CHINA,SOCIETY,"A memorial ceremony is held to mourn the 300,000 victims of the Nanjing Massacre at the Memorial Hall of the Victims in Nanjing Massacre by Japanese Invaders in Nanjing, East China's Jiangsu Province, on December 13, 2023.

241,Vietnam won't allow other countries to exploit it for anti-China purpose: Vietnamese scholar,Global Times,2023-12-12,"Editor's Note:Xi Jinping, general secretary of the CPC Central Committee and China president, is on a state visit to Vietnam from Tuesday to Wednesday at the invitation of the Vietnamese side. Six years after his last Vietnam trip, what significance does Xi Jinping's visit to Vietnam hold this time? Against the backdrop of the China-US competition, how should Vietnam position itself as well as its relationship with the two major powers? Nguyen Tang Nghi (Nghi), vice dean of the Faculty of International Relations at Vietnam National University of Ho Chi Minh City, shared his views with Global Times (Global Times) reporter Li Aixin.Global Times: President Xi Jinping is currently visiting Vietnam, where both sides will explore a ""new positioning"" and ""new level"" of China-Vietnam relations. What are your expectations for this new positioning? In your view, what significance does an elevation of bilateral relations hold?Nghi: In today's world, numerous issues require reflection and concern, ranging from the Russia-Ukraine conflict, the war in the Gaza, the global economic recession, to the strategic competition between China and the US. These issues inevitably impact the thoughts, attitudes and diplomatic policies of every nation. China-Vietnam relations will also face challenges stemming from these global concerns. Therefore, President Xi Jinping's visit, apart from consolidating and strengthening the comprehensive and multifaceted relationship between the two countries, requires timely policy adjustments from both leaders to align with global and regional trends.Xi Jinping's state visit underscores the high importance both Vietnam and China attach to their special relationship. The visit is expected to deepen cooperation and development in various areas, including politics, security, as well as infrastructure and trade. Subsequently, it is expected to affirm and solidify the strong trust between the two parties, the two countries and the two peoples. I look forward to more concrete and in-depth cooperation in areas such as infrastructure and transportation arising from this visit, laying a solid foundation for the future development and elevation of bilateral relations.Global Times: In recent years, leaders of both countries have often emphasized that China and Vietnam share a traditional friendship featuring ""camaraderie plus brotherhood."" How do you interpret and feel about this expression in the context of China-Vietnam relations?Nghi: The comradeship in the concept of ""camaraderie plus brotherhood"" embodies the ""party ties"" of the bilateral relationship. Both Vietnam and China are socialist countries with similar ideologies, acknowledging the leadership role of the communist party. The addition of the term ""brothers"" in the current context signifies a mutual determination to draw each other closer amid a world marked by divisions and excessive polarizations. This expression also suggests that there is a need from both sides for more goodwill and sincerity in cooperation and the resolution of differences. As brothers, we should address and resolve our frictions candidly. Additionally, both countries need to treat each other candidly in the fields of cooperation and development, supporting each other and jointly addressing new issues in the region and the world.Global Times: In the field of China-Vietnam economic and trade cooperation, what do you think is the next area of focus and which area has the most potential? Nghi: There is significant room for the development of China-Vietnam relations. China is a powerhouse in technology, digital transformation and artificial intelligence. Furthermore, China is regarded as a leading country in terms of providing support and investment for the development of industries and infrastructure on a global scale. Therefore, in the foreseeable future, these will be potential areas in which both China and Vietnam can mutually drive and collaborate. China possesses experience, capabilities and influence in these areas, while Vietnam genuinely needs China's support to facilitate its economic and social development.In addition to this, if China can effectively support and promote Vietnam's development, there is a strong possibility China will further penetrate the ASEAN market, given Vietnam's increasing role among Southeast Asian nations.

Nguyen Tang Nghi Photo: Courtesy of NghiGT: Some observers worry that against the backdrop of the competition with China, the US is using Vietnam as a pawn in its Indo-Pacific Strategy. Do you share these concerns? How do you think Vietnam should avoid being exploited by the US?Nghi: Vietnam's 2019 National Defense White Paper clearly articulates the spirit of the ""Four Nos"" policy: no partaking in military alliances, no siding with one country to act against another, no foreign military bases in the Vietnamese territory or using Vietnam as leverage to counteract other countries, and no using force or threatening to use force in international relations.Vietnam prioritizes its national interests. I believe the claims that Vietnam is aligning with the US to confront China are unfounded and lack credibility. Vietnam will not ally with the US to confront any country, including China. Furthermore, the well-established multifaceted relationship between Vietnam and China has been nurtured and developed by leaders from both countries over multiple generations. Vietnam has no reason to form alliances with third parties to counter China, nor does it have a reason to allow other countries to exploit Vietnam for anti-China purposes. The prosperity and stability of Vietnam-China relations hold special significance for the two parties and their peoples. Global Times: During China Foreign Minister Wang Yi's recent visit to Vietnam, both sides expressed their commitments to jointly making the South China Sea a sea of peace and cooperation. How do you evaluate the efforts of both sides in this regard? What is the significance of maintaining stability in the South China Sea?Nghi: As I mentioned earlier, the term ""camaraderie plus brotherhood"" holds significant meaning in addressing the cognitive differences between the two sides over the South China Sea issue. As two brotherly nations, Vietnam and China need to approach the resolution of the South China Sea issue with more sincerity and candor. Both sides must respect the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea adopted in 1982 while simultaneously establishing peace, friendship and cooperation in the South China Sea. This issue affects the security and development of both countries, the region and the world. Both nations need to have greater sincerity and willingness to work together to address prominent issues, contributing to maintaining peace and creating an environment for the economic, social and security development of all parties.Global Times: You used to study at Renmin University of China (RUC). During your time in China, what left the deepest impression on you?Nghi: The spirit of the China people left a deep and positive impression on me. I spent four years pursuing my PhD at RUC. During that time, I received careful guidance and care from my professor and colleagues. I appreciate and cherish the years of study and research at RUC. I have always believed that China was a place that helped me grow in studying, research and future development.Moreover, during my time in China, I visited many places and made numerous China friends and acquaintances. The time I spent in China allowed me to experience the warmth and hospitality of the China friends I met, as well as their willingness to help and support me. I always found the China people to be genuinely united and kind. They exhibit a proactive attitude in all aspects of work. I believe that, in addition to correct policies, the unity and spirit of the China nation have contributed significantly to shaping and building today's China. Global Times: In August, you visited China for academic exchanges. Can you introduce this exchange with the China scholars?Nghi: In August, I led 168 undergraduate students and six professors from the College of Social Sciences and Humanities at Vietnam National University of Ho Chi Minh City to visit Fudan University and Shanghai International Studies University for academic exchanges. This trip provided Vietnamese students with an opportunity to study and experience China's development achievements. This will contribute to enhancing mutual understanding between the two nations' youth. Moreover, visiting prestigious China universities like Fudan University motivates our undergraduate students to have more enthusiasm for study and research. In particular, the seminars and lectures at these China universities have allowed our students to gain a better understanding and experience of China's diplomatic policies and strategies in the new era.",OPINION,ASIAN REVIEW,"A view of Hanoi, capital city of Vietnam Photo: VCG",Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'Xi Jinping': ('PER', 5), 'Nguyen Tang Nghi': ('PER', 2), 'Li Aixin': ('PER', 1), 'Ng': ('PER', 2), 'CPC Central Committee': ('ORG', 1), 'Faculty of International Relations': ('ORG', 1), 'Vietnam National University': ('ORG', 1), 'Ho Chi': ('ORG', 1), 'Global Times': ('ORG', 3), 'China': ('LOC', 8), 'Vietnam': ('LOC', 10), 'US': ('LOC', 2), 'Minh City': ('LOC', 1), 'Russia': ('LOC', 1), 'Ukraine': ('LOC', 1), 'Gaza': ('LOC', 1), 'Vietnamese': ('MISC', 1)}"
242,Zelensky finds greater difficulties in lobbying aid in his third Washington visit,GT staff reporters,2023-12-12,"From a hero's welcome in the US Capitol in 2022 to facing a now bitterly divided Congress, Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky has found himself in increasing difficulties in lobbying Washington. Such a sharp shift in attitudes in the US has exposed that the true nature of the so-called commitment to Ukraine has always been US-centric, other than caring for the Ukraine people, analysts said on Tuesday.According to the Associated Press (AP,) Zelensky, who kicked off his quick visit to Washington on Monday, issued a personal plea for Congress to break its deadlock and approve continued support for Ukraine. This is Zelensky's third visit to Washington since the war in Ukraine began, and comes at a critical moment in congressional negotiations for emergency aid to Kiev. Congress appears no closer to a deal tying immigration and border policy changes to the emergency aid package that will provide funding for Ukraine and Israel before lawmakers leave town for the holidays, CNN reported.Cui Heng, an assistant research fellow at the Center for Russia Studies at East China Normal University, told the Global Times on Tuesday that Zelensky was hailed as a hero by the West in 2022, not because of his personal excellence, but ""because the West needed Zelensky to exhaust Russia at the expense of the Ukraine people."" ""The nearly two-year Russia-Ukraine conflict did not bring down Russia as the West had hoped. Instead, high inflation caused by the conflict has brought great suffering to West people, and opposition to aid for Ukraine is growing stronger in West countries,"" Cui said. Nearly half of US voters think the US is spending too much on aid for Ukraine, according to the latest FT-Michigan Ross monthly poll that underscores the fragility of domestic support, according to media report on Monday. ""This public opinion against the backdrop of the US elections puts tremendous pressure on both parties. This is why Joe Biden is tightening his stance on aid to Ukraine and Congress is making trouble in the Ukraine aid bill,"" Cui said. Russia on Friday accused the US of making ""billions of dollars"" at the expense of ordinary Ukraine citizens' lives, urging Kiev to understand that US are always concerned with themselves. ""Ukraine must understand that it is not the main concern of the US. The main concern for the US has always been the US themselves. And even at the cost of a large number of lives of those same Ukrainians,"" Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said at a press briefing in Moscow.""Zelensky has become deeply involved in the domestic partisan struggle in the US, which is not good for him. This means that many Republican would oppose continued US assistance to Ukraine, precisely because Zelensky stands too closely with the White House,"" Li Haidong, a professor at the China Foreign Affairs University, told the Global Times on Tuesday. The difficulty in resolving the Ukraine issue, to some extent, aligns with the domestic political agenda of the Republican. It is an optimal diplomatic issue for Republican to manipulate to embarrass the White House and the Democrats. We can see how toxic this process is to overall US foreign policy decisions, Li said, noting that ""being friend with the US carries risks, something Ukraine should be realizing now.""Observers noted that from the event where senior US state department official Victoria Nuland handed out cookies to protesters in central Kiev amid a color revolution in December of 2013, to the current war in Ukraine, they all prove that the US bears the biggest responsibilities of the Ukraine crisis both at home and abroad.  US' intervention in Ukraine's internal affairs has led to the country being engulfed in war and potentially facing territorial division. Becoming partner or ally with the US is highly risky, which Ukraine's political elites lack basic understanding and recognition, Li said.",CHINA,DIPLOMACY,"Ukrainian soldiers prepare to fire US-made ""M109"" self-propelled howitzer on the frontline in Donetsk Oblast, Ukraine on February 17, 2023.

243,UNGA to vote on resolution for cease-fire in Gaza after US' veto,Yang Sheng,2023-12-12,"The UN is set to vote on a resolution for an immediate humanitarian cease-fire on Tuesday afternoon local time, after the US vetoed a similar resolution on Friday. Experts said that even if the General Assembly passes a nonbinding resolution, the conflict would not stop because Washington, the only major power that is able to effectively restrain Israel forces from worsening humanitarian situation in Gaza, prefers to clear the way for Israel to realize its ultimate goal rather than protecting lives.After the US vetoed a resolution in the UN on Friday, Saudi Arabia and Islamic nations called for an emergency session of the 193-member General Assembly on Tuesday. Unlike UN resolutions, General Assembly resolutions are not legally binding. But as UN spokesperson Stephane Dujarric said on Monday, the assembly's messages ""are also very important"" and reflect world opinion, the Associated Press reported.Riyad Mansour, Palestine ambassador to the UN, told AP on Sunday that the defeated resolution in the UN was cosponsored by 103 countries, and he is hoping for more cosponsors and a high vote for the General Assembly resolution on Tuesday.In the vote on Friday at the UN, among the 15 members, 13 of them voted in favor of a brief draft resolution, put forward by the United Saudi Arabia Emirates, while Britain abstained and the US vetoed it. This proves that Washington does not care about diplomatic isolation or criticism from within the US or around the globe, and unfortunately, the reality is that apart from criticism and sending humanitarian aid, the UN's role has reached its limit, said China experts.Ma Xiaolin, dean of the Institute for Studies on the Mediterranean Rim at Zhejiang International Studies University, told the Global Times on Tuesday that ""even if the US abstains and lets the resolution pass, if Israel refuses to execute it, and Washington refuses to sanction Israel and maintains its military and economic support, a UN cease-fire resolution would still be useless.""However, China, as a permanent member of the UN and a responsible major power, is still making efforts for peace and humanitarian issues in Gaza. Representatives of a dozen UN members, except the US and France, on Monday made a trip to the Rafah crossing, the only border crossing between Gaza and Egypt.Zhang Jun, China's permanent representative to the UN, joined ambassadors from other UN members on the visit organized by the United Saudi Arabia Emirates, aiming to assess the humanitarian situation and challenges faced by the Palestine people, media reported.Zhang said that China has been ""making unremitting efforts to end the Palestinian-Israeli Conflict conflict at an early date and has provided urgent humanitarian assistance to the Palestine side.""China will continue to urge the UN to play a responsible role in making the realization of a cease-fire a matter of the utmost urgency on the one hand while promoting the expansion of humanitarian access on the other, so as to alleviate the suffering endured by the Palestine people, he said.The Health Ministry in Gaza announced on Monday that the Palestine death toll in the Gaza has exceeded 18,000 as a result of the conflict since October 7, the Xinhua reported. As of Monday, a total of 18,205 Palestine have been killed and 49,645 others wounded in the conflict, according to the ministry's spokesperson Ashraf al-Qedra.If Israel's operation continues, with military advantages and firm US support, it might be possible to see Israel claiming ""victory"" and ending its operation in the coming months, but this would not put an end to the crisis, experts said.Liu Zhongmin, a professor at the Middle East Studies Institute of Shanghai International Studies University, told the Global Times on Tuesday that although it seems like Israel is currently controlling more and more areas of Gaza, if it has to occupy the whole Gaza, then the real challenges will occur.""In order to realize its goal to eliminate Hamas in Gaza, or totally disable the governance of Hamas in the region, Israel must take over the governance and rebuild the region based on Israel's preferences, and in order to realize this plan, it has to cooperate with local Palestine and other Palestine in the West Bank, and [do that] after killing 18,000, or more, of them during this war. Everyone can see how hard it would be,"" Liu said.",CHINA,DIPLOMACY,"People check the damage caused by an Israeli strike at the al-Mughazi refugee camp in Deir Balah of the central Gaza Strip on Nov. 5, 2023.

244,"2023 Yearender: China's diplomacy sees proactivity, success in 2023: former Slovenian president",Global Times,2023-12-11,"Editor's Note: In 2023, the world continues to witness significant changes and turbulence. As we approach 2024, we conducted in-depth interviews with leading strategists from various countries and regions to gather their perspectives on the prominent global issues of 2023 and China's role in addressing them.In the first piece of the series, Danilo Türk (Türk), former president of Slovenia and President of World Leadership Alliance-Club de Madrid, shared his thoughts on topics including China's major diplomatic achievements in 2023 and China-EU Union (EU) relations with Global Times (Global Times) reporter Xia Wenxin at the recent 2023 Imperial Springs International Forum in Guangzhou, capital of South China's Guangdong Province.Global Times: Looking back at 2023, what diplomatic achievements of China have impressed you the most?Türk: This year was very active for China. It started with a paper stating its position on the political settlement of the Ukraine crisis in February, which was a very good and valuable document. We have to understand that in the West, this paper was criticized for not being sufficiently specific, but there is something that the critics didn't understand. That was not meant to be a peace plan, but a conceptual framework within which a proper peace plan can be developed gradually.And then China [this year] was active on the Middle East issue. For example, it helped to bring together an important movement in March between Iran and Saudi Arabia. In June, while receiving the visiting Palestine president, China President Xi Jinping reemphasized the principle of the two-state solution, something that people didn't really notice at the time, but something that has subsequently become quite central. Now, when one talks about Gaza, one has to know that the political solution is the only solution that is necessary. Everything else is just temporary. The solution would require a full state of sovereignty for Palestine as well as full membership in the UN (UN). In the meantime, we have seen that during China's presidency in November, the UN first enabled the adoption of a resolution on Gaza. It was not a very strong resolution, but still, it was the first step.So, if we look at the year 2023, we can see that China was not only very active, but also very successful. Many things are not yet final, but in diplomacy, you don't come to the finality with haste. Being persistent is key, and I believe that the avenues that China opened are healthy and will lead to success.Global Times: What event do you predict to be a ""black swan"" or ""grey rhino"" in 2024?Türk: Wars are never inevitable. Wars happen because people decide to go to war. I think that 2023 was also a very stark reminder that wars are something terrible and should be avoided. I wouldn't want to see any ""black swans,"" and I don't think that ""black swans"" will be seen in 2024.Our fingers are crossed, but we also need to be active in moving toward that direction. I believe that there will be a lot of work necessary now to deal with Ukraine and the Middle East and that the meetings that President Xi Jinping had with President Joe Biden in Bali last year and in San Francisco this year, have created a sufficiently strong base of confidence that the bilateral relations between the two superpowers will be stable. And that would also bring stability to Asia. 

Danilo Türk Photo: Xia Wenxin/GTGT: How have the three global initiatives proposed by China - namely the Global Development Initiative, Global Security Initiative and Global Civilization Initiative - contributed to global governance? Türk: I think that these three initiatives are very helpful because they laid out a kind of a general platform that was conducive. The Foreign Ministry of China published a document on global governance based on these three initiatives in September 2023, which is a very precise and very sophisticated diplomatic document. I see that this was done by very competent people who know exactly how to translate President Xi Jinping's general idea and direction into specific proposals for the international partners and the UN. The UN will hold the Summit of the Future in September 2024, and the China paper published in September is something that can really help a lot. And I think it would be good to revisit and reaffirm the basic ideas of the three initiatives regularly.Global Times: China and the EU just held a bilateral summit in Beijing last week. How do you view the current development of China-EU relations?Türk: I think that China-EU relations require the utmost attention and very serious consideration. There are certain elements of that relationship which will have to be dealt with in a very practical sense, for example, the balance of trade. China exports much more than it imports, and that's not necessarily China's fault, but it is in the interest of both sides to have a reasonable degree of balance. The other thing would be the measures that constitute further reform and opening-up in China. Some of us who are traveling in China these days see very interesting things happening. For example, President Xi Jinping recently spoke about improving legal services and the protection of intellectual property, which are very important issues for investors. So the second question would be: How much progress has been made to improve the investment climate in China and EU? These are the kinds of things which will have to be addressed.And then there are political issues. And here I would hope that the EU will understand the role of China today. China can be a very helpful partner to the EU, and together, they could do many good things. Over the past few years, this realization did not get enough understanding in the EU. There was a time in not distant history when the two sides really worked very closely and on very specific projects. We don't have that now.I think it would help if EU would come closer to China on the issue of the Middle East. For example, if China and the EU coordinate their moves and diplomatic activities with regard to the Palestine question, that would be a major contribution. On Ukraine, I don't think that much new is needed, because China is already participating in this collective effort to figure out the way toward peace, and I don't see much space for immediate innovation. But I think now, one of the political things would be: Can China and the EU work more closely together for peace in the Middle East? That would be interesting.Global Times: What is the significance of the stability of China-EU relations for both sides and the world?Türk: I think it's vital for all these three parties because the EU should understand that China is a factor of stability in the world and one has to proceed from that perspective. China has no need to destabilize anything or anybody and the EU should recognize and respect this fact. Therefore, I think the objective conditions for partnership exist, but they are not always articulated in terms of actual political positions. That's still something that requires further work on both sides. There has to be more dialogue. But ideally, the level of understanding should progress to the point at which each side understands that the other side is a factor of global stability. And therefore, they have to work together to improve global stability. This is not too general. This is actually a very pressing need today.Global Times: What lies in the EU's future cooperation with China?Türk: I think that the EU is a project in the making. The EU was not established as a political entity, it was established as a customs union - in other words, as an economic project. Bringing into that project certain political priorities, some of which are fundamental and serious, is not an easy job. The EU has difficulties in developing a common position on many things. It does not have political processes sufficiently well-designed to be able to produce really adequate responses at any time. This must be understood and appreciated.I think that the level of policy-making in the EU should be improved and China can help as a valuable partner in many places. For example, both China and the EU have vast interests in strengthening the UN. If there was a very serious joint conference based on the China paper on global governance from September this year, it could help both sides to develop their policies to a point of a proposal that can really make the Pact for the Future meaningful next year.",OPINION,VIEWPOINT,A view of Beijing Photo: VCG,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'China': ('LOC', 9), 'Slovenia': ('LOC', 1), 'Guangzhou': ('LOC', 1), 'South China': ('LOC', 10), 'Guangdong Province': ('LOC', 1), 'Ukraine': ('LOC', 1), 'West': ('LOC', 1), 'Middle East': ('LOC', 1), 'Iran': ('LOC', 1), 'Saudi Arabia': ('LOC', 1), 'Palestine': ('LOC', 2), 'Gaza': ('LOC', 2), 'Danilo Türk': ('PER', 2), 'Xia Wenxin': ('PER', 1), 'Tü': ('PER', 1), 'Xi Jinping': ('PER', 1), 'World Leadership Alliance': ('ORG', 1), 'Club de Madrid': ('ORG', 1), 'EU Union': ('ORG', 2), 'Global Times': ('ORG', 3), 'UN': ('ORG', 3), 'Imperial Springs International Forum': ('MISC', 1)}"
245,"Washington adds fuel to the fire in Gaza with veto in UN, provision of weapons",Wang Jin,2023-12-11,"On Friday, a resolution put forward by the United Saudi Arabia Emirates calling for an immediate humanitarian cease-fire in Gaza failed to pass in a vote at the UN. The US, as a permanent member of the UN, used its veto power. This is the second time, after October 18, that the US has been the only opposing vote on such a resolution.In addition, another decision made by the US has been questioned by the international community: According to the Pentagon on Saturday, the Joe Biden administration used an emergency authority and skipped the congressional review to approve the sale of about 14,000 tank shells to Israel. It can be said that the veto of the US and the provision of armaments to Israel at this critical moment are undoubtedly adding fuel to the fire during the Palestine-Israel conflict.Currently, the US speaks one way and thinks another. For fear that its strategic layout in the Middle East would be destroyed, the US hopes to limit Israel's military strikes. Meanwhile, it seems that the US is also ""actively"" exerting diplomatic pressure on the Israel side to stop its military operations to avoid the escalation of the humanitarian crisis in Gaza.The US claims it supports peace in the Middle East, but its actions are further fueling the conflict in Gaza. The US has provided Israel with a great deal of assistance since the outbreak of the conflict, including the White House's request to provide Israel with $14 billion in aid for its air and missile defenses.In fact, the world is not surprised that the US has continuously provided military assistance to Israel. There is a close military cooperation between the US and Israel. The signing of a memorandum of understanding (MoU) between the two countries in 1965 marked the beginning of their strategic relationship. In 1981, a new MoU was signed on strategic cooperation between the two sides. Since the recent outbreak of conflict in Gaza, the US has organized a large-scale supply to Israel, with weapons such as the Iron Dome air-defense system and precision-guided bomb equipment transferred to it.More importantly, the US is not only shirking its responsibility to promote peace and end the war, but is also evading its obligations in humanitarian assistance and peace talks.The US veto over a resolution at this critical moment has caused a serious setback to the international community's efforts to promote a cease-fire between Palestine and Israel, leading the situation in the Middle East to an even more volatile and dangerous level.The resolutions proposed by the UN, the most authoritative and influential international platform, can represent the voices of the international community and should exert influence on the realization of a cease-fire between the Palestine and Israel sides. 13 of the 15 UN members supported the resolution in the vote, while the UK abstained. But the US was the only country that cast a veto, thus making a unanimous resolution impossible, and seriously disrupting the call for fairness and justice by the international community on the Israel-Palestine issue. Currently, the stability of the Middle East faces new challenges. On one hand, the ongoing Palestine-Israel conflict has exacerbated the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. After the outbreak of the conflict, the displacement of a massive population in a short period of time has not only upset the economic equilibrium, but also paralyzed the relief mechanisms there. Although the international community has organized multiple rounds of aid, the intense fighting has caused great difficulties in maintaining humanitarian assistance.On the other hand, since the new round of the Israel-Palestine conflict, armed groups in Lebanon, Syria and Iraq have attacked Israel and US targets. The situation in the region has been shrouded in tension and crisis, with protests and demonstrations taking place in Jordan, Egypt and other countries, posing a great risk to the domestic political stability of these countries. As the root cause of the conflict in the Middle East, as long as the Palestine-Israel cease-fire cannot be achieved, the regional countries and the international community will face the risk of continued spillover effects from the conflict. The author is an associate professor at the Institute of Middle Eastern Studies of Northwest University. opinion@globaltimes.com.cn",OPINION,VIEWPOINT,Illustration: Liu Rui/GT,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'United Saudi Arabia Emirates': ('LOC', 1), 'Gaza': ('LOC', 4), 'US': ('LOC', 14), 'Israel': ('LOC', 11), 'Middle East': ('LOC', 3), 'White House': ('LOC', 1), 'UN': ('ORG', 3), 'Pentagon': ('ORG', 1), 'Joe Biden': ('PER', 1), 'Palestine': ('MISC', 2), 'Mo': ('MISC', 2)}"
246,"US, EU should mind own business on human rights issues: Chinese FM",Global Times,2023-12-11,"Foreign countries have no rights or are in no position to meddle in China's human rights situation, the China Foreign Ministry stated on Monday, emphasizing that those countries should reflect on themselves and stop politicizing and instrumentalizing human rights issues.The remarks were made by foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning during a regular press conference on Monday, after the EU Delegation in China released a statement on Sunday, in which the EU ""reiterates its concerns"" about the human rights situation in China.Mao noted that holds a people-centered approach and has scored historic achievements in protecting human rights. Xinjiang and Xizang have long enjoyed booming economy, harmonious and stable society, and effective protection and promotion of cultural heritage. The rights and freedoms of all ethnic groups, including the freedom of religious belief and the freedom to use and develop their ethnic groups' spoken and written languages, are fully protected.Facts have long disproved the so-called ""genocide"" and ""forced labor"" as egregious lies. The human rights conditions there are at their historical best, as recognized by the international community, said Mao.Mao urged the EU to recognize China's progress in the human rights cause, put down arrogance and bias, abandon the hypocritical double standards, take concrete action to improve its own human rights conditions, stop using human rights as a pretext to interfere in China's internal affairs and judicial sovereignty, and stop politicizing, instrumentalizing and weaponizing human rights issues.China experts also warned EU against following the US in weaponizing claims of ""forced labor,"" after Volkswagen's announcement that no evidence of forced labor was found in its supply chain in Xinjiang region.According to Mao, while pointing fingers at developing countries' human rights conditions over the years, the EU is in fact experiencing worrying human rights conditions in itself. Recent years have seen in EU countries infringement of the rights of refugees and migrants, rising exclusivism and racism, negligence over economic, social and cultural rights and the right to development, and selective application and double standards on issues such as freedom of press and forced labor. UN High Commissioner for Human Rights pointed out that some EU countries are backsliding on fundamental human rights commitments, Mao added.The spokesperson also pointed to the US, after the country on Friday announced new sanctions against two China officials for ""serious human rights abuses"" against Uygur people in Xinjiang, and also blocked imports from three additional China companies due to allegations of forced labor.The US has no right and is in no position to point fingers at the human rights situation in Xinjiang. The so-called ""genocide"" and ""forced labor"" are nothing but the biggest lie of the century spread by the US with the aim to contain and suppress China and has long been exposed in front of facts and truths, Mao said.The US is fraught with domestic human rights issues and it has a quite notorious international human rights record. If the US truly cared about human rights, it needs to earnestly address its domestic problems such as racial discrimination, gun violence and drug abuse. The last thing it should do is to veto the UN resolution calling for a humanitarian ceasefire, the only country that has done so, while the humanitarian disaster in Gaza deteriorates by the hour, Mao said.Global Times",CHINA,DIPLOMACY,Mao Ning profile photo Photo: official website of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'China': ('LOC', 8), 'Xinjiang': ('LOC', 2), 'Xizang': ('LOC', 1), 'US': ('LOC', 2), 'Xi': ('LOC', 1), 'Foreign Ministry': ('ORG', 1), 'EU Del': ('ORG', 7), 'Volkswagen': ('ORG', 1), 'UN': ('ORG', 1), 'Mao Ning': ('PER', 6)}"
247,Zelensky's visit 'might not be able to break deadlock' in US Congress over aid,Yang Sheng,2023-12-11,"Although US President Joe Biden has invited Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky to visit the US, a move that is believed to help the Joe Biden administration break the deadlock in Congress over aid to allow Ukraine to keep up its fight with Russia, analysts said serious partisan struggles between Democrats and Republican, as well as the ongoing conflict in Gaza, could make it very difficult for Zelensky to get what he wants during this trip.Ukraine's setback in the war would affect Joe Biden in the 2024 election, and this is a key element that is making Republican determined to add problems to the latest Ukraine aid deal in Congress, and if the US significantly reduces the amount of aid, more and more NATO members, especially those in EU, will have a pretext to reduce their aid as well, and this would make the situation increasingly favorable to Russia. But before the US presidential election, which will be concluded late next year, it's still hard to see an end to the conflict.Trying to break the deadlockZelensky's visit to the US this time, which the White House announced Sunday, is his third to Washington since the war in Ukraine began, and comes at a critical moment in congressional negotiations for emergency aid to Ukraine. Congress appears no closer to a deal tying immigration and border policy changes to the emergency aid package that will provide funding for Ukraine and Israel before lawmakers leave town for the holidays, CNN reported.Apart from meeting with Joe Biden, Zelensky will also meet with some congressional leaders on Tuesday. Senate Majority Leader Charles Schumer of the Democrats and Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of the Republican invited Zelensky to speak to senators Tuesday morning, according to a Senate leadership aide. House Speaker Mike Johnson of the Republican will also meet with Zelensky, according to the speaker's spokesman Raj Shah, the Washington Post reported on Sunday.China experts said that if Ukraine forces lose a large amount of support from the US in terms of weapons and money, it will be very difficult for Kiev to keep up its fight, and the reason why Joe Biden has invited Zelensky to visit Washington at this time is that the US president finds himself unable to convince congress members to cooperate on the aid deal, and wants Zelensky to help him, while Zelensky is also helping himself.In this case, Joe Biden and Zelensky share the same goal, because if Zelensky fails to get aid, leading to more failures on the battlefield, it would be a humiliation for the Joe Biden administration. However, Republican, who have a key role in passing the aid deal, do not share the same goal as Zelensky, as they and their voters believe that US have more important issues to deal with, and Ukraine is getting too much money from the US. Republican want to see the Joe Biden administration and Democrats lose in 2024, which is why Zelensky is unlikely to convince Republican, said analysts. According to the Pew Research Center, a new poll that the institute conducted from November 27 to December 3, covering 5,203 US, showed that 31 percent of US say ""the US is providing too much assistance to Ukraine"" in its fight against Russia, while 29 percent say that ""the US is providing the right amount of support,"" and only 18 percent say ""the US is not providing enough."" This means about 60 percent US believe that there should be no more aid to Ukraine, which has given Republican confidence to block the deal in Congress, experts noted. The Washington Post said in its report on Sunday that ""the key hurdle for more Ukraine funding is in the Republican-controlled House of Representatives,"" where Zelensky has not yet been invited to speak with House Republican.Cui Heng, an assistant research fellow from the Center for Russia Studies of East China Normal University, told the Global Times on Monday that ""this is the most difficult moment for Ukraine since the outbreak of the Ukraine crisis. The difficulty is not about defending against attacks from Russia, but about preventing being 'abandoned' by the US-led West.""Change in the battlefieldAs Zelensky and Joe Biden battled problems over the aid deal, Russia released some information about its victories on the battlefield. RT reported on Sunday that ""Russia forces have unfurled the country's flag on the outskirts of Maryinka,"" a key town in Donetsk, and a major Ukraine stronghold.Reuters reported on December 2 that Ukraine's control over Maryinka remained uncertain, ""with unofficial reports suggesting Russia forces had registered some gains.""Song Zhongping, a China military expert and TV commentator, told the Global Times on Monday that ""Russia is surely getting the advantage in the battlefield. Russia would be able to expand its advantage if Ukraine is unable to get more aid from the West to pay for its hard fight with Russia."" US aid is crucial to Ukraine, because Washington's decision will affect other West countries, and if the US aid is significantly reduced or stopped, other West countries will definitely reduce their aid as well, and this will be a major setback for Kiev, but good news for Moscow, Song noted.   In the next stage, observing what EU countries will do is key, Cui said. Although many EU countries have promised that they will maintain their support for Ukraine, they all have to deal with domestic pressures, and if Republican cut the US' aid successfully, more and more EU right-wing conservative forces will follow, Cui noted.In the first quarter of 2024, there might not be any significant change in the Russia-Ukraine conflict, as only the Russia and US presidential elections will have an impact on the ongoing conflict, experts said.",CHINA,DIPLOMACY,"Smoke rises above the area of the frontline town of Avdiivka, Ukraine on October 18, 2023.

248,"China's international marine shipping affected by disruption from major canals, cost surge among delays",GT staff reporters,2023-12-10,"China's marine shipping for exports to the EU and the US has been affected by the disruption of two prominent global canals - the Panama Canal and the Suez Canal - due to drought and geopolitical factors, leading to a surge in shipping costs and delivery delays, China industry insiders told the Global Times on Sunday. Yemen's Houthi movement said on Saturday that it would target all ships heading to Israel, regardless of nationality, and warned all international shipping companies against dealing with Israel ports, Reuters reported. Due to the ongoing Israel-Palestine conflict, many cargo ships have chosen to bypass the Suez Canal, which is a crucial shipping route connecting China with the EU market. The straight-line distance from the Suez Canal to the Gaza is less than 200 kilometers, domestic futures news site qhrb.com reported. The Panama Canal, another trade route carrying many of China's commodities to the US market, is suffering its worst-ever drought, according to a report by the Daily Mail on Thursday. The report said that dozens of massive container ships carrying presents and festive items for Christmas including Apple's new iPhones, TVs, exercise bikes, clothes and tree lights are experiencing delays of up to four weeks. Shipping companies have been dealing with delivery delays and additional costs resulting from the disruption of the two canals, Wu Minghua, a veteran shipping analyst, told the Global Times on Sunday. For instance, deliveries heading to the US East Coast via the Panama Canal now may be unloaded in ports in Los Angeles, Long Beach and other places on the US West Coast and transferred to the East Coast through land or railway transportation. That means higher transportation expenditures, Wu said. The Panama Canal Authority announced on November 24 that it would offer a special auction slot starting on November 25, with the purpose of providing more opportunities of obtaining a slot for vessels in the Panamax Locks that have been waiting in the transit line for an extended period.China is the second-largest user of the Panama Canal, accounting for 21.4 percent of the canal's total freight volume in the financial year of 2022, stcn.com reported. Additional charges for shipping companies such as the auction fee may be passed on to the shippers, Zheng Ping, chief analyst with industry news portal chineseport.cn, told the Global Times on Sunday. In terms of the Suez Canal, Wu said that shipping companies may increase their insurance coverage.Meanwhile, Wu noted that companies may start shipping preparations even earlier due to the potential delays and changes in routes, as the China New Year in February 2024 will be another peak. For example, if ships bypass the Suez Canal, they would choose routes like the Cape of Good Hope and the journey will take around 10 more days to reach ports in EU. Zheng also noted that external demand from overseas markets such as the US has been weakened because of inflation and interest rate hikes.Official data from China's Ministry of Transport showed that the cargo throughput for foreign trade handled by China's ports reached 4.2 billion tons in the first 10 months of the year.",SOURCE,ECONOMY,A ship loading foreign trade goods at Qingdao Port Fully Automated Container Terminal in East China's Shandong Province on Wednesday.

249,Ousting of UPenn president over 'anti-Semitism' reflects deepening social and value divide in the US: experts,Fan Anqi,2023-12-10,"The surprise ousting of the leader of one of the world's most prestigious universities, following her controversial testimony after a grilling at a congressional hearing, reflects a deepening social as well as values divide in the US, experts said on Sunday. The fundamental way to curb anti-Semitism is not firing university presidents, but for the US government to stop supporting warfare and inhumane acts in the Middle East, they noted. University of Pennsylvania President Liz Magill on Saturday ""voluntarily"" stepped down from her role amid intense pressure from donors and politicians over her testimony about anti-Semitism on Capitol Hill this week, according to media reports.Magill was confronted with waves of criticisms after she appeared with the leaders of Harvard University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in a more than five-hour-long hearing in front of lawmakers on Tuesday, where they were forced to give yes or no answers to an aggressive question of whether ""calling for the genocide of Jews"" would violate the schools' code of conducts.""If the speech turns into conduct it can be harassment, yes,"" Magill said. Pressed further, Magill noted that it is ""a context-dependent decision.""The chairman of the Ivy League school's board of trustees, Scott Bok, who also resigned immediately after Magill's departure, said Magill was unfairly treated, ""worn down by months of relentless external attacks,"" CNN reported. Before Magill's ouster, a bipartisan group of more than 70 members of Congress sent letters to the board members of Penn, Harvard and MIT on Friday demanding the three presidents' removal.Magill's resignation reflects the escalating divide in US society following the latest Palestinian-Israeli Conflict conflict, where two opposing trends - anti-Semitism and Islamophobia - have emerged and cause people to resort to extreme means, Yang Xiyu, a senior research fellow at the China Institute of International Studies, told the Global Times on Sunday.Under such a polarizing political climate, a relatively neutral stance is almost impossible to maintain, nor the balance between the freedom of speech that US higher education has always embraced and the US political correctness, Yang said. What's more, the deepening political division is extending to a fracture in US values, shaking the very foundations of US society, Yang said. This latest episode reflects the significant gap between political elites and the public. When public opinion runs counter to that of the elites, the latter will attempt to exert political pressure to force those with differing views to abandon their right to free expression. This blind faith in power undoubtedly will lead to increased resentment and rebellion against the government and deepen the divide in US society, Li Haidong, a professor at the China Foreign Affairs University, told the Global Times on Sunday.Just as societal turmoil continues to heat up, the US government reaffirmed its support for Israel despite a partisan divide over the issue, as the Joe Biden administration on Friday used an emergency authority to allow the sale of about 14,000 tank shells to Israel without congressional review.The State Department used an Arms Export Control Act emergency declaration for the tank rounds worth $106.5 million for immediate delivery to Israel, the Pentagon said in a statement on Saturday, Al Jazzera reported. ""The US politicians have overlooked the most crucial problem: Why is there a sharp rise in anti-Semitic sentiments? The answer is the US' increasing support of inhumane actions in the Middle East. With thousands of innocent lives burning into ashes every day, the US government keeps prioritizing its own interests rather than upholding justice and humanitarian principles, and this is the fundamental reason,"" Yang told the Global Times. Without addressing this fundamental issue and focusing solely on the surface-level problem of anti-Semitism, it is not only a misplacement of priorities but also a distortion of right and wrong, he said. This will also significantly damage the international image and soft power of the US, not only leading to widespread dissatisfaction among the US public, but also generating strong resentment from the international community, observers noted.",CHINA,DIPLOMACY,"US university students attend a campus protest against ongoing Israeli attacks on Gaza in Washington, D.C., United States on November 01, 2023.Photo: VCG",Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'US': ('LOC', 7), 'Middle East': ('LOC', 1), 'Capitol Hill': ('LOC', 1), 'China': ('LOC', 1), 'anti': ('MISC', 2), 'Semi': ('MISC', 3), 'Jews': ('MISC', 1), 'Ivy League': ('MISC', 1), 'Palestinian - Israeli Conflict': ('MISC', 1), 'Islam': ('MISC', 1), 'University of Pennsylvania': ('ORG', 1), 'Harvard University': ('ORG', 2), 'Massachusetts Institute of Technology': ('ORG', 2), 'MIT': ('ORG', 2), 'CNN': ('ORG', 1), 'Congress': ('ORG', 1), 'Penn': ('ORG', 1), 'Liz Magill': ('PER', 8), 'Scott Bok': ('PER', 1), 'Yang Xi': ('PER', 3)}"
251,"China 'disappointed, regretful' over US veto on UNSC resolution calling for Gaza ceasefire",Zhang Han,2023-12-09,"China expressed deep disappointment and regret over the US' veto of a UN resolution draft calling for a humanitarian ceasefire in Gaza, China Ambassador to UN Zhang Jun said on local time Friday, criticizing the US' hypocrisy and double standards. The UN convened an emergency session during which Secretary-General António Guterres said that there is ""a high risk of the total collapse of the humanitarian support system in Gaza, which would have devastating consequences.""The draft, proposed by countries including the United Saudi Arabia Emirates (UAE), received 13 votes and one abstention from the UK. The only rejection came from the US, a permanent member of the UN with veto power. After the voting, Zhang said the core of the resolution draft proposed by the UAE, on behalf of Saudi Arabia countries, is to call for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire in Gaza and the release of all hostages. This resolution has nearly 100 co-sponsoring countries, including China. We are extremely disappointed and regretful that the resolution was vetoed by the US.The two months of conflict have caused unprecedented death and destruction, and an immediate ceasefire is the prerequisite for everything. On this issue, any negative attitude is untenable, and any justification (of rejection) is feeble, Zhang said. It is contradictory to tolerate the continuation of the conflict while claiming to care about the safety and humanitarian needs of the people in Gaza. It is self-deceptive to advocate preventing the spillover of the conflict while tolerating its continuation. It is extremely hypocritical to tolerate the continuation of the conflict while paying lip service to the protection of human rights and the protection of women and children, Zhang said, ""All of this once again shows us what double standards are."" Zhang stated that although the resolution was vetoed, the strong international calls for a ceasefire, protection of civilians, and prevention of a greater humanitarian disaster will not diminish, and efforts by the UN to uphold justice and fulfil its responsibilities will not stop. We urge Israel to listen to the international community's calls, stop the collective punishment of the people in Gaza, and support further diplomatic mediation to facilitate the early release of all detained individuals. We call on all relevant parties to concentrate all efforts on the common goal of calming the flames of war in Gaza, giving the Palestine people hope for survival, and leaving hope for peace in the Middle East, Zhang said.Since hostilities  escalated in early October, more than 17,000 Palestine have been killed, including more than 4,000 women and 7,000 children. Tens of thousands are reportedly injured, and many are missing, presumably under the rubble, according to Guterres who reported the recent situation in Middle East at the Friday session. ""Attacks from air, land and sea are intense, continuous and widespread. So far, they have reportedly hit 339 education facilities, 26 hospitals, 56 healthcare facilities, 88 mosques and three churches,"" Guterres said.The Secretary-General in a letter to the UN on December 6, made the rare move to invoke the Article 99. It says the UN chief ""may bring to attention of the UN any matter which in his opinion, may threaten the maintenance of international peace and security.""This is the first time Guterres invoked the Article since he took office in 2017. ""The Israel-Palestine conflict has been escalating over the last two months with the humanitarian crisis aggravating despite a short-lived temporary cease-fire. The UN overall has not played its role of promoting peace due to the interference of the US, and its functions have been rendered mute,"" Sun Degang, director of the Center for Middle Eastern Studies at Fudan University, told the Global Times.Analysts urged the US to listen to the joint calls of the international community and expressed the hope that the US can coordinate with China to realize a phased ceasefire to address the unfolding  humanitarian crisis.",CHINA,DIPLOMACY,Photo:CFP,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'China': ('LOC', 3), 'US': ('LOC', 4), 'Gaza': ('LOC', 6), 'United Saudi Arabia Emirates': ('LOC', 1), 'UAE': ('LOC', 2), 'UK': ('LOC', 1), 'Saudi Arabia': ('LOC', 1), 'Israel': ('LOC', 1), 'Palestine': ('LOC', 1), 'Middle East': ('LOC', 1), 'UN': ('ORG', 5), 'Zhang Jun': ('PER', 6), 'António Guterres': ('PER', 1)}"
252,"Xinjiang-related sanctions reflect the US’ double standard, utilitarianism and hegemony",Ma Ruiqian,2023-12-09,"Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Friday announced new sanctions against two China officials for ""serious human rights abuses"" against Uygurs in Xinjiang, as the US also moved to block imports from three additional China companies due to allegations of forced labor. China embassy spokesperson Liu Pengyu said these sanctions were ""illegal"" and ""based on lies,"" Reuters reported.The so-called ""forced labor practices involving Uygurs and other minorities in China"" is a topic frequently hyped by the US over recent years. It serves as the primary pretext for the US to continuously enact Xinjiang-related legislation and implement corresponding sanctions under the guise of a ""legal"" framework. On a deeper level, this aligns with the US strategic shift toward the Asia-Pacific, designating China as an imaginary adversary and comprehensively suppressing China, while simultaneously diverting attention away from US domestic issues and maintaining its global hegemony. The frequent imposition of Xinjiang-related sanctions by the US reflects its mindset and behavior of double standards, utilitarianism, and hegemony, Meng Qingtao, deputy head of the Human Rights Institute at the Southwest University of Political Science and Law, told the Global Times. The US applies double standards both domestically and internationally based on its own interests and ideological criteria, selectively ignoring instances of ""forced labor"" policies and practices within its borders and among its allies. It turns a blind eye to statements from entities like the Volkswagen, which, through external audit firms, declared no sign of ""forced labor"" in its factories in Xinjiang. Instead, the US relies on reports from international human rights organizations as well as fabricated stories from alleged informants, to unilaterally assert the existence of so-called ""forced labor"" in Xinjiang.The US consistently follows a ""utilitarian policy"", which uses sanctions against officials and companies over Xinjiang-related affairs as a means to economically disrupt China's industrial chain, politically negate China's effective governance, and ideologically tarnish and demonize China to impede its peaceful rise.The US has established a global hegemonic system by relying on economic dominance through control of the international monetary system and manipulation of the International Monetary Fund, political dominance through leading the UN system, military dominance through military superiority and NATO expansion, and ideological dominance by exporting US-style freedom, democracy, and human rights. The frequent imposition of Xinjiang-related sanctions has once again exposed the true nature of US hegemony.These sanctions were among a series of actions the US took two days ahead of the 75th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which outlines the basic rights that global citizens should enjoy, including the right to life, liberty, and personal security. Ironically, on the same day, the US vetoed a UN resolution demanding immediate humanitarian ceasefire in Gaza. This disregard for human rights in such actions is, in itself, a betrayal of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. It is unethical, lacks moral boundaries, and exposes the hypocrisy of the US, which has always claimed to care about the human rights of ordinary people, including the right to life, Wang Sha, assistant researcher of Human Rights Institute at the Southwest University of Political Science and Law, told the Global Times.The US abuse of unilateral sanctions and extraterritorial jurisdiction will inevitably have adverse effects on global development. At a time when the world economy faces significant challenges, and China is actively seeking solutions for global economic development through initiatives such as the Belt and Road, the US is not only suppressing China's economy but also hindering both its own domestic, and global economic sustainability.In recent times, the appearance of a seeming easing of tensions and increased cultural and economic exchanges in China-US relations is more of a diversionary tactic by the US - portraying a facade of improved relations while continuing covert actions. Every time the US challenges China's bottom line, it damages the mutual interests of both countries, reinforces misconceptions about China within US society, and subsequently harms the friendship and sentiments between the two nations, continually escalating the risk of confrontation between China and the US.For the US itself, its duplicitous actions will erode its judicial credibility and diplomatic authority on the international stage, reinforce its international image as a hegemon practicing power politics, deepen rifts between allies, and ultimately result in shooting itself in the foot.China has consistently prioritized the fundamental interests of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang, respecting and safeguarding human rights, actively exploring effective measures to combat terrorism and extremism according to law, and achieving significant successes. Actions speak louder than words, and the false narratives surrounding Xinjiang will ultimately be consigned to the trash can of history.The author is a reporter with the Global Times. maruiqian@globaltimes.com.cn",OPINION,VIEWPOINT,Illustration: Liu Rui/GT,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'Antony Blinken': ('PER', 1), 'Liu Pengyu': ('PER', 1), 'Meng Qingtao': ('PER', 1), 'China': ('LOC', 9), 'Xinjiang': ('LOC', 5), 'US': ('LOC', 11), 'Asia': ('LOC', 1), 'Pacific': ('LOC', 1), 'Xi': ('LOC', 1), 'Uyrs': ('MISC', 2), 'International Mon': ('MISC', 1), 'Reuters': ('ORG', 1), 'Human Rights Institute': ('ORG', 1), 'Southwest University of Political Science and Law': ('ORG', 1), 'Global Times': ('ORG', 1), 'Volkswagen': ('ORG', 1), 'UN': ('ORG', 1), 'NATO': ('ORG', 1)}"

257,US aid to Ukraine may decline with fiercer political battles in election period: expert,GT staff reporters,2023-12-08,"While Democrats and Republican in the US Senate are deadlocked over a bill for $110.5 billion in funds for Ukraine, prospects of the US maintaining aid for Ukraine are dim amid fiercer political battles in the election period, analysts said.  Senate Republican voted unanimously on Wednesday to block the bill granting $110.5 billion in funding for Ukraine, Israel, and other security needs in order to press their demands for more control over immigration via the US border with Mexico. US Senate leaders pledged on Thursday to continue trying to reach an agreement to provide billions of dollars in new security aid to Ukraine but with no result, Reuters reported. US President Joe Biden berated the Republican' blocking of the bill as ""stunning"" and dangerous, and warned that this setback in Ukraine aid would be a ""gift"" to Russia, while some US politicians even said the US would be ""responsible for Ukraine's defeat.""The decrease in funding from the US was expected. In terms of partisan interests, the Republican object to continuing to assist Ukraine as it would benefit Joe Biden and the Democratic Party, Cui Heng, an assistant research fellow from the Center for Russia Studies of East China Normal University, told the Global Times.Also, general opposition has grown within the US domestically as there has been no significant progress on the battlefield despite the large amount of funds invested, while various corruption scandals within the Ukraine government have been exposed, said Cui.As the election season approaches, US assistance to Ukraine will continue to decrease, and all international and domestic policies will be assessed and determined in accordance with the interests of each party. There are also growing concerns about why the government is funding the war in Ukraine rather than using the funds to stimulate the economy, analysts said.Following a meeting with UK Foreign Secretary David Cameron on Thursday, US State Secretary Antony Blinken claimed that 90 percent of US investment in Ukraine have actually been spent in the US with manufacturers and have produced employment at home.Aside from the US, EU countries that initially promised significant support for Ukraine have scaled down their support, said Cui, noting that Ukraine has been facing significant difficulties in foreign aid recently.  Data from the Germany-based Kiel Institute's Ukraine aid tracker showed that new military, financial and humanitarian aid pledged to Ukraine between August and October 2023 fell almost 90 percent compared with the same period in 2022, reaching its lowest point since the start of the war in February 2022. In the EU Union, negotiations worth $53 billion for Ukraine over the next four years were dragging on.When the conflict between Russia and Ukraine initially broke out, countries like the US and Germany used the banner of supporting Ukraine against aggression to gain political points domestically and persuade their citizens to support aid. But with the initial enthusiasm fading, they have to face a more realistic struggle domestically and it is almost impossible to continue increasing aid to Ukraine or even maintain the previous level, said Cui. Given that the conflict is at a standstill, the reduction of aid to Ukraine may not have an immediate impact. But the possibility for negotiations may increase, said Cui. Lü Xiang, a research fellow at the China Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times that the failure to pass the aid bill in the US also sends a clear message, leading to a loss of credibility both domestically and internationally.",CHINA,POLITICS,"US President Joe Biden walks with Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky through the colonnade of the White House, in Washington, DC on December 21, 2022.

259,Western governments have not embraced wise policy objectives to promote a cease-fire in Russia-Ukraine conflict: US author,Global Times,2023-12-07," Editor's Note:Almost two years into the war between Russia and Ukraine, war fatigue is becoming gradually prominent in the West. In the US, Ukraine's biggest single-country donor, we have seen uncertainty loom for future aid to Ukraine in recent days. Nevertheless, many in the West still hold the view that the US and other West countries are doing the right thing in this conflict.In an email interview with Global Times (Global Times) reporter Xia Wenxin, Benjamin Netanyahu Abelow (Abelow), the Washington-based author of the book How the West Brought War to Ukraine: Understanding How US and NATO Policies Led to Crisis, War, and the Risk of Nuclear Catastrophe, shared his thoughts on topics, such as the West's role in the Russia-Ukraine conflict, the future of the US' Ukraine aid, and the possibility of a cease-fire in Ukraine. He writes, lectures, and lobbies Congress about nuclear arms policy.Global Times: Your book, How the West Brought War to Ukraine: Understanding How US and NATO Policies Led to Crisis, War, and the Risk of Nuclear Catastrophe, published last year, has been recognized by great minds, including US scholar Noam Chomsky. Can you elaborate on your main argument in the book?Abelow: I wrote this book to correct a widespread West misconception about the causes of the Russia-Ukraine war. West governments and media have persuaded their citizens that Mr. Vladimir Putin invaded because he wished to expand Russia territory - in effect, to reestablish the Soviet Union or the Tsarist empire. The reality is that Vladimir Putin was responding to three interrelated security threats.First, it is the threat of the expansion of NATO to Russia's borders and the increasing integration of Ukraine into West military structures. I do not believe that the US was planning to attack Russia. I think that most US planners viewed their actions as defensive. But they should have looked at things through Russia eyes. They should have asked themselves how they themselves would have reacted if the situation had been reversed. If a Russia military alliance had encircled the US and pressed against its borders, the US might have gone to war, too.Second, the US withdrew from two key nuclear arms control treaties with Russia - the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces (INF) treaty and the Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) treaty. In withdrawing from the INF treaty, the US claimed the right to deploy land-based nuclear missiles in EU directed against Russia. To make matters worse, the ABM systems that the US is placing in Romania and Poland can be modified to launch offensive, nuclear-tipped missiles. In the absence of the ABM and INF treaties, Russia feared that the US might place offensive missiles close to its border, perhaps right in Ukraine, and might be tempted to launch a first strike. Third, in 2014, the US supported groups in Ukraine that replaced a pro-Russia president with a far-right government that was implacably hostile to Russia. As a result of this takeover, a civil war broke out in eastern Ukraine. The US impeded the peaceful resolution of this war. This civil war created instability on Russia's border and endangered pro-Russia Ukrainians who were living in parts of eastern Ukraine.Global Times: In fact, your views in this book don't really fit into the current mainstream narrative of the Russia-Ukraine conflict in the West. How has the dominant West narrative influenced the war in Ukraine?Abelow: The West narrative, that Vladimir Putin was trying to reestablish the Russia empire, has influenced the war in several harmful ways.To begin with, the narrative helped cause the war. If that false narrative had not existed, it is quite likely that the US would have been willing to negotiate about NATO expansion, based on proposals that Vladimir Putin put forward in December 2021. Furthermore, the US probably would have actively worked to resolve the conflict in eastern Ukraine, and to press Ukraine to implement the ""Minsk II"" peace accords. Even if nothing else had been different, the implementation of these peace accords might have prevented the war.Next, once the war started, the false narrative about Russia's motivations led West countries to block a peace settlement between Ukraine and Russia. In fact, a peace treaty was being negotiated between Ukraine and Russia within a few days after Russia launched an offensive against Ukraine. The US and Britain sabotaged these negotiations, and because of the false narrative, the US pressured Ukraine to launch a suicidal counter-offensive, even though the US knew that Ukraine did not have adequate training or weapons to succeed.Many Ukraine and Russia men have died, and the world has been put at risk of nuclear war because the US refused to renounce NATO membership for Ukraine. West leaders claim that their support of Ukraine is humanitarian. In truth, it is promoting conflict and destroying Ukraine. Global Times: Many in the US worry that the conflict between Israel and Hamas will draw attention away from Ukraine and even affect aid to Kiev. What is your take on this?Abelow: The conflict between Israel and Hamas certainly has diverted attention from Ukraine in the media, the Congress, the Joe Biden administration, the Pentagon and among US citizens. At least for now, funding and weapons are being prioritized for Israel, at the expense of Ukraine. My guess is that the Gaza conflict will result in an ongoing loss of US interest in Ukraine.Global Times: You once stated that ""there is only one solution to the ongoing disaster in Ukraine. It is not a good one, but it is the best one available: to immediately press for a cease-fire, followed by a negotiated settlement."" What do you think is the biggest obstacle to a cease-fire between Russia and Ukraine now? Many countries, including China, are calling for a cease-fire, but why does it seem that there aren't many such voices from the West?Abelow: I believe that the biggest obstacles to a cease-fire in Ukraine are the US policy elite and the far-right neo-fascists in Ukraine. The peace frameworks that China and other countries have put forward have made a great deal of sense. It is disappointing to me that the West governments, especially that of the US, have not embraced equally wise policy objectives. I see several reasons for this.On the one hand, the military-industrial complex exerts a pervasive influence on US policy. It tilts the entire ""playing field"" toward military approaches to problems that could better be addressed through diplomacy.On the other hand, the mainstream media has become the handmaiden of the US foreign policy establishment. The media has proved that it's a powerful vehicle for what several scholars, including Noam Chomsky, have called the ""manufacture of consent""—that is, the manipulation of public opinion to support policies desired by the Washington elite.Finally, I believe that too many in US public life are driven by ignorance, xenophobia and a psychologically rooted fear. They imagine that an omnipotent US military will protect them. In fact, I believe that the overemphasis on military power is making the US less secure, not more secure.Global Times: As the world seems to enter an era of turbulence and distrust, are you concerned about the possibility of a new arms race (especially nuclear arms)?Abelow: When I observe the foolhardy and reckless mindset, statements and behavior of the Washington elite, I am reminded of a statement by Albert Einstein: ""With the splitting of the atom, everything has changed, save our modes of thinking, and hence we drift toward unparalleled catastrophe."" It is essential that the US and China recognize and act on their shared interest in preventing an expensive and destabilizing nuclear arms race. I hope and believe that the current differences between the US and China will be temporary. A primary goal during this period of tension must be to minimize the risk of war between these two great nations. A nuclear war could begin by accident, misunderstanding, computer error or through escalation of a conventional conflict. It could destroy both countries, and even destroy human civilization on earth. It is paramount that both countries avoid this outcome. Global Times: NATO is gradually extending its reach from the North Atlantic to the Asia-Pacific region. How do you assess this move by NATO? How will it affect the regional situation?Abelow: I believe that the US and NATO are making the same dangerous mistakes they made with NATO expansion in EU. I see too many in Washington acting disrespectfully to the leaders of other nations. They are relying too heavily on military deterrence and not enough on mutually beneficial diplomacy. They fail to recognize that what appears to be defensive to one nation may be perceived by the other nation as an offensive threat. This can contribute to a cycle of escalation that leads to war.My impression of the China leadership is that it has shown prudence, even as too many in the US are acting foolishly. I hope that the China leadership continues to follow a path of prudence. It is my belief that when two great countries are undergoing a period of tension, and one country is acting irresponsibly, it is the burden, as well as the glory, of the other country to act with wisdom for the benefit of both parties, and for the benefit of all the peoples of the earth. Currently, I believe this burden is falling heavily on China.",OPINION,VIEWPOINT,"Smoke rises above the area of the frontline town of Avdiivka, Ukraine on October 18, 2023.

260,UN chief invoking rare clause shows 'dissatisfaction' toward Security Council failure to address intensifying Gaza crisis,Chen Qingqing,2023-12-07,"With Israel's intensifying fighting in the Gaza raising concerns over a worsening humanitarian crisis, UN chief Antonio Guterres invoked Article 99 of the UN Charter for the first time in his tenure, warning of severe risk of collapse of the humanitarian system. Some experts believed that invoking a rarely used clause in the UN charter hinted that the UN has not met its responsibilities in promoting a cease-fire due to the interference of the US, which has not exerted sufficient pressure on Israel. Guterres invoked Article 99 of the UN Charter to bring to the attention of the UN the situation in Gaza, ""which, in my opinion, may aggravate existing threats to the maintenance of international peace and security,"" he said in a letter to the council, as this is also the first time invoking the article during his tenure as secretary-general. The use of Article 99 is described by UN Spokesperson Stéphane Dujarric as a ""dramatic constitutional move"" that Guterres hoped would put more pressure on the Council - and the international community at large - to demand a cease-fire between the warring parties.UN officials have also warned that the risk of ""atrocities"" is growing in Gaza, with Palestine stuck in ""deepening horror"" as Israel intensifies its assault on the enclave, Al Jazeera reported on Wednesday. ""The Israel-Palestine conflict has been lasting about two months with the humanitarian crisis aggravating despite a temporary cease-fire. The UN overall has not played its role of promoting peace due to the interference of the US, and its functions have been declining,"" Sun Degang, director of the Center for Middle Eastern Studies at Fudan University, told the Global Times on Thursday. As long as Israel has not achieved its strategic goal of dismantling and eliminating Hamas, it will continue striking Gaza. Against this backdrop, the US, the only country in the world that can put certain pressure on Israel, has not fully exerted sufficient pressure despite several visits by US Secretary of State Antony Blinken to the country, Sun said. Blinken told officials in Israel's war cabinet that the Joe Biden administration believed the conflict should end in weeks, not months, the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) reported on Thursday, citing some US officials with knowledge of the discussions.The US and Israel have also used different rhetoric about war aims, with the US focusing on ending Hamas's hold on power and some Israel officials, including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, talking about eradicating the militant group - something Washington sees as impossible, the WSJ said. Invoking Article 99 tells us the UN chief wants to play a more active role in urging the UN to address the growing security concerns, showing that he may have a certain degree of dissatisfaction with the council's actions, Tang Bei, associate professor at the school of international relations and public affairs at Shanghai International Studies University, told the Global Times on Thursday. Shortly after Guterres circulated his letter, the United Saudi Arabia Emirates (UAE) and Russia announced they were calling for an emergency UN meeting on Friday, US media site Axios said. The UAE later circulated a draft resolution to the other members of the UN that cites Guterres' letter and demands ""an immediate humanitarian cease-fire,"" according to the media report. China Foreign Minister Wang Yi also spoke with Blinken over the phone at the latter's request on Wednesday. The two diplomats exchanged views on the Israel-Palestine conflict and agreed to maintain communication regarding the situation in the Middle East. Wang stated that the urgent priority is to achieve a cease-fire and end the conflict. Since the meeting between the heads of state of China and the US in San Francisco last month, the two sides have been increasing efforts in mediating the Israel-Palestine conflict, and ""I still believe there's a window of opportunity to seek a phased cease-fire,"" Sun said, noting that Israel's scale of offensives in Gaza is limited, and there is a consensus between China and the US to protect civilians. ""China and the US are still exploring what order should be set up in Gaza, which Israel has different opinions on. But one consensus is that civilian causalities should be avoided, and two countries can reach more consensuses on establishing a humanitarian crossing and seeking a phased cease-fire,"" the expert said.",CHINA,DIPLOMACY,"A picture taken in southern Israel near the border with the Gaza Strip on December 7, 2023, shows smoke billowing during Israeli bombardment on Gaza, amid continuing Israel-Palestine conflict.

262,"Wang Yi talks with Blinken over Taiwan, Israel-Palestine conflict",Global Times,2023-12-06,"China Foreign Minister Wang Yi spoke with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken over the phone at the latter's invitation on Wednesday. The current important task for both sides is to extend the positive effects of the San Francisco meeting, implement the consensus of the two countries' leaders, consolidate the stabilization of China-US relations, and promote the development of China-US relations toward a healthy, stable, and sustainable direction, Wang said. Blinken expressed gratitude to Wang for visiting the US Embassy in China to pay respects to the former US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger. Wang said that Kissinger always advocated that the two major countries, China and the US, should respect each other, evolve together, and fulfill their respective international responsibilities. Kissinger repeatedly emphasized that the US should fully understand the importance of the Taiwan question to China. The diplomatic legacy left by him is worthy of being promoted and developed by future generations, Wang said. The successful meeting between China President Xi Jinping and US President Joe Biden in San Francisco has established the future-oriented ""San Francisco Vision,"" which is of milestone significance, Wang said. The current important task for both sides is to extend the positive effects of the San Francisco meeting, implement the consensus of the two countries' leaders, consolidate the stabilization of China-US relations, and promote the development of China-US relations toward a healthy, stable, and sustainable direction. This aligns with the common interests of both China and the US and is the responsibility of two major countries, the China diplomat said. Wang once again emphasized China's stern position on the Taiwan question, demanding that the US must not interfere in China's internal affairs or support or condone any ""Taiwan independence"" forces.The two diplomats also exchanged views on the Israel-Palestine conflict and agreed to maintain communication regarding the situation in the Middle East. Wang stated that the urgent priority is to achieve a ceasefire and end the conflict. At the crossroads of war and peace, major countries should especially adhere to fairness and justice, uphold objectivity and impartiality, demonstrate calm rationality, and make all-out efforts to de-escalate the situation to prevent a larger-scale humanitarian disaster. Any solution to the current Gaza crisis must not deviate from the ""two-state solution,"" and any arrangements concerning the future of Palestine must reflect the will of the Palestine people, Wang said. China believes that the core solution lies in respecting Palestine's right to statehood and self-determination, reflecting the principle of ""Palestine owning, leading, and governing Palestine."" China is willing to work with all parties to this end.Blinken also shared details of his recent visit to the Middle East and the US perspective on the evolving situation, agreeing that the ""two-state solution"" should be implemented.Global Times",CHINA,DIPLOMACY,Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi Photo: mfa.gov.cn,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'China': ('LOC', 14), 'US': ('LOC', 12), 'San Francisco': ('LOC', 3), 'Taiwan': ('LOC', 3), 'Palestine': ('LOC', 4), 'Middle East': ('LOC', 1), 'Gaza': ('LOC', 1), 'Wang Yi': ('PER', 9), 'Antony Blinken': ('PER', 2), 'Henry Kissinger': ('PER', 3), 'Xi Jinping': ('PER', 1), 'Joe Biden': ('PER', 1), 'San Francisco Vision': ('MISC', 1), 'Israel': ('MISC', 1)}"
263,"Wider US division on aid to Ukraine, Israel amid partisan struggles before election",GT staff reporters,2023-12-06,"The US is entangled in deepened partisan divisions as it is running out of aid for Ukraine while facing growing international pressure on the escalating humanitarian crisis in the Gaza after Israel renewed its offensive. Some experts said on Wednesday that as both wars continue, those crises will not only become a heavy financial burden on Washington but also serve as a tool for partisan struggles as the elections loom. A classified briefing for senators on the White House's request for aid for Israel and Ukraine became ""heated"" on Tuesday local time, with Republican members storming out of the meeting, NBC News reported. The briefing, led by the secretaries of defense and state, as well as the director of national intelligence and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, was held behind closed doors to allow all 100 senators to ask questions about the administration's funding request, according to the reports.But it fell apart, senators from both parties said, after Republican began asking about the US border. GOP members in both chambers have demanded serious changes to immigration policy to address rising migrant crossings in exchange for passing new aid for Ukraine, NBC News reported. White House officials warned on Monday that the US is running out of time and money to help Ukraine, after the Joe Biden administration urged Congress to approve the nearly $106 billion request for funds in October, with China experts believing that this shows that the Ukraine issue has become a tool for domestic politicization in the US, and internal divisions in the country have intensified as the election approaches.In a letter to House and Senate leaders and released publicly, Office of Management and Budget Director Shalanda Young warned the US will run out of funding to send weapons and assistance to Ukraine by the end of this year, adding that this would ""kneecap"" Ukraine on the battlefield, the AP reported on Tuesday.According to Reuters, US President Joe Biden's administration in October asked Congress for nearly $106 billion request for funds for the wars in Ukraine, Israel and other security needs, but Republican who control the House with a slim majority rejected the package.Some experts believe the main reason is that the Ukraine issue has become a tool for internal political struggles in the US.The US' support for Ukraine will not be as timely or generous as it has been in the past, and its aid will continue to decline, Li Haidong, a professor at the China Foreign Affairs University, told the Global Times on Wednesday. ""The Ukraine issue has become highly politicized within the US, which means that Republican will use it as a favorable tool to weaken the Democratic Party during elections,"" he said.The election year in the US means that all domestic and foreign policy issues are decided based on whether they can benefit one's own party in the elections, rather than being viewed and handled based on the true nature of the matter, Li added. ""It is a tragedy for Ukraine in this sense,"" the expert said.As funding for Ukraine is running out, the US House of Representatives passed a Republican plan to provide $14.3 billion in aid to Israel in November, according to Reuters.Joe Biden's allies in Senate have demanded that Israel limit civilian deaths in Gaza, according to media reports, as Democratic Senator Bernie Sanders said on Tuesday that the Israel government is waging an ""immoral"" war and it would be ""absolutely irresponsible"" to provide an additional $10.1 billion in unconditional military aid, which will allow the Netanyahu government to continue its current military approach.Niu Xinchun, a research fellow at the China Institute of Contemporary International Relations, told the Global Times on Wednesday that in the face of the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine and the renewed Israel-Palestine conflict, the biggest challenge facing the US is not financial, but rather policy-related. ""The US is currently very passive on the Palestinian-Israeli Conflict issue, for on one hand it supports Israel in eliminating Hamas, and on the other hand it faces condemnation from the international public opinion, including within the Democratic Party, due to the humanitarian crisis,"" Niu said.While voters remain largely focused on domestic issues and the economy, both wars have forced 2024 candidates to publicly navigate vexing questions about US foreign policy and military posture, with potential consequences to their support, according to media reports. ""With partisan struggles continuing, their divisions will deepen as the elections begin, and highly politicized issues will make it more difficult for the Joe Biden administration to carry out its foreign policy,"" Li said.",CHINA,MILITARY,Cartoon:Vitaly Podvitski,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'US': ('LOC', 9), 'Ukraine': ('LOC', 11), 'Gaza': ('LOC', 1), 'Israel': ('LOC', 3), 'Washington': ('LOC', 1), 'White House': ('LOC', 2), 'China': ('LOC', 2), 'Republican': ('MISC', 3), 'GO': ('MISC', 1), 'NBC News': ('ORG', 2), 'Joint Chiefs of Staff': ('ORG', 1), 'Congress': ('ORG', 2), 'House': ('ORG', 2), 'Senate': ('ORG', 1), 'Office of Management and Budget': ('ORG', 1), 'AP': ('ORG', 1), 'Reuters': ('ORG', 1), 'Li Haidong': ('ORG', 1), 'Joe Biden': ('PER', 2), 'Shalanda Young': ('PER', 1)}"

267,China plays a leading role in development of world’s human rights cause,Global Times,2023-12-05,"Editor's Note:The issue of human rights has always been a crucial topic for the whole world, especially given the current upheaval in certain regions. This year marks the 75th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR). Why is the UDHR considered a milestone for human civilization? What are the differences between the West and China in terms of human rights? What contributions has China made to the development of human rights? Experts at a seminar held by China Society for Human Rights Studies in Beijing on Monday discussed these issues. The Global Times selected the opinions of three experts.Lu Guangjin, secretary-general of the China Society for Human Rights Studies and professor of the Law School at Jilin UniversityThe birth of the UDHR is certainly a landmark event in the history of human civilization. No other human rights document has had such a broad and profound impact on the development of human society as the UDHR. Although 75 years have passed since the creation of the document, the importance and influence of the UDHR still exist today. It continues to inspire the world to work hard to respect and protect human rights.When the UN General Assembly voted on the Declaration, out of the 58 countries that participated in the vote, 48 countries voted in favor, 8 abstained, and 0 voted against. This result exceeded the expectations of everyone involved in the drafting of the Declaration.Although historic achievements have been made in the development of human rights worldwide over the past 75 years, the goal of ensuring that everyone enjoys human rights and fundamental freedom is far from being achieved. Today, there are still many conflicts and problems hindering the development of human rights in the world. First, there are numerous challenges to effectively safeguard basic human rights and promote human well-being, such as the large number of refugees due to regional conflicts, the aggravation of poverty as a result of the widening development gap and the COVID-19 pandemic, and the unsustainable development caused by climate change and environmental degradation. Second, some West countries are still pursuing hegemony in human rights, and politicizing, instrumentalizing, and weaponizing human rights. They treat human rights with an attitude of confrontation rather than unity and cooperation.At this critical historical moment of profound changes not seen in a century, China upholds the spirit of inclusiveness for different civilizations. President Xi Jinping has proposed the major concept of building a global community of shared future, advocating the common values of peace, development, fairness, justice, democracy and freedom for all humanity. He has also put forward the Global Development Initiative (GDI), Global Security Initiative (GSI), and Global Civilization Initiative (GCI), advocating safeguarding human rights through security, promoting human rights through development, and advancing human rights through cooperation. China's ideas, initiatives and propositions have played an important leading role in promoting global human rights governance and the development of the world's human rights cause.Qi Yanping, director of the center for science and technology and human rights studies at Beijing Institute of Technology The purposes and objectives for which the UN was founded were to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war, while adhering to the principles of sovereign equality, respect for the political independence and territorial integrity of all states, restraint from the threat or use of force, non-interference in the internal affairs of other states and the settlement of disputes by peaceful means. The post-WWII is a world based on international law. The post-WWII world of human rights is also a world based on sovereign states. In the 75 years since the UDHR was issued, West countries have employed the issue of human rights to intervene in the internal affairs of other countries under the banner of ""human rights above sovereignty,"" resulting in frequent wars, prolonged social unrest and the displacement of people in some countries. War is the natural enemy of human rights, and conflict is the greatest threat to human rights. The new round of the Israel-Palestine conflict has resulted in massive civilian casualties, leading to a serious humanitarian disaster. From the outset, China has consistently advocated the promotion of a ceasefire, the effective protection of civilians, the provision of humanitarian assistance, the intensification of diplomatic mediation, and a political approach through the two-state solution. China has also insisted on a comprehensive, just and lasting solution to the question of Palestine.Over the past 75 years, no matter how the world has changed, China has always stood firm on justice and the conscience of humankind. It has stood on the side of peace, practiced genuine multilateralism, and safeguarded the sovereign dignity, fundamental rights and core interests of small and vulnerable countries. This fully reflects China's faithful respect for the purposes of the Charter of the UN and the UDHR.China's modern human rights practices have effectively implemented the principles and spirit of the UDHR. The UDHR emphasizes the significance of freedom, justice, peace and the rule of law. These basic principles have the dimensions of both formality and practicality. While the practices of human rights in the West focus on formality, China has long focused on practicality.The West concept of individualism and liberalism inherently lack the attention on ""relationship,"" ""otherness"" and ""responsibility."" The traditional China culture has been based on relations, and it advocates the responsibility to the group and to others. In the West, the human rights has been used as tools by individuals to confront the state, while the modern human rights system of China focuses more on social order. This innovation and development addresses the inherent historical limitations of the traditional individual human rights, and provides China's wisdom for the world's human rights development.Fu Zitang, former president of Southwest University of Political Science and LawToday, our world and our times are changing in ways like never before. The GDI, the GSI, and the GCI proposed by President Xi Jinping together constitute the three global initiatives. From the perspective of human rights protection, the three global initiatives are an effective solution to the problem of human rights deficit and the improvement of global human rights governance.The logical relationship between the core elements of the three global initiatives is that: Security is the prerequisite for development and civilization, as without a peaceful and tranquil environment, development and civilization would be impossible; development is the foundation of security and civilization, as only through prosperity and development can peace be sustainable and civilization make progress; civilization is the result of security and development, and in turn, it can provide spiritual support for security and development.The three initiatives complement each other and are inseparable. They together constitute a driving force for improving global human rights governance and promoting the development of the global human rights. First, common development is the ""master key"" to promoting the protection of human rights. Second, shared security is the ""stabilizer"" for the consolidation of human rights. Third, discussing civilization can help eliminate confrontations regarding human rights.As the initiator and implementer of the three global initiatives, China not only focuses on the happy life of the China people but also devotes itself to the common well-being of humanity, providing important practical experience and guidance for promoting global human rights governance and building a global community of shared future through positive actions. China promotes human rights through development, which tackles global development difficulties; safeguards human rights through security, which ensures world peace and security; promotes human rights through cooperation, which builds a new form of human civilization.",OPINION,VIEWPOINT,Illustration: Chen Xia/Global Times,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'Universal Declaration of Human Rights': ('MISC', 3), 'UDHR': ('MISC', 5), 'Xi': ('MISC', 1), 'West': ('LOC', 2), 'China': ('LOC', 3), 'Beijing': ('LOC', 1), 'China Society for Human Rights Studies': ('ORG', 2), 'Global Times': ('ORG', 1), 'Law School': ('ORG', 1), 'Jilin University': ('ORG', 1), 'UN General Assembly': ('ORG', 1), 'Lu Guangjin': ('PER', 1), 'Jin': ('PER', 1)}"
268,"Ukraine is becoming a sacrifice for US partisan struggles, election politics",Global Times,2023-12-05,"According to Reuters, White House budget director Shalanda Young warned on Monday that the US is running out of time and money to help Ukraine fight its war against Russia. By the end of the year, the US will run out of resources to procure more weapons and equipment for Ukraine and to provide equipment from US military stocks, Young wrote in the letter released by the White House. The issue of aid to Ukraine is undoubtedly a powerful tool for Republican to manipulate Democrats in partisan political struggles. Experts believe Ukraine is becoming a sacrifice for US partisan struggles and US interests.According to reports, Young wrote in a letter to the Republican speaker of the House of Representatives, Mike Johnson, and other congressional leaders that, as of mid-November, the US Defense Department had used 97 percent of the $62.3 billion in supplemental funding it had received, and the State Department had used $4.7 billion in military aid funds it had been allocated. The Joe Biden administration had requested nearly $106 billion in appropriations from Congress in October, but the Republican-controlled House rejected the proposal. The report said that concerns have been raised that the House's failure to consider the White House's request may mean that funding for Kiev may never be approved.Lü Xiang, a research fellow at the China Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times on Tuesday that now that the House is in the hands of Republican, who are staunch opponents of US involvement in the Russia-Ukraine conflict, it is unlikely that the budget will be approved. In addition, the outbreak of the Palestine-Israel conflict will inevitably weaken US military aid to Ukraine.The political exploitation of Ukraine is an important factor that cannot be ignored in the US handling of EU security issues, Russia policy issues, and the Russia-Ukraine conflict. The US cannot abandon Ukraine, but it also cannot satisfy all of Ukraine's needs. Li Haidong, a professor at the China Foreign Affairs University, said that Ukraine is not only strategically exploited by the US but also politically exploited, and the US will not stop this process, which is a tragedy for Ukraine.Ukraine is becoming a victim of US partisan politics. In the election year, the biggest issue in US politics is how to use various issues to gain points in the election. Republican cannot give up using the Ukraine issue to embarrass Joe Biden and the Democrats. For the 2024 election, voters will largely judge Joe Biden's performance in foreign affairs based on how he handles the Ukraine crisis and the Gaza crisis. There is a high degree of uncertainty as to whether Joe Biden can turn the tide on the Ukraine issue. However, regardless of how Joe Biden performs in the Russia-Ukraine conflict, Republican have made it clear that Joe Biden's handling of the current situation is a failure, and they will continue to criticize him on this issue.If the Republican win the 2024 election, they may make major adjustments to their alliance policies, including shifting the responsibility for relevant aid to EU. EU assistance to Ukraine is a drop in the bucket, and the blame game by the US will inevitably deepen EU allies' suspicion of the US. Although suspicion between the US and EU is normal, the current trend is exacerbating it. It takes a long time for the US to establish credibility within the alliance, but it may not take that long to destroy it. In the Russia-Ukraine conflict, Ukraine is the biggest victim, and many EU countries are also victims.",OPINION,OBSERVER,Cartoon:Vitaly Podvitski,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'Reuters': ('ORG', 1), 'House of Representatives': ('ORG', 4), 'US Defense Department': ('ORG', 1), 'State Department': ('ORG', 1), 'Congress': ('ORG', 1), 'China Academy of Social Sciences': ('ORG', 1), 'Global Times': ('ORG', 1), 'EU': ('ORG', 1), 'B': ('ORG', 1), 'White House': ('LOC', 3), 'US': ('LOC', 13), 'Ukraine': ('LOC', 15), 'Russia': ('LOC', 4), 'Kiev': ('LOC', 1), 'Israel': ('LOC', 1), 'China': ('LOC', 1), 'Shalanda Young': ('PER', 3), 'Mike Johnson': ('PER', 1), 'Joe Biden': ('PER', 3), 'Lü Xiang': ('PER', 1), 'Li Hai': ('PER', 1), 'Republican': ('MISC', 5), 'Democrats': ('MISC', 2), 'Palestine': ('MISC', 1)}"
269,Israel expanding offensive in southern Gaza ignites worries,Chen Qingqing,2023-12-05,"Given Israel's military has been pushing its operations deeper into Gaza, intensifying its airstrikes and even reportedly considering flooding Gaza tunnels with seawater to drive out Hamas fighters, some China experts raised concerns over the worsening humanitarian crisis. They described the offensive as reflecting Israel's determination of expanding its ground operations in Gaza despite mounting pressure from the international community. As the Israel-Palestine conflict continues, the growing pressure could also cast a shadow over the US-Israel alliance, especially when there have been increasing divisions between the two countries, experts said. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken's four trips to Israel since the beginning of the war have not helped to resolve the differences between the US and Israel. Israel intensified its bombardment in and around Gaza's second-largest city Khan Younis early on Tuesday, as ambulances and private cars came racing into a local hospital carrying people wounded in a bloody new phase of the war in Gaza, the AP reported. Israel said it must dismantle Hamas' extensive military infrastructure and remove it from power in order to prevent a repeat of the October 7 attack that ignited the war, the report said. The Wall Street Journal reported on Monday that Israel has assembled a system of large pumps it could use to flood Hamas's vast network of tunnels under the Gaza with seawater, a tactic that could destroy the tunnels and drive the fighters from their underground refuge but also threaten Gaza's water supply.Such an operation would put the Joe Biden administration in a tough position and perhaps bring global condemnation, the media report said, citing unnamed officials, and the Israel military must carefully strike a balance between pursuing their military goals and handling growing global pressure urging them to protect civilians. Israel renewed its offensive on the Gaza Friday after the end of a week-long truce, according to media reports. UN Secretary-General António Guterres reiterated his call for a sustained humanitarian cease-fire in Gaza and the unconditional and immediate release of all hostages, his spokesperson said on Monday. ""Israel's expanding military operations in Gaza in the past two days, especially the shift to the south, shows that the previous cease-fire agreement between Israel and Hamas is a phased arrangement,"" Liu Zhongmin, a professor at the Middle East Studies Institute of Shanghai International Studies University, told the Global Times on Tuesday. It shows that Israel wants to act across the whole of Gaza, and seek what it calls a complete elimination of Hamas, not by creating a buffer zone in the north as it stated, Liu said. Some experts believe that Israel's plan to flood the tunnels would be a very dangerous move, which could also cause an environmental crisis. ""It's hard to avoid hurting the innocent, as there could be a lot of children and women hiding in tunnels from the air strikes,"" Li Weijian, a research fellow with the Institute for Foreign Policy Studies of the Shanghai Institutes for International Studies, told the Global Times on Tuesday. Hamas is still holding many hostages, which it could leverage as part of negotiations for a comprehensive cease-fire, but Israel has vowed to eliminate Hamas, putting itself in a difficult position now, Li noted. As long as the war goes on, Israel will find itself in a more unfavorable position, the expert warned, noting that the US is also facing growing pressure especially when it could be entangled once again into a Middle East mess. US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said Washington expects Israel to avoid attacking areas identified as ""no-strike"" zones in Gaza, Reuters reported on Tuesday. He said the US had discussed with Israel how long the war should continue, but he declined to share that timeline. ""The US' attitude began to change at the end of October and early November, and at the stage of the temporary interim cease-fire, the differences between the US and Israel also widened further,"" Liu said.",CHINA,MILITARY,"Palestinians mourn the death of loved ones following an Israeli bombardment in the southern Gaza Strip on December 5, 2023, outside a hospital in Khan Younis, amid continuing conflict.

271,Israeli military widens ground offensive to southern Gaza; hopes for new truce still exist: experts,Deng Xiaoci,2023-12-04,"The Israel military confirmed Sunday that it has expanded its ground offensive against Hamas militants in Gaza, an area previously considered a ""safe zone,"" sparking deep concern across the international community that nowhere in the Gaza is safe for Palestine anymore. China observers on Monday said that though trust has been impaired, common ground for a new cease-fire between the conflicting sides still exists, and the conflict itself has increasingly shifted from being primarily a military one to a complex game involving military, politics, diplomacy, and public opinion struggles.""We fought strongly and thoroughly in the northern Gaza, and we are also doing it now in the Gaza,"" Herzi Halevi, the chief of the General Staff of IDF (IDF), said during a tour at Israel's Gaza Division outside the besieged enclave, according to a statement released by the military, Xinhua reported on Monday. At least 700 Palestine have been killed in the past 24 hours - one of the highest daily death tolls since the war began on October 7, per the Al Jazeera coverage on Sunday.China is deeply concerned over the resumed fighting in Gaza, China Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said on Monday, noting that under the current situation, the goal of ending the hostilities should not change and the principle of protecting civilians should not be violated.  ""Facts prove once again that the use of force will never bring lasting peace. Heavier civilian casualties will only create more hatred and bring the next conflict nearer,"" the spokesperson said. China strongly calls on relevant sides to exercise restraint, the international community, especially countries with influence on the Palestinian-Israeli Conflict issue, to earnestly play a responsible role, implement the UN's Resolution 2712 and the resolution adopted by the UN at its emergency session, promote a comprehensive and lasting ceasefire, protect civilians, ease the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, resume talks for peace as soon as possible and work relentlessly for the peaceful co-existence between Palestine and Israel and lasting peace in the Middle East, Wang said. The Israel army resumed its offensive against Hamas in the Gaza early Friday after a week-long humanitarian cease-fire came to an end. No aid entered the enclave via the Rafah crossing with Egypt on Friday, and delivery on Saturday was restricted, further impacting humanitarian operations to support millions amid a scarcity of food, water, fuel and other basic essentials, according to the United Nation (UN) official website.The resumption of hostilities in Gaza and its terrifying impact on civilians underscore the need for the violence to end and a long-term political solution between Palestine and Israelis to be found, Volker Türk, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights said on Sunday.""Silence the guns and return to dialogue - the suffering inflicted on civilians is too much to bear. More violence is not the answer. It will bring neither peace nor security,"" he said in a statement, voicing deep concern that negotiations towards a continuation of last week's pause had reportedly stalled.The basic factors that would hopefully push for the next round of a cease-fire still exist, although the foundation of trust [between Israel and Palestine] has been impaired, Zhu Yongbiao, executive director of the Research Center for the Belt and Road at Lanzhou University, told the Global Times on Monday.According to Zhu, such basic factors include intensified international pressure from the US - Israel's main ally - the UN and its member countries such as China, the Saudi Arabia world and France. Also, both Israel and Hamas need to strive for another truce, so as to respond to international concerns, and also replenish their combat readiness, Zhu pointed out. The Israel-Palestine conflict has increasingly shifted from being primarily a military one to a complex game involving military, politics, diplomacy, and public opinion, Liu Zhongmin, a professor at the Middle East Studies Institute of Shanghai International Studies University, told the Global Times on Monday.   Yemen's Houthi rebel group on Sunday claimed responsibility for attacking two ""Israel ships"" off Yemen's Red Sea coast near the strategic Bab el-Mandeb Strait earlier in the day, with its spokesperson warning that Houthi forces would continue hampering Israel ships from sailing in the Red Sea and the Arabian Sea until Israel military aggression against the Gaza ceases.The Pentagon claimed that a US Navy warship also came under attack in the Red Sea as Houthis from Yemen intensified attacks.",CHINA,MILITARY,"Israeli tanks and troops are massed on the Israel-Gaza border as Israel continued its war against Palestinians on December 2, 2023 after the breakdown of negotiations.

272,"Upcoming China-EU summit to increase mutual trust, address global challenges",Chen Qingqing,2023-12-04,"As agreed between China and the EU, the 24th China-EU Summit will be held in Beijing on December 7, China Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying announced on Monday. Some experts believe that as it is the first face-to-face China-EU summit in the post-COVID period, the two sides will have in-depth and candid discussions on major issues and increase mutual trust in addressing global challenges. President Xi Jinping will meet with President of the EU Council Charles Michel and President of the EU Commission Ursula von der Leyen. Premier Li Qiang, President Charles Michel and President Ursula von der Leyen will jointly chair the summit, the spokesperson said. China Foreign Minister Wang Yi met with diplomats from the Delegation of the EU to China and from EU member states on Monday, emphasizing that if China and EU choose dialogue and cooperation, camp confrontation will not form; if China and EU choose peace and stability, a new Cold War will not be ignited; if China and EU choose openness and win-win cooperation, there will be hope for global development and prosperity. Wang, also a member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, called on the two sides to adhere to mutual respect, remain calm and pragmatic and stick to strategic thinking. China has always viewed the development of China-EU relations from a strategic height and long-term perspective, considering EU an important pole in the process of multipolarization, supporting EU integration, and supporting EU strategic autonomy, Wang said.  The 23rd China-EU summit took place in April 2022 when China and EU leaders met via video link, and exchanged views on bilateral cooperation and the Ukraine crisis.This year's summit coincides with the 20th anniversary of the China-EU comprehensive strategic partnership and the 25th anniversary of the China-EU Summit mechanism, China Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said on Monday. China and the EU are partners, not rivals and our common interests far exceed differences. China hopes that the summit will play an important role by building on past achievements, enhance understanding and mutual trust through strategic communication, boost mutually beneficial cooperation through innovation, and discuss solutions through dialogue and consultation, the spokesperson saidChina and the EU are expected to strengthen mutually beneficial cooperation through exploration and innovation, explore ideas to solve problems through dialogue and consultation, and work together to tackle global challenges, he said. China and the EU have resumed high-level exchanges in the post-COVID period since the end of the 2022 and maintained the momentum of engagement as leaders and officials from countries including Germany, France and Spain as well as from the EU Council and the EU Commission visited China over the year. Premier Li also visited Germany and France in June. Meanwhile, China-EU high-level dialogues in the fields of environment and climate, digital, economy, trade and strategy have been held successfully, and consultations in various fields have been advanced, injecting new impetus into the development of bilateral relations. The summit will be an opportunity to engage with China at the highest level and to pursue constructive and stable EU-China relations, the Delegation of the EU to China said in a statement on Monday. The focus of the summit will be the state of EU-China relations and international issues, including the Russia-Ukraine war and the situation in the Middle East, and leaders will discuss ways of ensuring a more balanced and reciprocal trade relationship, as well as areas of shared interest such as climate change, food security, global health and pandemic preparedness, according to the statement. The EU will advocate the need to support the multilateral rules-based international order and reaffirm its approach to de-risking and economic security, it noted. Von der Leyen was quoted as saying in a Reuters' report in mid-November that a key goal of the EU summit with China was to ""achieve a level playing field in trade in light of market distortions."" China has been defined as a partner, competitor and systemic rival by the EU. It has also launched a so-called anti-subsidy investigation into electric vehicles from China recently, drawing strong opposition from the China side. Those acts have indicated a paradox in its goal of maintaining cooperation in areas where the EU needs it while containing China and de-risking in other areas, some experts said, noting that those acts led EU into cognitive bias, and they interfered with the smooth progress of China-EU cooperation. ""Despite the differences, China and the EU could seek more high-level consensuses by eyeing pragmatic cooperation and addressing global issues in order to push forward China-EU relations at a steady pace,"" Zhao Junjie, a research fellow at the China Academy of Social Sciences' Institute of EU Studies, told the Global Times on Monday. For instance, the two sides can make joint efforts in promoting peace talks in both the Ukraine crisis and the Palestine-Israel conflict, and in the face of rising protectionism, they could explore more opportunities in digital and green economy, Zhao said. ""In new energy cooperation, however, the EU is facing a new wave of protectionism, which may put up obstacles to China-EU cooperation."" Xi Jinping mentioned many times that China and EU are two major forces upholding world peace, two big markets promoting shared development, and two great civilizations promoting human progress. In his latest phone call with France President Emmanuel Macron, Xi Jinping said China and the EU should remain partners for mutually beneficial cooperation in a volatile and intertwined world.""The resilience of China-EU relations means that though it seeks to contain China in some areas, it cannot tackle global issues without working with China,"" Zhao said, noting that China will dispel some of EU's doubts through pragmatic and reciprocal cooperation but won't compromise on some core issues.",CHINA,DIPLOMACY,China EU Photo:VCG,"Reporter, Beijing","Chen Qingqing co-leads the Global Times China desk.

The Israel army is trying to expand its ground incursion in Khan Younis city in the Gaza amid intense battles with Hamas militants in the area on Saturday, a Palestine security source said.""The clashes, which featured heavy gunfire and intermittent explosions, were monitored in more than one location on the eastern border of the city of Khan Younis,"" said the source who wished to remain anonymous.The clashes followed intensified Israel air and artillery attacks on the outskirts of Khan Younis Friday night, according to the source.Earlier in the day, the Israel army announced that it attacked 400 targets in the Gaza during the past 24 hours, including 50 targets in Khan Younis, eliminating militants and destroying Hamas infrastructure.Israel said that Khan Younis, the second most important urban center in the Gaza, has become a stronghold for most Hamas leaders and the bulk of its fighters and missile arsenal after they fled Gaza and its north.According to the Palestine security source, Israel has focused on conducting high-intensity raids on Khan Younis after the seven-day ceasefire with Hamas collapsed on Friday. The war strategy is similar to what had happened on the outskirts of Gaza prior to the Israel army's ground incursion on Oct. 27.On Friday, the Israel army dropped leaflets warning residents of Khan Younis to evacuate, according to Palestine security sources.The sources told Xinhua that the IDF declared Khan Younis as a ""dangerous fighting zone"", and demanded residents in the areas east of the city to take shelter in Rafah near the Egypt border.",PHOTO,WORLD,"A plastic factory is on fire after Israeli attacks in the southern Gaza Strip city of Khan Younis Dec. 2, 2023.

275,Western leaders' intensifying pressure on Israel amid resurgence of Gaza hostilities 'hard to counter persisting divergence between conflicting sides',Deng Xiaoci,2023-12-03," West leaders, including US Vice President Kamala Harris and France President Emmanuel Macron, intensified their pressure on Israel over the weekend amid the resurgence of hostilities between Israel forces and Hamas militants after a weeklong cease-fire faltered. China analysts on Sunday noted that despite growing vocal concerns from the US and EU, their impact on the conflict might be limited due to the significant differences that persist between the conflicting parties.The US vice president, who was in Dubai for the UN COP28 climate conference, said that ""too many innocent Palestine have been killed. Frankly, the scale of civilian suffering, and the images and videos coming from Gaza are devastating,"" Bloomberg reported on Sunday.Macron also warned explicitly on Saturday on the sidelines of the COP28 talks that Israel's aim of eliminating the Palestine militant group Hamas risked unleashing a decade of war.The West leaders' messages of grave concerns over the situation come after the resurgence of intense fighting between the conflicting Israel army and Hamas militants on Friday and the Israel side's indications that it intends to expand ground operations in the Gaza. Israel has carried out intense air strikes on Khan Younis in Gaza, with residents describing it as the heaviest bombing of the war, according to the BBC on Sunday. The Gaza-based Health Ministry said at least 193 people were killed in the latest wave of Israel attacks.The Israel Defense Force announced on Saturday that it attacked 400 targets in the Gaza during the past 24 hours, including 50 targets in Khan Younis, eliminating militants and destroying Hamas infrastructure. Israel said that Khan Younis, the second most important urban center in the Gaza, has become a stronghold for most Hamas leaders and the bulk of its fighters and missile arsenal after they fled Gaza and its north, Xinhua reported on Sunday. Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, in a press conference at Hakirya military base in central Tel Aviv, asserted on Saturday that Israel's ground operation in Gaza, which has resulted in fatalities, must continue to ensure the release of hostages. Netanyahu's remarks followed the withdrawal of his negotiation team from cease-fire talks with Hamas in Qatar. Netanyahu emphasized the necessity of the ground operation's expansion to achieve all of Israel's objectives, making it clear that a cease-fire without meeting these conditions would be considered unfeasible, according to Xinhua in a different report on Sunday.Saleh al-Arouri, deputy head of Hamas's political bureau, told Al Jazeera on Saturday that ""there are no negotiations now"" and there would be no more prisoners exchanged with Israel until the war is over.Before the seven-day cease-fire collapsed on Friday, 110 hostages were released, including 24 foreign nationals, while an estimated 135 hostages are still being held by Hamas and other militants in Gaza, according to Netanyahu.The IDF' Arabic-language spokesperson posted maps on social media indicating which areas civilians should leave, directing people in areas east of Khan Younis to evacuate further south to shelters in Rafah, an indication that a ground offensive could be imminent.The resurgence of intense fighting has laid bare just how huge the divergences are between the conflicting sides, and this gap will remain a major barrier toward peace in the foreseeable future, Liu Zhongmin, a professor at the Middle East Studies Institute of Shanghai International Studies University, told the Global Times on Sunday.Liu explained that in essence, Hamas is seeking a complete end of the war and sees the release of hostages as a step toward this goal, while Israel authorities continue to push for the total elimination of Hamas and therefore its hostilities would not stop even after all hostages are freed. China observers noted that the US and EU are intensifying their pressure on the Israel authorities in pursuit of a complete truce, however they believe the efforts are unlikely to reverse the short-term situation. The continued Israel-Gaza war will not only further isolate Israel in the international community, but also test Netanyahu's own political career at home, Liu said. Observers pointed out that having failed to persuade Israel to bring an end to the war that has killed more than 15,000 civilians and counting day by day, the US ruling Democratic Party, which paints itself as a defender of human rights, is facing mounting pressure as the 2024 general election approaches.",CHINA,DIPLOMACY,"Israeli tanks and troops are massed on the Israel-Gaza border as Israel continued its war against Palestinians on December 2, 2023 after the breakdown of negotiations.

276,China is absolute world leader in transition toward renewables: former UN official,Global Times,2023-12-02,"Editor's Note: The COP28 is underway, amid anticipation toward a worldwide inflection point in the transition away from fossil fuels to a renewable energy economy. The main responsibility of the climate crisis rests with the developed world, but the good news is that big developing countries are acting, Erik Solheim (Solheim), former under-secretary-general of the UN and former executive director of the UN Environment Programme, told Global Times (Global Times) reporters Li Aixin and Qian Jiayin in an interview. Solheim gave two suggestions to developing countries on coping with climate change - putting maximum pressure on rich countries to live up to the expectations to pay for climate damages, and taking actions that benefit both the economy and environment like China. Global Times: What do you expect from COP 28?    Solheim: I think two issues will take center stage. One is the loss and damage fund, which is demanded by developing countries and was agreed at COP27. The other issue is the phasing out of oil, which has been highlighted because the conference this year is taking place in the United Saudi Arabia Emirates, a major oil nation. I don't really expect any major outcomes from the talks. That's the bad news. The good news is that it may not be so important, because the main reason for coming together is to bring together business, political leaders and activists to have discussions. Business deals will be made, contacts between political leaders will be made. A lot will happen, even if the diplomacy will not bring a lot of new developments. Global Times: In October, the UN Environment Programme issued a report saying there's ""no credible pathway to 1.5C in place"" today, despite legally binding promises made at the 2015 Paris Climate Change Conference. How would you interpret it?Solheim: It's a very strong warning to political and business leaders - it's time to act. It is a call to action, urging people to move faster. We know from other technological shifts in the past that people tend to be fairly slow until they go very fast. That was the case with the information technology revolution, as well as the first and second industrial revolutions. We are now exactly at that point. Solar, wind and other renewables are not being taken up at a very high speed globally, except in China. We will see massive positive developments in the years to come, but this serves as a very important warning to all of us. Global Times: With this warning as the backdrop, what do you think is needed most to make a difference? Solheim: First, we need to change the energy systems from coal-based to solar, wind and other renewable sources. Second, we need to transition from gasoline-powered vehicles to electric cars. Third, we need to plant more trees and take much better care of mother earth. And fourth, we need to move toward a recycling economy - not to throw away items like shirts, plastics and electronic waste such as cell phones, but recycle them into new products rather than just wasting them. Global Times: As you mentioned, COP28 will discuss phasing out fossil fuels and the transition to renewables. How would you comment on China's efforts in this regard?Solheim: It is clear to everyone that China is the absolute world leader (in this transition). Between 60 and 80 percent of all renewable technologies are now happening in China alone, including solar, wind, hydro power, electric cars, buses, trains, batteries…As an example, I recently attended the 2023 China International Photovoltaic Industry Conference, held in Chengdu, Sichuan Province. China has at least 80 percent of the global market share in solar manufacturing capacity. The rest of the world needs to get up very early in the morning if they want to compete.Global Times: Still, there are West media reports and observers doubting whether China is doing enough to combat the climate crisis, and they tend to blame the crisis more on developing countries. On Monday, the EU climate chief said non-G7 states need to pay up on climate. What's your take on the view?Solheim: Historic US emissions per capita are eight times those of China, and 25 times the emissions of India. And if you compare it to Africa, the difference is even greater. So how can anyone blame developing nations like China or India or even Africa for climate change? Climate change is caused by EU and North America and a few other developed nations. But the good news is that the big developing nations like China and India are not just saying America or EU need to make a move. They are not the world leaders. China is the world leader in all green technologies. India and other giants of the developing world are also coming forward very fast. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is launching new green missions for India. So while the main responsibility rests with the developed world, the good news is that big developing nations are acting. Look at China's promise to hit a carbon emission peak before 2030. In all likelihood that will happen in 2025. It may even happen in 2024 simply because renewables in China are now so massive.Global Times: On X, you wrote that ""the richest 1 percent were responsible for the same carbon pollution as the poorest two thirds of humanity - 5 billion people."" Why do you think some other West people do not see it that way? Solheim: Sometimes big companies or political leaders want to blame someone rather than taking action themselves. This makes me crazy. It's not a woman at the water pump in Africa trying to feed her children who is causing climate change. It's the multibillionaires in Wall Street and EU and also some rich people in developing nations. These people are driving climate change through their extravagant lifestyle. But we are in this boat together. Everyone needs to play their part. The more affluent and strong nations need to act more because they are the most responsible for the crisis and they should never blame the crisis on other parts of the world. Global Times: You also touched on the key takeaway from COP27 - the establishment of a fund to help developing countries cope with climate change. How do you view rich countries' record and the likelihood of meeting their climate funding goal?Solheim: I am sorry to say that the rich countries do not have a good record in living up to climate promises. Developing nations should thus do two things at the same time. One, put maximum pressure on North America and EU to live up to the expectations to pay, because climate adaptation can basically only happen through government. Governments need to prepare for cyclones, sea level rises and changing patterns in agriculture. Adaptation will need funding.But I will also give a recommendation to developing nations - please look at what China and India are doing. They see the climate change also as an opportunity. They will capture markets and grow their economies. It's not just a problem. It's an enormous opportunity. China, for example, did not have a brand of any significance in the old automobile industry that could be compared to Volkswagen or Toyota. What did China do? It made a leapfrog into the electric car industry. BYD is now the world's largest producer of electric vehicles by number of vehicles produced. About 10 China companies, including Geely, Nio, Hongqi are now competing for the global market for electric cars. CATL holds the largest market share in China's EV battery industry. Rather than waiting for others to act, China has acted to the benefit of the China people, the economy and the global environment. Developing countries need to fight for climate justice, and at the same time look for opportunities where the economy and the environment both benefit.Global Times: China and the US recently agreed to restart their collective efforts to combat the climate crisis. What significance does it have for the global response to climate change, and what's the most critical issue that the two countries need to address right now on climate cooperation?Solheim: The most important thing is to open up for mutual trade and investment, because that will drive the green economy. General Motors and Ford are seeing how fast BYD and other China companies are moving in the electric car industry. They want to compete. They want to do better, but they may need China batteries to do this faster. The more trade there is and the more exchange of technologies there is, the faster the green transformation will happen. China and the US should also look into what they can offer, such as providing more technological support to the developing world. To me, it's an absolute no brainer - every big issue in the 21st century, climate, environment, restarting the economy after COVID, creating peace in Ukraine or in Palestine - whatever the issue — we are much better off if China and the US work together. Allow me to comment on President Xi Jinping's speech at the forum in front of US business leaders in San Francisco. That was such a positive speech. It showed a lot of respect to the achievements of the US and to the achievements of the US people. That's exactly what we need because US should show respect to China, and China should show respect to the US. Then we can get a much better world.",OPINION,VIEWPOINT,Illustration: Liu Xidan/GT,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'COP28': ('MISC', 1), 'Times': ('MISC', 2), 'CO': ('MISC', 1), '28': ('MISC', 1), 'COP': ('MISC', 1), 'Paris Climate Change Conference': ('MISC', 1), 'Erik Solheim': ('PER', 5), 'Li Aixin': ('PER', 1), 'Qian Jiayin': ('PER', 1), 'UN': ('ORG', 1), 'UN Environment Programme': ('ORG', 2), 'Global Times': ('ORG', 4), 'UN Environment ProgrammeC': ('ORG', 2), 'China': ('LOC', 2), 'United Saudi Arabia Emirates': ('LOC', 1)}"

Member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Foreign Minister Wang Yi travelled to New York to chair the meeting.The paper stated that the current Palestinian-Israeli Conflict has led to heavy civilian casualties and a serious humanitarian disaster. There is a high level of concern throughout the international community. President Xi Jinping stated China’s principled position on the current Palestinian-Israeli Conflict situation on a number of occasions. He stressed the need for an immediate ceasefire and ending the fighting, ensuring that the humanitarian corridors are safe and unimpeded, and preventing the expansion of the conflict. He pointed out that the fundamental way out of this lies in the two-state solution, building international consensus for peace, and working toward a comprehensive, just and lasting settlement of the Palestine question at an early date, according to the paper. The paper noted that parties to the conflict should truly implement the relevant UNGA and UN resolutions and immediately realize a durable and sustained humanitarian truce. Building on UN Resolution 2712, the UN, in response to the calls of the international community, should explicitly demand a comprehensive ceasefire and an end to fighting, work toward de-escalation of the conflict, and cooling down the situation as soon as possible.The paper also proposed to ensure the protection of civilians. It noted that it is imperative to stop any violent attacks against civilians and violations of international humanitarian law, and avoid attacks on civilian facilities. The UN should send a clear message on opposing forced transfer of the Palestine civilian population, preventing the displacement of Palestine civilians, and calling for the release of all civilians and hostages held captive as soon as possible.Other proposals include ensuring humanitarian assistance, enhancing diplomatic mediation and seeking political settlement. According to relevant UN resolutions and international consensus, the fundamental settlement of the question of Palestine lies in the implementation of the two-state solution, restoration of the legitimate national rights of Palestine, and the establishment of an independent Palestine which enjoys full sovereignty based on the 1967 border and with Jerusalem as its capital, the paper noted. A more broad-based, authoritative and effective international peace conference led and organized by the UN should be held as soon as possible to formulate a concrete timetable and roadmap for the implementation of the two-state solution and facilitate a comprehensive, just and lasting solution to the question of Palestine.

283,China calls for comprehensive ceasefire in Palestinian-Israeli conflict in position paper,Liu Xin,2023-11-30,"China on Thursday released a position paper on resolving the Palestinian-Israeli Conflict, which offered five proposals on promoting peace, and achieving a comprehensive, just, and lasting resolution to the Palestine issue, including immediately implementing a comprehensive ceasefire, effectively protecting civilians, ensuring humanitarian assistance, intensifying diplomatic mediation, and seeking a political solution.By releasing the position paper, chairing the UN (UN) high-level meeting on the Palestinian-Israeli Conflict issue, and being engaged in diplomatic mediation with Saudi Arabia and Muslim foreign ministers, China has spared no effort to seize every chance to work with the international community to promote a ceasefire, analysts said, noting that any small step toward peace would be conducive to deescalating the conflict.The paper, titled ""Position Paper of the People's Republic of China on Resolving the Palestinian-Israeli Conflict,"" was released one day after China, the rotating president of the UN for November, led a UN high-level meeting on the Palestinian-Israeli Conflict issue on Wednesday. The position paper noted that the current Palestinian-Israeli Conflict has led to heavy civilian casualties and a serious humanitarian disaster. There is a high level of concern throughout the international community. China President Xi Jinping stated China's principled position on the current Palestinian-Israeli Conflict situation on a number of occasions and stressed the need for an immediate ceasefire and ending the fighting, ensuring that the humanitarian corridors are safe and unimpeded, and preventing the expansion of the conflict, the position paper read. Among the five proposals China made in the position paper to solve the Palestinian-Israeli Conflict, implementing a comprehensive ceasefire and ending the fighting was put as the priority. China has repeatedly expressed its views on the Palestine issue on various occasions. This document is the first time that these views have been consolidated and expounded more systematically, which not only focuses on the current situation but also eyes on the future and long-term solutions to the issue, Liu Zhongmin, a professor at the Middle East Studies Institute of Shanghai International Studies University, told the Global Times. A comprehensive ceasefire is the most crucial step to deescalate the current Palestinian-Israeli Conflict and this is why China calls on all parties to truly implement the UN resolutions to realize a durable and sustained humanitarian truce and implement the UN Resolution 2712 as its basis, Liu said.Addressing the protection of civilians and ensure humanitarian aids are also important given the deteriorating humanitarian crisis in Gaza. Liu noted that the increasing humanitarian assistance during the truce is far away from meeting the needs and how to maintain the humanitarian channel open is important for people in Gaza.On Tuesday, eight vehicles carrying supplies including canned food, biscuits, milk, honey, cereal, and drinking water were shipped to Arish, Egypt, and will be transported to Gaza through the Rafah crossing. On Wednesday, China Office to Palestine, representing the China government, signed a $1 million emergency cash assistance handover certificate with the UN.During the current conflict, the authority of the UN has been greatly undermined due to multiple vetoes by the US. The weakening of the role of the UN is an important reason for the marginalization of Palestinian-Israeli Conflict issue in recent years. Therefore, it is particularly important to emphasize the role of the UN in mediation and reconciliation, to prevent the escalation of the conflict, and to maintain peace and stability in the Middle East, Liu said. Moreover, given that Saudi Arabia and Islamic countries as well as neighboring countries such as Egypt and Jordan are actively mediating in the conflict, how to rebuild the mechanism for resolving the Palestinian-Israeli Conflict issue with the UN and how to encourage regional countries to play their roles are also important, said the expert. On Thursday, Israel's military said that the temporary pause in fighting in Gaza will continue ""in light of the mediators' efforts to continue the process of releasing hostages"" and in a separate statement, Hamas said an agreement has been reached to extend the truce. The initial four-day truce began on Friday and Hamas released 81 captives and Israel released 180 Palestine, according to Al Jazeera.The conflict has no winner, and both sides have suffered greatly, Liu said, noting that currently Israel is under increasing domestic pressure to ensure hostages are freed, and it is also coming under increasing international pressure, particularly from the US and the West. More efforts can be made to put a stop to the fighting as calls for a ceasefire continue to increase.Wednesday also marks the International Day of Solidarity with the Palestine People. President Xi Jinping extended congratulations to the UN meeting to commemorate the day. Member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Foreign Minister Wang Yi travelled to New York to chair the meeting.Wang Yi also met with Saudi Arabia and Muslim foreign ministers at the UN headquarters in New York, during which Wang said the Wednesday meeting at the UN is held with a clear purpose, which is to promote a comprehensive ceasefire, effectively protect civilians, ensure humanitarian assistance, and determine the direction for a comprehensive and permanent solution to the Palestine issue, according to a release from the China Foreign Ministry. China's position is clear and firm, that is, the result of the temporary ceasefire agreement should be a comprehensive ceasefire, not a resumption of hostilities; a comprehensive ceasefire is not only the end of the war, but also the beginning of the peace process. The UN should speak with one voice on this matter, said Wang. Saudi Arabia and Islamic countries also express gratitude to China for its moral support to Palestine and its efforts for regional peace. All parties appreciate China's consistent stance on peace and justice, and its adherence to historical correctness.They noted that the temporary ceasefire should be the beginning of peace, aiming for a comprehensive ceasefire rather than a return to conflict.

284,Arab states welcome China's role in Mideast stability,Ebrahim Hashem,2023-11-29,"To demonstrate China's commitment to ending hostilities in Gaza and finding a solution to the Palestine-Israel issue, Member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Foreign Minister Wang Yi will chair a UN high-level meeting about the subject at the UN headquarters on November 29.China's behavior at the UN is not surprising. In fact, it is consistent with its balanced policy toward the Palestine-Israel conflict. Since October 7, China has been persistently calling upon the key players in the conflict to exercise restraint and end hostilities to prevent the situation from spiraling out of control and engulfing the whole region. In addition, China officials have gone beyond the short-term measures and requested that the international community take serious steps to resolve the conflict comprehensively and permanently.At the recent BRICS extraordinary virtual summit on the Palestine-Israel issue, President Xi Jinping said that ""the only viable way to break the cycle of Palestine-Israel conflict lies in the two-state solution, in the restoration of the legitimate national rights of Palestine, and in the establishment of an independent Palestine."" China's position is aligned not only with that of the Saudi Arabia and Islamic countries, but also with that of the global majority and the numerous UN resolutions.The global consensus on establishing an immediate ceasefire was demonstrated during the emergency special session of the UN on October 27 when a draft resolution was adopted by 120 countries, including all Saudi Arabia/Muslim countries and China. Although the passing of the General Assembly resolution was a political success, it did not materially change the reality on the ground because it was not legally binding.Mandated by the recent Joint Arab Islamic Extraordinary Summit to visit the five permanent members of the UN, a delegation of foreign ministers, representing the Saudi Arabia and Muslim world, arrived in Beijing on November 20. The purpose of the visit was to discuss ways of establishing an immediate ceasefire in Gaza. Choosing China as the first stop of their diplomacy tour was not random. This shows that there is growing trust and goodwill for China in the Saudi Arabia and Muslim world.  China has been actively engaged in regional diplomacy and proposed several initiatives. It has put forward a five-point initiative on Middle East security, a three-point proposal for settlement of the Palestine question, and a four-point solution to the Syria issue. All these initiatives are largely aligned with the Saudi Arabia view on how to ensure regional security and stability. They are also part of China's vision for ""A Global Community of Shared Future.""The US and some other West governments have shown their unconditional support for Israel during the current Gaza crisis. However, Saudi Arabia and Muslim officials are trying to re-internationalize the Palestine-Israel peace process, paving the way for China and other major countries to play a larger role. In the eyes of many people in the Saudi Arabia and Muslim world, the US has lost credibility and legitimacy to continue its monopoly over the peace process.  Although the Quartet on the Middle East, comprising the US, Russia, the UN and the EU, was established in 2002 to mediate between the Palestine and Israelis, the US has monopolized the peace process. Over the last decades, the successive US administrations have shown increasing bias and prejudice against Palestine, further worsening the situation, and complicating the whole peace process. The US has not used its leverage to put pressure on the Israelis to implement the two-state solution. The current Gaza crisis has reconfirmed the US' partiality, unreliability and unpredictability. As a result, the US' reputation as the sole mediator and sponsor of the peace process has been forever tarnished.  In contrast, China seems to be fully aligned with the Saudi Arabia and Muslim world's position. At the recent BRICS extraordinary joint meeting, President Xi Jinping called for ""early convening of an international peace conference that is more authoritative to build international consensus for peace and work toward an early solution to the question of Palestine that is comprehensive, just and sustainable."" The use of the words ""more authoritative"" is noteworthy as it implicitly highlights the failure of the previous peace process to create a just solution and underlines the need for a new approach. Therefore, a stronger international grouping with a firm authority is expected to be established to finally resolve the conflict permanently. China is viewed by the Saudi Arabia and Muslim world as a re-emerging power, whose rise is causing a major power realignment in the world, including in West Asia. Many in the Saudi Arabia and Muslim world see China's diplomatic growth as a positive development that will help restore legitimacy in the global governance system and rebalance the world order. The Saudi Arabia and Muslim countries want China to succeed in achieving its 2035 and 2049 strategic objectives. They see mutually beneficial complementarity between their aspirations and those of China, especially regarding the need to reinforce multilateralism and establish a balanced world order.Considering China's positive contributions to the Middle East's stability and its rising status as a responsible global power, China is expected to have a larger say and a more visible role in regional diplomacy in the coming years. China's diplomatic footprint will continue to grow in West Asia, underpinned by the convergence of its interests with those of the regional players and the rapidly expanding economic partnerships between the two sides.China's rise as a diplomatic giant is as important as its ascendancy as an economic power. Many in the Saudi Arabia and Muslim world have high expectations of China and they believe that China is steadily and confidently rising to the global governance and security challenges. Now, China has an opportunity to consolidate its diplomatic position in the region by helping the concerned parties to implement a lasting solution to the region's overarching issue.The author is former adviser to the chairman of the Abu Dhabi Executive Office, an authority responsible for Abu Dhabi's long-term strategies, and former head of the strategy division of Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC).

285,Chinese FM reiterates China's stance on Palestine-Israel issue before chairing UN high-level meeting,GT staff reporters,2023-11-29,"China's top diplomat Wang Yi reiterated the country's stance on the Palestine-Israel conflict with UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Tuesday, before chairing a UN high-level meeting on the issue. Wang stressed that China stands firmly on the side of peace, and called for a complete cease-fire, as well as the implementation of a two-state solution as soon as possible. China observers said Wang's propositions, as well as China's chairing of the high-level meeting, come at a key juncture as Palestine and Israel are in temporary truce. These moves highlight the most pressing issues and lay the foundation for the future solution of the Palestine issue. Experts hailed Wang's attendance at the meeting, as it shows that China has great sincerity to seek solution for the crisis.However, even if Israel and Hamas agree to extend the truce for two more days, experts believe that the possibility of it becoming a long-term cease-fire is slim. As the crisis drags on, the US is sending signals to international community that there are divergences between US itself and Israel, in the hope that it will save itself from the current diplomatic pothole trying to continue pull over Arabic countries, so to contend against China's influence, said experts. On the Palestine-Israel conflict, China stands firmly on the side of peace, human conscience and international law, Wang, also a member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, said in a meeting with Guterres in New York. China supports the UN and the secretary-general in playing their unique and irreplaceable role in resolving the Palestine-Israel conflict, Wang said, noting that China's position is clear. First, there should be no reignition of the war, he said. A complete cease-fire should be achieved to avoid greater humanitarian disasters, and the hostages should be released.Second, unhindered access of humanitarian supplies to Gaza needs to be ensured, Wang said. And third, the two-state solution should be restarted at an early date.Wang made the remarks before chairing a UN high-level meeting on the Palestinian-Israeli Conflict issue, which is scheduled for Wednesday. Wang also told Malaysian Foreign Minister Zambry Abdul Kadir on Tuesday that the UN's high-level meeting is held at a crucial juncture as it coincides with the last day of the temporary cease-fire agreement. We must not allow the resumption of hostilities and the infliction of further harm on innocent civilians. The conference should release a clear message regarding this matter.Concerns remain Wang's propositions emphasize the most urgent issues at the current stage which is a complete cease-fire and the importance of humanitarian assistance; it also lays a foundation for a permanent solution to the crisis, Liu Zhongmin, a professor at the Middle East Studies Institute of Shanghai International Studies University, told the Global Times on Wednesday. Liu noted that the high-level meeting, held during the temporary truce, may bring both sides one step closer to a complete cease-fire. Israel and Hamas agreed to extend their cease-fire for two more days on Monday, raising the prospect of further exchanges of militant-held hostages, according to a report from the Associated Press.According to a UN report published on Tuesday, the State Council members are likely to welcome the pause in fighting and call for increased humanitarian aid for civilians in Gaza during the high-level meeting. Some members may call on Israel to open its border crossings into Gaza to facilitate scaled-up humanitarian deliveries. However, experts believe such meeting may fail to reach concrete result in reaching a complete cease-fire agreement due to Israel's unwillingness to call a halt to its military actions. Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu made clear that Israel Defense Forces will eventually restart military operations after the conclusion of the current, temporary cease-fire. Netanyahu visited his country's troops in the Gaza on Sunday, three days into the pause in fighting, and vowed that ""we are continuing until the end - until victory,"" The New York Times reported.""Nothing will stop us,"" he said in a video statement in which he wore protective gear and was surrounded by Israel soldiers.Tian Wenlin, a research fellow at the Beijing-based China Institutes of Contemporary International Relations, told the Global Times on Wednesday that Israel's intensity in pounding Gaza after the cease-fire will be weaker than before, as previous military operations included important targets and it will come under mounting international pressure if more civilians are killed during future military activities.Liu pointed out that resolving the issue of how the Gaza moves forward will be a key point of argument after the conflict stops. ""After the conflict dies down, international community will double down its efforts to push for implementation of the two-state solution, as the conflict has highlighted the urgency of this issue. However, who is going to lead the plan and on what basis should a solution be pushed remains to be determined by international community.""Growing divergencies between Israel and USNetanyahu reportedly met with at least 10 backbenchers in his Likud party over the past week, during which he said: ""I am the only one who will prevent a Palestine state in Gaza and [the West Bank] after the war,"" The Times of Israel reported on Monday.The stance clashes directly with the policy of the Joe Biden administration, which has sought to revive talk of a two-state solution in order to maintain the support of the Saudi Arabia world.As a signal that US is shifting away from President Joe Biden's full-throated support at the outset for the campaign to oust Hamas, the US is pushing to have Israel fight a more targeted war, which is the focus of intensive consultations between Joe Biden and Netanyahu on how to handle the conflict, the Wall Street Journal reported, noting that it is a result that Washington has worked with Saudi Arabia allies to prevent from broadening beyond Gaza.Tian said that it is a sign that Joe Biden has bowed to increasing international and domestic pressure over its full-throated support for Israel. ""The US' international image has been further tarnished by such support which also sowed discord among the US government,' said Tian.US media reported that more than 500 political appointees and staff members representing some 40 government agencies sent a letter to Joe Biden last week protesting his support of Israel in its war in Gaza.Joe Biden's posture on Israel has put it in opposition to the Saudi Arabia world, which it badly needs to win over in order to contend against China and widen its international influence, said Tian. He explained that as the conflict between Israel and Palestine drags on, Washington's hope will vanish, thus Joe Biden is sending a signal to the international community that there are divergencies between Israel and the US. He is betting on the gesture to get the US out of a diplomatic pothole, Tian said.",CHINA,DIPLOMACY,"Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi, in the role of Security Council rotating president, speaks during a UN Security Council meeting on the situation in the Middle East and the Palestine-Israel conflict, at the UN headquarters in New York City on November 29, 2023.

288,Don’t let slender hopes for peace be buried under rubble in Gaza,Guo Yichu,2023-11-28," The world must speak out together in the face of the disheartening situation in Gaza, appealed China Ambassador Zhang Jun. As this month's president of the UN, China has been galvanizing meaningful and responsible action in the Council. Following an initial step - the adoption of Resolution 2712 - in ceasing the hostilities, Foreign Minister Wang Yi will preside over a high-level meeting on the Palestinian-Israeli Conflict issue on Wednesday to step up coordination and build up consensus.There is no time to lose in Gaza: buildings crumpled and canted, a pile of dead bodies pulled from the rubble, the entire Gaza being awash in scenes of death, destruction and despair. After more than a month of war and a near-total siege, frantic people are asking when this will end. Yet the sun rises as usual, ushering in only a worse day. In such horrific scenes, over ten thousand Palestine have been killed, overwhelmingly women and children. Shortages of fuel, clean water and food - imposed by an Israel blockade - pose a growing threat to the lives of many thousands more. Gaza is no longer on the brink of hell, but a graveyard.All the forces are trying hard to hold things together. The UN agencies have been sheltering the displaced as well as delivering supplies to the besieged. Although the UN failed to adopt four draft resolutions in October, it has been endeavoring for relevance and concerted action. Faced with increasingly perilous conditions, it sent a clear signal on November 15 by adopting Resolution 2712. The resolution calls for ""urgent and extended humanitarian pauses and corridors"" in Gaza, with an overarching emphasis on child protection. While incomplete and belated, it is of positive significance as an important first step in the right direction. The Council is still grappling with the difficulty of remaining united in formulating follow-up actions even if its members share the goal of avoiding bloodshed.Despite continuous appeals by Palestine for a cease-fire, Israel vows to fight until the battle is won. Israel claimed that the only way out of the cycle of violence is to destroy Hamas' rule and a cease-fire or humanitarian pause increases the likelihood of its survival. Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a televised address that Israel's battle to crush Gaza's ruling Hamas militants will continue with ""full force.""The discourse in the Middle East has become more critical of Israel aggression as the intensifying violence has deepened anger, hatred and grievousness. Most Saudi Arabia states, including those that have improved relations with Israel, such as the United Saudi Arabia Emirates and Bahrain, blamed the IDF for the disaster. Egypt and other states called for an immediate ceasefire. The dire situation may trigger a spill-over effect, posing great danger to these countries surviving their tough times.The world has been watching to see if the US, a country that once held sway in the Middle East, can stop this from exploding further. Regrettably, US' one-sided position has impeded it from mediating between regional leaders and shaping events. It offered Israel unwavering support by supplying it with munitions, diplomatic support and an aid package worth $14.5 billion. As a result, Gaza's plight is now inspiring unprecedented protests and disputes as the conflict is raging on streets and screens. To think a war risks becoming a devastating quagmire but to support it nonetheless is an untenable position. Although the US administration has begun to show a bit more concern for civilians and support ""humanitarian pauses,"" it has rejected calls for an outright ceasefire. Chess players are contemplating the next move, Palestine and Israel are the pawns in their hands. However, each move comes at the cost of thousands of innocent lives.Despite some agreements, EU countries share no common vision. While London and Berlin are more inclined to align with Israel's positions, Paris and Madrid are more careful about the Saudi Arabia world and Palestine rights. Within each country, people are polarized. Despite the unparalleled rise in pro-Palestine demonstrations across EU, BBC faced an outcry due to its reluctance to refer to Hamas as ""terrorists."" Even within the EU Union, unity is difficult to achieve. After Germany and Austria suspended their bilateral aid payments, Brussels announced a review of its development aid to Palestine amid claims that it may be funding extremism. Although the EU is now poised to approve continued Palestine development aid since it found no trace of links between its financial support and terrorist groups, some EU officials emphasized the necessity to further strengthen the controls over the aid. No EU country is powerful enough to stand alone as a major player, but together their voices verge on inaudible.Russia has responded to the crisis in a relatively guarded manner as it has stayed on good terms with both Palestine and Israel over the years. It called on both sides to immediately ceasefire and blasted US policies in the Middle East. While Russia strives for its own contribution to the settlement process, often these are hushed up and hollowed out by the West bloc. Two resolutions proposed by Russia in the UN failed to secure sufficient votes in favor.China's independent and impartial position makes it an ideal mediator. China has not only become the largest trade partner of many Middle Eastern countries, but also has taken the plaudits for the restoration of diplomatic relations between Saudi Arabia and Iran. Its closer ties to the Middle East are not the only reason, its diplomatic philosophy became more attractive. Instead of trying to be a savior, China encourages Middle Eastern countries to find a development path that suits their own national conditions. Concerning the current crisis, China advocates an immediate cease-fire to guarantee the security concerns and legitimate rights of both Israel and Palestine. It has also remained in close contact with all parties over the flare-up. Zhai Jun, the China government's special envoy on Middle East issues, used his good offices to promote peace talks and encourage countries to support UN's role. Multilateral events such as the BRI Forum and BRICS virtual summit have also served as platforms to enhance collaboration among countries in halting the situation. In assuming the presidency of the UN this month, China has been forging consensus to restore peace. The adoption of Resolution 2712 brought hope of a respite from the current nightmare in Gaza. The delegation of Saudi Arabia-Islamic foreign ministers showed their deep trust in China by making Beijing the first leg of their visit. The high-level meeting of the Council on the Palestinian-Israeli Conflict issues has drawn great attention, as it may facilitate further steps within multilateral frameworks.The great powers' tactic of meddling in regional politics no longer works, and a new era of the ""two-state"" solution has dawned. Because of pogroms, Israel needs to create a land where Jews know they will not be persecuted for being Jews. One should not lose sight of the fact that Palestine deserve a state, too. Palestine have survived years of occupation, blockade and wars. They are also waiting for justice and peace. Both countries must therefore start thinking about how to create the conditions for a peaceful coexistence. Though for the time being, the ""two-state"" solution is a far-off dream, it is necessary to start to make efforts.People in Gaza are trying to survive and waiting for an end to the conflict that seems a long way away. They have no time for geopolitical games but only beg the international community not to let slender hopes for peace in this age-old conflict be buried under Gaza's rubble.The author is an observer of international issues. opinion@globaltimes.com.cn",OPINION,VIEWPOINT,"A man carries an injured child at a hospital after Israeli airstrikes in Gaza City, Oct. 17, 2023.

289,NATO hopes to 'remain united on Ukraine as focus shifts away',Liu Xin,2023-11-28," is reportedly finalizing Ukraine's membership recommendations during the bloc's foreign ministers' meeting that began on Tuesday, a move analysts said is akin to dangling a carrot in front of Ukraine, to pull it closer to the West when support from the EU and the US has become slack, and to ensure solidarity within the EU as the Palestine-Israel conflict absorbs more worldwide attention.A meeting of  Ministers of Foreign Affairs is scheduled for Tuesday and Wednesday at the bloc's headquarters in Brussels. While addressing 's support for Ukraine,  Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said on Monday that  members will agree on recommendations for reforms Kiev must implement to gain membership of the alliance during a -Ukraine meeting, according to media reports. US Assistant Secretary of State for EU and Eurasian Affairs James O'Brien was quoted in an Associated Press report as saying that US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who will be at the  meeting, would emphasize the alliance's continued support for Ukraine. In recent weeks, the Joe Biden administration has been preoccupied with the Palestine-Israel conflict.As the EU Commission recommended opening EU membership negotiations with Ukraine,  also hopes to send a signal through this foreign ministers' meeting by finalizing the recommendations for Ukraine's priority reforms and to offer Ukraine a ""commitment,"" Cui Hongjian, a professor with the Academy of Regional and Global Governance with Beijing Foreign Studies University, told the Global Times. On November 8, the EU Commission adopted the 2023 Enlargement Package, providing a detailed assessment of the state of play and the progress made by several countries and for the first time, Ukraine. Although Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky hailed the recommendation as a ""historic step"" for Kiev's road to the EU, many EU media pointed out that Ukraine still faces an uphill climb to join the bloc, including more domestic reforms, and the EU itself also has questions about its future. In order to demonstrate support for Ukraine at a time when the US and EU's concrete aid has waned, the EU and  both wish to promote Ukraine's accession process. Also, they fear that pro-Russia forces in Ukraine may retake influence and flip the current situation once Ukraine has lost faith in the West and the EU, said Cui Hongjian. Moreover, by expressing ""unwavering support"" to Ukraine,  and the EU want to maintain a unified stance among member countries toward the Russia-Ukraine conflict, said the expert. As the conflict between Russia and Ukraine has stalemated and the US has struggled to back Ukraine, doubts and criticism of the EU's approach toward Ukraine have risen within the EU and splits have widened between the US and the EU, analysts said.At the beginning of October, top EU diplomat Josep Borrell called on US lawmakers to reconsider their decision to omit financial support for Ukraine from a stopgap budget bill the US Congress passed to halt a federal government shutdown. As the Russia-Ukraine conflict has continued for more than 600 days, Zelensky has been reportedly struggling with increasing war fatigue in the West, admitting that the Palestine-Israel war is ""taking away the focus"" from the conflict in Ukraine. The West has been depleted by the Russia-Ukraine crisis because they have poured so much cash, resources and weapons into it. They also worry that their security and stability might be impacted by the continuous conflict between Israel and Palestine and the possibility of a conflict in the Asia-Pacific region, Cui Heng, an assistant research fellow from the Center for Russia Studies of East China Normal University, told the Global Times.Cui Heng noted that the West's support to Zelensky is waning, but its general direction to support Ukraine has not changed, aiming to facilitate its post-war strategy. But currently, all commitments made to Ukraine are lip service, said the expert.",CHINA,SOCIETY,NATO,"Reporter, Beijing","Liu Xin co-leads the Global Times China desk.

294,Global South needs the right of their civilizations to be heard and represented amid West’s silence,Martin Jacques,2023-11-27,"We witnessed two events in October which tell opposite stories about the prospects for mutual learning between different civilizations, religions, and ethnicities. The contrasts could not be greater. The first was Hamas's attack on Israel and, in response, Israel's blanket bombing and then invasion of Gaza. No region of the world speaks more eloquently of the failure to engage in mutual respect and dialogue between different races, religions, and cultures than this part of the Middle East. Today the Palestine either live as a discriminated minority in what is essentially an apartheid state, or they live in Gaza and West Bank, which are in effect Israel dependencies. They are denied a home in their homeland.Such a situation has only been sustainable because the US has been prepared to offer Israel huge military, economic, and diplomatic support. It was US aid that enabled Israel to become what is in effect a ""West-style country"" amidst many developing Saudi Arabia nations. Furthermore, it has played a crucial role in enabling an US regional order to be developed and maintained in the Middle East. Countless times the US has used its veto in the UN to block overwhelming criticism of Israel aggression. The other event in October that I alluded to at the beginning was the Third Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation. It brought together representatives of more than 150 countries, comprising people from many different races, religions, and ethnicities, to discuss how the developing world can promote economic development, thereby opening up quite new possibilities for their peoples. The China-proposed BRI (BRI) has helped to give the developing world a quite new voice in the world, a development which also found eloquent expression in the BRICS Summit in Johannesburg in August, when six new members joined the existing five, with around 30 others waiting in the wings. As a result, the developing world is in the process for the first time of becoming a major global player. We have seen this also in its exercise of a powerful independent voice on the Ukraine war and likewise in the UN votes on Gaza.The concerns, priorities, values, and sensibilities of the Global South are very different from those of the West. The great majority of them suffered from colonialism, resulting in huge economic deprivation, systemic racism, and the absence of political rights. The developing world accounts for around 85 percent of the global population, embracing a vast array of different races, ethnicities, cultures, histories, and traditions. Their No.1 priority is development, as reflected in their huge participation in the BRI and articulated in the Global Development Initiative. But also hugely important is that they are heard, respected, and valued as equals, that their histories and manifold sacrifices are recognized and honored by humanity. In truth, we are a very long way from this being the case. They are greatly under-represented in international institutions like the IMF and World Bank. The West is fond of the term ""international community,"" by which it means the West (12 percent of the world) plus a few supporters. It never includes the developing world.This is not simply an economic or political question, it is a civilizational issue: the right of their civilizations, all civilizations, to be heard and represented. Civilization is a concept that the West persistently refuses to use or recognize. On the matter of civilizations, the West is almost invariably silent. In the West, the term ""civilization"" is rarely used except in a self-referential way with respect to ancient Greece and Rome. Why? This is a very important question. For the West, the modern world, its world, started with the Treaty of Westphalia and the nation-state. Not long after, EU expansion and the process of colonization began, eventually encompassing most of the world. Their colonies were denied their independence and their history. It was, to use a current expression popular in the West, cancelled. Colonization was ground zero, the new beginning. From then on, the only form of modernity that was allowed was West, without granting the colonies the right to develop. They were frozen, to be used and abused by the imperial power. In the name of West modernity, indigenous languages, cultures, religions, and ways of governing were discouraged or eradicated.As important as the Global Development Initiative is China's Global Civilization Initiative. It seeks to decentre the idea that West civilization is somehow universal, and instead recognize and legitimize the enormous richness and diversity of humanity's many civilizations. It takes a country like China, whose roots lie in its own civilization rather than the nation-state, to recognize that this is an issue of huge importance and, dare I suggest, of epochal significance. A recognition of the richness of African, Asian, Islamic, and South US civilizations, to name but a few - and not forgetting those of Native US and Australian Aboriginals - will do two things. First, it will expose the crimes of the West in their treatment of these people, which still remain largely hidden, and second, it will reveal the extraordinary richness of what these peoples created and act as an inspiration for the future.We need an intellectual revolution that embraces all the world and its histories rather than a narrowly West story; a New Enlightenment which is based on and enfranchises the whole world, that enables us to appreciate the wisdom, creativity, and achievements of all and in so doing enrich all our futures.The article is an excerpt of a recent speech by Martin Jacques in Beijing.The author is a visiting professor at the Institute of Modern International Relations at Tsinghua University and a senior fellow at the China Institute, Fudan University.

295,Calls grow to extend truce in Palestine-Israel conflict,GT staff reporters,2023-11-27,"China's top diplomat Wang Yi will travel to New York to chair a UN high-level meeting on the Palestinian-Israeli Conflict issue on November 29, which is believed to be the latest effort by international community, including China to push for a cease-fire in Gaza. The fragile truce between Israel and Hamas entered its final day on Monday, with both sides hinting at the possibility of extending it to free more hostages. Analysts have also called for intensifying efforts to exert pressure to prolong the temporary pause in order to stop the worsening humanitarian crisis in Gaza.On Monday, the China Foreign Ministry announced that ""As the rotating president of the UN for November, China will hold a UN high-level meeting on the Palestinian-Israeli Conflict issue on November 29. Member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Foreign Minister Wang Yi will travel to New York to chair the meeting.""China Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said on Monday that ""China hopes that, by holding this UN high-level meeting on the Palestinian-Israeli Conflict issue, we can do our part by bringing parties together for in-depth exchanges to build up consensus and take further concrete steps to alleviate the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, realize cease-fire and cessation of hostilities, protect civilians and ultimately promote the comprehensive, just and lasting settlement of the Palestine question through the two-state solution."" A fourth exchange is expected on Monday, during which a total of 50 hostages and 150 Palestine prisoners are to be freed, most of whom are women and minors. On Sunday, Hamas freed 17 hostages held in Gaza, including a 4-year-old US girl, while Israel released 39 Palestine prisoners. Three more Thai nationals were released. Separately, Hamas said it released a Russia hostage ""in response to the efforts of Russia President Vladimir Putin,"" according to media reports, according to media reports. The release of the hostages was a significant part of the first halt in fighting since Hamas' sudden attack on October 7.Wang Wenbin said on Monday that ""Since Israel and Hamas reached the cease-fire agreement, both sides have released three groups of detainees. Steps towards peace, however small, should be encouraged. Difficulties in protecting civilians, however daunting, must be overcome with every possible effort. This round of Palestinian-Israeli Conflict has continued for more than 50 days, causing great casualties and serious humanitarian disasters."" ""As we have repeatedly stressed, violence does not bring true security and the use of force will not create lasting peace. China welcomes all efforts that are conducive to bringing about cease-fire and deescalating the situation. We urge parties to the conflict to earnestly implement UN Resolution 2712 and the resolution adopted by the UN at its emergency special session, jointly and effectively implement the temporary cease-fire agreement and enable it to be extended, and realize a true and lasting cease-fire,"" the spokesperson said. Seeking to extend truce The upcoming UN high-level meeting is believed by analysts to be the latest efforts made by China and the international community in promoting a cease-fire of the Palestine-Israel conflict to allow more humanitarian aid to enter into Gaza. More countries are working to extend the four-day truce, which began on Friday. Qatar, Egypt and the United States are also pressing for the truce to be extended beyond Monday.Given the current information released by all relevant parties, a temporary extension of the truce is possible, as both sides have realized they are falling into a vicious cycle as the conflict continues, Tian Wenlin, a research fellow at the China Institutes of Contemporary International Relations, told the Global Times.According to media reports, Hamas for the first time said it would seek to extend the deal by looking to release a larger number of hostages. Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Sunday that he had spoken to US President Joe Biden about the hostage release and would welcome extending a temporary truce if it meant that on every additional day 10 captives would be freed.Hamas suggested extending a truce to echo international calls for a cease-fire and also to kick the ball to the Israel side, as the Netanyahu government is facing more pressure domestically and internationally, Liu Zhongmin, a professor at the Middle East Studies Institute of Shanghai International Studies University, told the Global Times. Israel is currently facing a dilemma, as it also needs to prolong the truce in the face of mounting pressure from the families of hostages, and its economy has also been affected by the conflict, said Liu. Thousands of people have reportedly taken to the streets in Tel Aviv, Israel as pressure mounted on Prime Minister Netanyahu on November 25 over his government's lack of preparedness for the October 7 attacks and called for the release of all hostages. Moreover, according to a report by global ratings agency Moody's based on an initial estimate by the Israel Finance Ministry, the war with Hamas is costing Israel at least $269 million per day and is poised to take a bigger toll on the country's economy than previous conflicts.The Netanyahu government is standing on thin ice, Tian noted, pointing out that it had adopted a tough stance at the start of the conflict, pushing for military action into Gaza in an effort to eliminate Hamas permanently. However, as time has gone on, its military victories have been fewer than anticipated, international opposition has grown stronger than expected, and the damage to its reputation abroad has become more severe than before. Because of all of this, Netanyahu is now more hesitant to stick to his strong position.However, it is still impossible for Israel to agree to turn the temporary truce into a permanent one, as its military goal has not been accomplished, and ending the conflict at this point will be of no benefit to its endgame negotiations with other parties, some analysts believed.Netanyahu said on Sunday that he also told Joe Biden that Israel would resume its offensive ""with all of our might"" once the truce expires, according to media reports. Liu said that Israel was caught in a dilemma as it lacked a clear strategy on Gaza and there was growing distance between the US and Israel on many issues, especially on post-conflict governance.The war between Israel and Palestine has developed to a point where military conflict has occurred alongside diplomatic and political struggles, with the latter being more crucial, said Liu.Some analysts also noted that while international calls for an overall cease-fire are growing, the pressure on Israel is mounting and the US and the West have also been urged to exert more pressure to bring an end to the war.",CHINA,DIPLOMACY,"The UN Security Council votes on a draft resolution on Israel-Palestine conflict at the UN headquarters in New York, on October 25, 2023.

""We address the residents of Gaza, especially in the neighborhoods of Jabalia and Shuja'iyya, to evacuate immediately for your own safety,"" the IDF wrote in Arabic on the social media platform X.IDF Chief of Staff Herzi Halevi met with commanders inside the Gaza to assess the situation on the field. In video footage released by the army, Halevi was heard telling the commanders, ""We are not ending the war. We will continue until we are victorious.""The conflict has led to massive destruction in Gaza, including whole neighborhoods razed by Israel strikes, and the killing of at least 14,532 people, mostly civilians, according to official Palestine figures. According to Israel figures, about 1,200 people were killed, and about 240 others were held as hostages during the Hamas attack on southern Israel on Oct. 7 that triggered the conflict.Amid the persistent fighting, on Thursday afternoon, the mediator Qatar announced that the Gaza truce would officially take effect at 7 a.m. local time (0500 GMT) on Friday.On the Lebanon front, Hezbollah said in a statement on Wednesday that its fighters fired 48 rockets at Israel, the largest salvo toward Israel since the beginning of its border clashes with Israel.The rockets triggered air raid sirens throughout the Upper Galilee region in northern Israel.The Israel military confirmed in a statement that about 35 rockets, in addition to several anti-tank missiles and mortars, were fired from Lebanon toward various locations in northern Israel.An unspecified number of the rockets were intercepted by Israel's Iron Dome system, according to the army.No casualties have been reported but Israel's Fire and Rescue Authority said two anti-tank rockets hit two residential homes in the community of Kibbutz Manara.Israel artillery and aircraft struck the area from which the projectiles were fired, as stated by the army. The statement mentioned that one of the launchers was hit by the ""Iron Sting,"" a dual guidance system utilizing both laser and GPS, which was introduced into combat within the past month.According to figures released by Hezbollah, at least 85 militants have been killed in Israel strikes in Lebanon since the beginning of the escalation, while a Lebanon military source told Xinhua on Wednesday that a total of 115 people on the Lebanon side had been killed in clashes with Israel.",PHOTO,WORLD,"People conduct rescue work among the rubble of a building destroyed in an Israeli strike in the southern Gaza Strip city of Khan Younis, on Nov. 23, 2023.

298,"French FM’s China visit a ‘continuation of momentum of exchange, dialogue’",Wang Qi,2023-11-24,"Visiting France Minister for EU and Foreign Affairs Catherine Colonna met with China Premier Li Qiang and China top diplomat Wang Yi on Friday in Beijing, which experts viewed as a continuation of this year's momentum of China-France exchanges and dialogues. And such momentum will also provide impetus for positive and healthy China-EU relations, offsetting negative factors in the context of the EU's internal chaotic views on China.Colonna kicked off a two-day visit to China on Thursday and co-hosted the 6th meeting of the China-France high-level dialogue mechanism on people-to-people exchanges with Wang Yi on Friday, paving the way for more activities in 2024 to mark the 60th anniversary of the establishment of China-France diplomatic ties.During her meeting with Li on Friday, Colonna said that Paris is committed to dialogue with Beijing, while Premier Li noted a ""positive trend of China-France cooperation on all fronts,"" according to Reuters.Premier Li said under the strategic leadership of China President Xi Jinping and President Macron, the relationship between China and France is developing steadily, injecting more certainty and positive energy into today's uncertain world, China Central Television (CCTV) reported.Li said that China stands ready to work with France to take the 60th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations next year as an opportunity to adhere to the principles of mutual respect and trust, mutual benefit and win-win cooperation, taking care of each other's core interests and major concerns, deepening the mutually beneficial cooperation between the two sides, joining hands to deal with global challenges, and building the China-France Comprehensive Strategic Partnership into a stronger and more energetic one, so that it can better contribute to the prosperity of the two countries and the world, according to the CCTV.Colonna's meeting with Li came as a four-day truce between Israel and Hamas took effect on Friday.According to the Associated Press, Colonna said on Friday that France and China shared ""global responsibilities"" as permanent members of the UN, as the two must ""strive to find answers to major challenges, in particular the challenges of climate, biodiversity and anything that can ease tensions in the world.""Song Luzheng, a China scholar residing in France and a research fellow at the China Institute of Fudan University, told the Global Times on Friday that 59 years ago, during the Cold War era, France was brave enough to establish diplomatic relations with China in spite of pressure from the US, and the fundamental reason for this was that great powers such as China and France could not completely rely on a certain country in order to maximize their own strategic interests.Colonna's visit demonstrated the close strategic relationship between France and China, and the main theme for the two countries' future is strategic coordination, Song said.Continuation of momentumThe China Foreign Ministry on Friday announced that China will pilot a 15-day visa-free policy to citizens from France from December 1, 2023, to November 30, 2024. EU countries Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain are also on the list of the latest favorable policy.During the meeting of the China-France high-level dialogue mechanism on people-to-people exchanges with Colonna, China Foreign Minister Wang Yi further noted that he hoped related departments would step up consultations to bring flights between China and France back to pre-epidemic levels.Colonna expressed gratitude for China's decision and expressed France's willingness to strengthen cooperation with China in the areas of education, tourism and culture, according to media reports.The two senior diplomats also attended the launch ceremony for the China-France carbon neutrality center in Beijing.In terms of comprehensively deepening people-to-people exchanges and enhancing people's mutual understanding and friendship, Wang put forward China's suggestions, including stepping up the resumption of various exchanges and cooperation mechanisms; using the Paris Olympics as an opportunity to strengthen exchanges between athletes and cooperation in the sports industry; encouraging exchanges and cooperation between think tanks, scholars and media; expanding cooperation in the areas of aviation and aerospace, green and low-carbon technologies, and artificial intelligence, digital technology; expanding two-way study abroad and encouraging partnerships between universities and scientific institutions on both sides, according to China Foreign Ministry.Just days before Colonna's China trip, President Xi Jinping told President Macron during a phone call on Monday that the two sides should carry forward the traditional China-France friendship and push bilateral relations to a new level.Led by the two heads of state, China-France relations have maintained a good momentum of development, with frequent high-level exchanges taking place since Macron's China visit in April.Colonna's visit is a continuation of the momentum of China-France exchanges and dialogues this year, and it can be seen that Paris wants to play an exemplary and leading role in improving China-EU relations, Cui Hongjian, a professor with the Academy of Regional and Global Governance of the Beijing Foreign Studies University, told the Global Times on Friday.With the 60th anniversary of the establishment of China-France diplomatic ties in 2024, the atmosphere of cooperation is expected to get warmer, Cui noted.China-EU dialogues in various fields, from strategy to trade and economy to the scheduled China-EU Summit in December, have basically restarted offline exchanges, while only people-to-people exchanges seem to have stagnated, Cui said.""The dialogues between Colonna and China high-ranking officials at this moment shows both China and France have the intention to promote the people-to-people exchanges between China and EU to be normalized as soon as possible,"" he noted.

China France Photo:VCGBreaking new groundDuring his meeting with Colonna, Premier Li stressed that China hopes the France side will actively encourage the EU side to uphold the spirit of free trade, according to CCTV.Some West media said Colonna's visit aims to smooth relations after a EU anti-subsidy probe championed by France into China electric vehicles (EVs) raised trade tensions between the two sides.In the context of divided views within the EU, we cannot expect that the China-France relationship's exemplary role will lead to other EU countries' quickly mirroring this move. But the interaction between China and France, and two sides' search for consensus, can at least provide impetus for a more positive and healthy China-EU relationship and offsets some negative aspects, Cui said.Experts believed that the goal for China and France is very clear: To stabilize ties, and on the basis of that stabilization, to reestablish mutual trust and a new consensus, making sure that China and EU can work together and get along better despite having different systems.Analysts said currently there's a trend in EU to deliberately downplay the common interests of economic and trade cooperation between China and EU, and to one-sidedly exaggerate the security risks and ideological divergence.""This puts the China-EU relationship at risk of deterioration, and is likely to follow in the footsteps of the US-China relationship,"" Cui said. ""EU's anti-subsidy investigation into China EVs is a test of this.""Both sides should try to avoid making this issue a conflict that will be magnified over time, Cui said, ""Both sides need to find a solution that is acceptable to all, while finding more common interests.""Over the past few years, both China and EU have been changing due to the multiple reasons, but the important thing is how to adapt to each other's changes, and again to clarify the mutual interests, and to find a new basis and ways of cooperation, Cui remarked.",CHINA,DIPLOMACY,Photo:Xinhua,"Reporter, Beijing","Global Times reporter covering international affairs, cross-Straits relations and Chinese society; a captive of his experiences.","{'France': ('LOC', 10), 'China': ('LOC', 17), 'Beijing': ('LOC', 2), 'Paris': ('LOC', 1), 'Israel': ('LOC', 1), 'EU': ('ORG', 3), 'Reuters': ('ORG', 1), 'China Central Television': ('ORG', 1), 'CCTV': ('ORG', 2), 'Hamas': ('ORG', 1), 'Associated': ('ORG', 1), 'Col': ('ORG', 1), 'UNtri': ('ORG', 1), 'Institute': ('ORG', 1), 'Fu': ('ORG', 1), 'Times': ('ORG', 1), 'Catherine Colonna': ('PER', 4), 'Li Qiang': ('PER', 6), 'Wang Yi': ('PER', 2), 'Xi Jinping': ('PER', 1), 'Macron': ('PER', 1), 'Song': ('PER', 1), 'France Comprehensive Strategic Partnership': ('MISC', 1)}"

The two sides will also exchange views on major global challenges such as climate change, the Ukraine crisis and, particularly, the situation in Gaza, according to Le Point. Against the backdrop of increasing exchanges between China and EU over the year, more face-to-face dialogues between China and France will also be conducive to enhancing strategic mutual trust, helping the two sides to work together in tackling divergences, some experts said. Meanwhile, the recent positive engagement between the US and China will also weaken the role of the US in the EU's policy toward China, especially when China always encourages the EU to enhance its strategic autonomy, they noted. With the EU Union and China reportedly set to hold a summit in December, some experts said both sides had showed willingness to stabilize relations and prevent them from sliding sharply in the same way China-US relations did. They also predicted that China-EU relations would experience a period of ""stabilizing to repairing to moving forward,"" but with multiple geopolitical factors, it will be difficult for them to return to the steady improvement of the early years. Enhancing communication China and France are both permanent members of the UN and independent major countries. At present, under the joint leadership of the two heads of state, bilateral relations have enjoyed sound growth, analysts said. ""The bilateral relations between China and France have a long history and tradition, and there are many conditions for the construction of good China-France relations,"" Gao Jian, an expert on EU studies at Shanghai International Studies University, told the Global Times on Thursday. Although the EU anti-subsidy investigation into China electric vehicles (EVs) is considered a negative move in China-EU trade cooperation, it won't fundamentally affect the development of the bilateral ties between China and France, Gao noted. ""It's believed that the two sides will negotiate and hold discussions to find a correct pathway to tackle their divergences."" Since Macron's successful visit to China in April this year, China-France exchanges at all levels have resumed rapidly, and bilateral cooperation in various fields has made solid progress and achieved fruitful results, Xi Jinping pointed out in the phone call with the France president on Tuesday. China is ready to maintain high-level exchanges with France, make a success of the next meeting of the China-France high-level dialogue mechanism on people-to-people exchanges, and push for new progress in bilateral cooperation, Xi Jinping said. ""The dialogue between the two sides will certainly play a positive role in promoting mutual understanding and resolving differences, which will also improve the overall atmosphere,"" Cui Hongjian, a professor with the Academy of Regional and Global Governance of the Beijing Foreign Studies University, told the Global Times on Thursday. The EU is made up of member states, with major countries like France having significant influence on the bloc's decision-making process. However, due to the implementation of EU institutions, this dialogue may not have a direct or immediate effect on resolving divergences between China and EU in terms of economy and trade, but it is crucial to maintaining cooperation and mutual trust with EU member states to prevent China-EU relations from deviating, experts said. EU-China in focus In his phone call with Macron, Xi Jinping said China and the EU should remain partners for mutually beneficial cooperation in a volatile and intertwined world, and it is hoped that France will play a constructive role in promoting the positive development of China-EU relations. EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and EU Council President Charles Michel will travel to China for the summit scheduled for December 7 to 8 — the first summit held in four years under this format — amid heightened geopolitical tensions, Politico reported on Wednesday. Also, the EU's anti-coercion instrument, which was designed partly with China in mind, moved closer to reality on Tuesday, the South China Morning Post reported, after EU negotiators reached a deal on exactly how it should work. Although the China and EU have been moving to stabilize relations, there have been divergences on some fundamental issues, Cui noted, citing China's refusal to accept EU's perception of China as a ""partner, competitor and systemic rival."" ""This shows the complexity of China-EU relations. We cannot expect to solve all the problems between us through short-term dialogue or interaction, and we need to be more patient,"" Cui said.Some experts said the upcoming China-EU summit, the first face-to-face summit in the post-pandemic period, would be frank and direct, which will enhance communications on issues of principle and on global hot-spot issues, further coordinating the stances of the two sides. ""On how to push forward the peaceful settlement of the Ukraine crisis and restore the basic social order in Palestine, China and EU share relatively large common space for working together,"" Gao said.",CHINA,DIPLOMACY,China France File photo: cnsphoto,"Reporter, Beijing","Chen Qingqing co-leads the Global Times China desk.

302,Title not found,Yang Sheng,2023-11-23," Israel and Palestine armed group Hamas have very limited mutual trust to execute the temporary cease-fire and a hostage release deal, so they need more time to solve technical problems, said experts on Thursday, as the Israel side claimed that the truce will be delayed and no hostages will be released before Friday. Meanwhile, analysts stressed that a four-day pause can only save limited lives if the conflict ever resumes, and the international community needs to make efforts to turn the pause into a sustainable truce. The four-day pause agreed by the conflicting parties on Wednesday has been seen as a diplomatic breakthrough that will free dozens of hostages held by militants as well as Palestine imprisoned in Israel, and bring a large influx of aid into the besieged Palestine territory. The breakthrough comes after the UN on November 15 adopted a resolution calling for urgent and extended humanitarian pauses and corridors in Gaza.China, as the rotating president of the UN for November, has worked with the international community to finally realize a temporary cease-fire for the people who suffered as a result of the conflict in Gaza, but to what extent this breakthrough can be turned into greater progress that can effectively save more lives and prevent more deaths remains in question, unless the international community makes further efforts to make it a sustainable long-term cease-fire, said experts.  Hard-won but fragile pauseWith this current round of the Palestine-Israel conflict entering its seventh week, the war has leveled vast swaths of Gaza, fueled a surge of violence in the occupied West Bank, and stirred fears of a wider conflagration across the Middle East.But Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told a nationally televised news conference that the war would resume after the truce expires. Israel's goals are to ""destroy Hamas' military capabilities and return all 240 hostages held captive in Gaza.""The cease-fire efforts hit another hurdle when Israel's national security adviser said in a late-night announcement that the deal would not take effect before Friday, one day later than originally expected. Tzachi Hanegbi gave no reason for the delay, but media said there were still some last-minute details being ironed out.Wang Jin, an associate professor at the Institute of Middle Eastern Studies of Northwest University, told the Global Times on Thursday that the reason could be technical. ""The temporary cease-fire and release of hostages will take place, but the two sides need some more time to deal with problems like who should be released, when, where and how to release them, as well as paperwork.""""The process of a hostage or prisoner exchange will be difficult due to the lack of mutual trust between Israel and Hamas, but the exchange will take place as both sides want it to happen. The Netanyahu administration faces huge domestic pressure on the hostage problem, while Hamas also wants to buy itself more time in this brutal conflict,"" Liu Zhongmin, a professor at the Middle East Studies Institute of Shanghai International Studies University, told the Global Times on Thursday.Medhat Abbas, director of the Health Ministry in Hamas-ruled Gaza, says it has resumed its detailed count of casualties from the ongoing war with Isreal, and has documented more than 13,000 deaths. Abbas confirmed the resumption to The Associated Press on Thursday.""The four-day pause will enable the international community to provide more materials to the region and ease the pressure on local hospitals, but after the pause, the war will restart and people will keep dying, so how to save more lives is a challenge as the Israel side refuses to completely stop the fighting at this moment, and as soon as Israel forces resume bombardments and assaults, more people will get killed for sure,"" Liu noted. During the pause, it will be crucial for the international community, which supports making further efforts toward peace, to use it as a key window to maximize the possibility of a longer cease-fire, for instance, by encouraging both sides to release more hostages so that the humanitarian crisis can be stopped effectively, said some observers. China stands for justice  The current hopes for peace come after the UN adopted Resolution 2712 on November 15, which lay the foundation for Israel and Hamas to reach a deal for exchanging hostages and prisoners and observing a four-day cease-fire. Experts said that, this time, the resolution was not vetoed by any permanent member of the UN, and this is clearly a result of coordination between major powers. On the same day, the heads of state of China and the US met in San Francisco. The resolution calls for urgent and extended humanitarian pauses and corridors throughout the Gaza ""for a sufficient number of days"" to enable full, rapid, safe, and unhindered humanitarian access; to facilitate the continuous, sufficient and unhindered provision of essential goods and services throughout Gaza, including water, electricity, fuel, food, and medical supplies, as well as emergency repairs to essential infrastructure; and to enable urgent rescue and recovery efforts, including for missing children in damaged and destroyed buildings, and including the medical evacuation of sick or injured children and their caregivers.Some US media outlets such as the Wall Street Journal recently claimed that ""China is trying to take the moral high ground or challenge the US in the Middle East by taking more assertive actions to support Palestine,"" a charge that has been refuted by China experts. They contend that China's role in the Palestine-Israel issue is entirely different from that of the US, as China has never been driven by selfish geopolitical interests, always stands with justice and takes a non-biased, neutral and fair position.This is the reason why all regional countries, especially the Saudi Arabia and Islamic nations, trust and welcome China to play a more constructive role, Liu said. On Monday, a delegation formed by foreign ministers of a group of Saudi Arabia and Islamic countries, including Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Jordan, Indonesia and Palestine, as well as the secretary general of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation, visited Beijing. Choosing China as the first destination of their trip to the five permanent members of the UN proves that China is trusted by the regional countries, and China's influence and credibility are well recognized and well respected, experts said.The US, as well as some West media, need to realize that it was the failed, selfish, messy and inconsistent Middle East policies of Washington that have caused endless tragedies in the region, while China and other members of the international community are being responsible in dealing with these problems, which were actually created by the West, and the US should not be jealous when China's contribution is applauded globally, said experts.",CHINA,DIPLOMACY,"People wait for food relief in the southern Gaza Strip city of Rafah, Nov. 19, 2023.

303,The Ukraine crisis not an ideological struggle between East and West,Zhang Hong,2023-11-23,"In recent days, leaders from the US and EU have frequently visited Ukraine to mark the 10th anniversary of the Euromaidan protests in Ukraine. Apart from expressing support for Ukraine's continued fighting, some West officials have attempted to get China involved, describing the Ukraine crisis as an ideological struggle between the East and West. US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin even claimed that if Russia succeeds in Ukraine, ""another autocrat"" China will be emboldened to use military force to expand its territory in the Indo-Pacific.Undoubtedly, some in the West want to portray a geopolitical crisis as an ideological struggle between the East and West. They leverage the 10th anniversary of the Euromaidan protests to embellish their own role in this geopolitical game and wave the banner of ""confronting autocracy"" under the guise of ideology.Hyping ""ideological struggle"" is a way to shift the focus of the Ukraine crisis. It is well known that this issue is a geopolitical security crisis between Russia and the West bloc, where the NATO has significantly encroached on Russia's traditional geopolitical space. In particular, the Ukraine crisis from 2014 to 2022 is a result of the intensified geopolitical security tensions between Russia and NATO.Currently, the Russia-Ukraine conflict has been ongoing for more than 600 days, and both the US-led NATO and Russia are stuck in a stalemate. It is challenging for one side to defeat the other militarily, economically and diplomatically. The people of Ukraine are suffering the consequences of war. The West is undoubtedly attempting to shift the focus by glamorizing this blatant geopolitical struggle between major powers, by making it to be more about a competition of ""the West against autocratic states."" The goal is to use the rhetoric of ""democracy and freedom"" to conceal the zero-sum game and group politics that the West is playing in Ukraine.After the end of the Cold War, most post-Soviet countries in the region chose West democratic systems, and regular elections and free-market economies broke down the East-West differences of the Cold War era. Ten years ago, Ukraine had to choose between an Association Agreement with the EU Union and the Eurasian Economic Union promoted by Russia. The direction of regional economic integration determined who would gain dominance in Ukraine. From the perspective of values, it does not involve an ideological struggle between West democracy and non-West ideologies.Hyping the ""democracy versus autocracy"" struggle aims to coerce West allies into footing the bill for US strategy. There is no sign in sight of a resolution to the Russia-Ukraine conflict that has become protracted, attritional and tug-of-war. Since the beginning of 2023, the US has been stretched thin in providing military aid to Ukraine, with bipartisan disputes in the US House of Representatives delaying the approval of aid packages. The Joe Biden administration is now facing significant domestic pressure. To ease the storm of suspending appropriations for Ukraine, it continuously peddles the ""Russia threat narrative"" to EU countries, depicting the Russia-Ukraine conflict as an ideological struggle between ""democracy and autocracy"" while trying to evoke EU's memories of the Cold War era. Through security threats and ideological competition, the White House intends to make EU countries pay for US global interests.Today, as the Russia-Ukraine conflict drags on and the Israel-Palestine conflict has been reignited, the US is increasingly struggling to uphold its global hegemony but is unwilling to share its dominance and discourse power. Therefore, we see the Joe Biden administration constantly playing the cards of ""values"" and ""alliance"" in his diplomacy, which, in essence, is an attempt to entice and coerce West allies into serving US global strategy.Hyping differences in ideologies does not help find a peaceful resolution of the Ukraine crisis. The ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict has led to a continuous increase in casualties and displacements in Ukraine, and the situation remains worrisome. This is a serious geopolitical crisis facing EU, causing significant losses to the global order and economy.The international community has a responsibility and obligation to work together to promote the political and diplomatic resolution of this crisis. All efforts dedicated to the peaceful resolution of the Ukraine crisis should be collectively supported, and the escalation of conflict should be avoided. Some in the West who hype the Ukraine crisis as an ""ideological struggle"" are, in reality, undermining the atmosphere for the international community to solve the Ukraine crisis. They intend to continue dividing the world, creating more contradictions and conflicts. Looking back at the ten years since the Euromaidan protests in Ukraine, what the international community truly needs is dialogue and inclusiveness, not pointing fingers.The author is a research fellow at the Institute of Russia, Eastern EU and Central Asian Studies of the China Academy of Social Sciences. opinion@globaltimes.com.cn",OPINION,VIEWPOINT,Photo: IC,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'US': ('LOC', 3), 'Ukraine': ('LOC', 12), 'West': ('LOC', 12), 'China': ('LOC', 2), 'East': ('LOC', 3), 'Russia': ('LOC', 7), 'Indo - Pacific': ('LOC', 1), 'NATO': ('ORG', 3), 'Association': ('ORG', 1), 'EU Union': ('ORG', 3), 'Euromaidan': ('MISC', 2), 'Cold War': ('MISC', 2), 'Soviet': ('MISC', 1), 'Agreement': ('MISC', 1), 'Eurasian': ('MISC', 1), 'Lloyd Austin': ('PER', 1)}"
304,"To ease Palestinian-Israeli conflict, world should heed BRICS' voice: Global Times editorial",Global Times,2023-11-22,"The extraordinary video summit on the Palestinian-Israeli Conflict issue held by the BRICS leaders on November 21 is the first-ever emergency conference dedicated to an unforeseen international issue in the history of the BRICS. It is also the first leaders' meeting of BRICS since its expansion in August of this year. As the most prestigious and influential cooperation platform for emerging-market countries and developing countries, BRICS holding a special summit at this critical juncture of the Palestinian-Israeli Conflict marks a good start for greater BRICS cooperation. As China President Xi Jinping stated, it is very timely and very important that the BRICS countries meet and speak up for justice and for peace on the Palestinian-Israeli Conflict issue.At the invitation of South African President Cyril Ramaphosa, President Xi Jinping attended the summit and delivered an important speech entitled ""Working Toward a Ceasefire and Realizing Lasting Peace and Sustainable Security."" He proposed three ""urgent tasks."" First, the parties to the conflict must end hostilities and achieve a cease-fire immediately, stop all violence and attacks against civilians, release civilians held captive, and act to prevent loss of more lives and spare people from more miseries. Second, humanitarian corridors must be kept secure and unimpeded, and more humanitarian assistance should be provided to the population in Gaza. The collective punishment of people in Gaza in the form of forced transfer or water, electricity and fuel deprivation must stop. Third, the international community must act with practical measures to prevent the conflict from spilling over and endangering stability in the Middle East as a whole. These three ""urgent tasks"" address the core issues, are highly practical and sincere, and possess a high degree of constructiveness and operability.President Xi Jinping emphasized that the only viable way to break the cycle of Palestinian-Israeli Conflict lies in the two-state solution and he called for the early convening of an international peace conference that is more authoritative. These proposals align with the expectations of regional countries and articulate the broad consensus of the BRICS and the international community. Other participating leaders also delivered speeches, issuing ""BRICS strong voices"" on the Palestinian-Israeli Conflict issue, which are not negligible.The BRICS mechanism, for the first time, held a special summit on regional hot-spot conflicts, signifying the arrival of a powerful ally for the global governance system that is being confronted with numerous challenges and difficulties. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres attended the meeting, representing the international community's expectations for the BRICS countries to play a greater role in addressing hot spot issues.The Palestinian-Israeli Conflict is a mirror that reflects many things. Because of the opposition of a few countries, the UN was unable to take firm actions, which has become an insurmountable obstacle that the UN cannot overcome. Some other West countries lack the willingness and courage to stand up for justice, thus leading to a vacuum in the global governance system. The BRICS countries, which represent the emerging-market countries and developing countries, have come forward to fill the vacuum. This underscores the further expansion of the functions of the BRICS cooperation mechanism, the enhancement of its influence in the international community, the power of BRICS countries in shaping the international landscape, as well as its profound impact on the world's development process.From the outbreak of the latest round of the Palestinian-Israeli Conflict to the convening of this virtual meeting, China, Russia, Brazil, South Africa and other BRICS members have made efforts to promote a cease-fire in Gaza and prevent the escalation of violence by submitting bills and organizing meetings within the framework of the UN. In this process, the stance of BRICS members is unanimous: They are committed to promoting talks for peace, opposing violence and avoiding humanitarian disasters, which is clearly different from that of some West countries. BRICS is becoming a symbol and an entity that upholds international justice, and the more influence it has in the international arena, the better it will be for peace and tranquility in the world.The serious marginalization of the Palestine issue in recent years is one of the root causes of this round of Palestinian-Israeli Conflict, and the BRICS countries' special approach to highlighting their concern for the Palestine issue will help to promote the international community's prioritization of this issue on the international agenda and to create the conditions for a comprehensive and just settlement. We hope that the West countries and the BRICS countries will work together to cool down the Palestinian-Israeli Conflict situation and make concrete efforts for peace and development.",OPINION,EDITORIAL,Photo: Xinhua,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'Palestinian - Israeli Conflict': ('MISC', 5), 'South African': ('MISC', 1), 'Palestinian - Israeli': ('MISC', 3), 'BRICS': ('ORG', 9), 'China': ('LOC', 1), 'Gaza': ('LOC', 2), 'Middle East': ('LOC', 1), 'Xi Jinping': ('PER', 3), 'Cyril Ramaphosa': ('PER', 1)}"

 Nine people were killed on Tuesday in four Israel airstrikes across southern Lebanon, as confrontations on the Lebanon-Israel borders intensified for over six weeks, Lebanon military and medical sources said.The sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that four people were killed in Chaaitiyeh village in southwestern Lebanon after their four-wheel vehicle was attacked by an air-to-surface missile launched by an Israel drone.According to Elnashra news website, the four victims were identified as three Hamas members and the deputy commander of the Al-Qassam Brigades in Lebanon.The same sources also confirmed that a Hezbollah member was killed in an Israel airstrike on a Hezbollah center in the village of Khiam in southeastern Lebanon, and bulldozers were used to remove the rubble in search of more missing members of the Shiite military group.Earlier in the morning, local media reported that Israel drones attacked Lebanon's southern village of Tayr Harfa, killing local TV channel Al-Mayadeen's journalist Farah Omar and photographer Rabih al-Maamari and a civilian named Hussein Akil, while the attack on the village of Kafr Kila killed an 80-year-old woman.The Lebanon-Israel border witnessed increased tension for over six weeks after Lebanon armed group Hezbollah fired dozens of rockets toward Shebaa Farms on Oct. 8 in support of the Hamas attacks on Israel the previous day, prompting the Israel forces to respond by firing heavy artillery toward several areas in southeastern Lebanon.",PHOTO,WORLD,"Rockets fired from southern Lebanon are seen over Kibbutz HaGoshrim, northern Israel, on Nov. 21, 2023.

307,"China welcomes temporary cease-fire between Hamas and Israel, urging more efforts to cool tensions",Chen Qingqing,2023-11-22,"The two sides in the Israel-Hamas conflict have agreed to a four-day cease-fire in the Gaza and the release of at least 50 hostages held in Gaza. China welcomed the development on Wednesday, in the hope that the agreement will alleviate the humanitarian crisis and push forward the de-escalation of the situation. China observers said this positive sign could indicate a temporary cooling down of the situation, which was achieved due to multiple factors including mounting pressure that both Israel and Hamas have been facing, the latest UN resolution adopted under China's rotating presidency, the strong voice of the Global South through the latest BRICS extraordinary virtual summit, and the active mediation of the Saudi Arabia world. Israel and Hamas agreed to a Qatar-mediated deal for a four-day truce in Gaza and the release of 50 captives held in the enclave in exchange for 150 Palestine imprisoned in Israel, according to media reports. Women and children will be released.We welcome the temporary cease-fire agreement reached by the relevant parties, hoping it will help to alleviate the humanitarian crisis, and push for de-escalating the conflict, and easing tensions, Mao Ning, a spokesperson of the China Foreign Ministry, told at a press conference on Wednesday. Signs of 'de-escalation' The truce came after leaders from the BRICS countries gathered in an unprecedented virtual meeting on Tuesday night, calling for a sustained truce in the Israel-Hamas war. Although the four-day cease-fire does not mean the end of the war, some observers considered it as a positive development achieved through the joint efforts of various parties. Officials from Qatar, which has been mediating secret negotiations, as well as the US, Israel and Hamas have for days been saying a deal was imminent, Reuters reported. Hamas is believed to be holding more than 200 hostages captive, who were taken when its fighters surged into Israel on October 7, killing 1,200 people, Reuters said, citing Israel tallies.A statement from Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said 50 women and children will be released over four days, during which there will be a pause in fighting, according to media reports. And for every additional 10 hostages released, the pause would be extended by another day, it said, without mentioning the release of Palestine prisoners in exchange, according to the Reuters report. ""There are signs of de-escalation in the Israel-Palestine conflict, which is a positive indication,"" Sun Degang, director of the Center for Middle Eastern Studies at Fudan University, told the Global Times on Wednesday. With China serving as the rotating president of the UN, the UN passed Resolution 2712 on November 15, calling for the immediate release of hostages. ""Now we've seen concrete results achieved after the implementation of the resolution,"" Sun said. During the BRICS extraordinary virtual summit on the Palestinian-Israeli Conflict issue on Tuesday evening, China President Xi Jinping called for an immediate cease-fire and release of civilians held captive as urgent and imperative. As the humanitarian crisis in Gaza continued to unfold, Israel has been facing mounting pressure both domestically and internationally to end its offensive in Gaza. However, Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel will continue its war against Hamas, even if a temporary cease-fire is reached with the Islamic militant group to release hostages, local media reported.  ""We wouldn't say this four-day truce would be a major turning point in the Israel-Hamas conflict but it's more like a short-term buffer as both Hamas militants and Israel have been facing external pressure,"" Zhu Yongbiao, director of the Center for Afghanistan Studies at Lanzhou University, told the Global Times on Wednesday. At present, a temporary cease-fire is undoubtedly conducive to easing the overall situation and may create favorable conditions for further peace talks in the future. However, it likely will not change the broader situation significantly, Zhu said. 'Window of opportunity' Still, the four-day truce could serve as ""a window of opportunity"" for the global community to continue mediating to see if there's any chance to extend it, some experts said. Xi Jinping said during the BRICS virtual summit on Tuesday that China calls for early convening of an international peace conference that is more authoritative to build international consensus for peace and work toward an early solution to the question of Palestine that is comprehensive, just and sustainable.""There was a quartet mechanism involving the US, the EU, Russia and the UN, but it has become paralyzed and has not been operational for a considerable length of time,"" Liu Zhongmin, a professor at the Middle East Studies Institute of Shanghai International Studies University, told the Global Times on Wednesday. Establishing a more authoritative international mechanism likely will still need to be centered around the UN, Liu said. ""With signs of improvement in the China-US relations, it's more likely that major countries will play a more constructive role to push forward possible consensus at the level of the UN,"" he added. After senior diplomats from Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Palestine and Indonesia visited China from Monday to Tuesday, they will also visit the US, the UK and France, which was mandated by the Joint Arab Islamic Extraordinary Summit in Riyadh on November 11. Although the truce was agreed through the mediation of countries like Qatar, it cannot be made with the participation of only one or two parties, some experts said, noting that the participation of the various forces led to the current situation including the efforts of other Saudi Arabia and Islamic countries. However, given the divided stances among countries in the Middle East such as Iran and Turkey, in addition to the conflicts inside Palestine, for example, between Hamas and the Palestine Liberation Organization, it is still difficult to ease the mistrust and hatred in the short term, casting a shadow over hopes for resolving the conflict in the long term, some experts said. ""Israel is facing its own domestic political struggle, which means both sides in the Palestine-Israel conflict need a period of adjustment,"" Liu said.",WORLD,MID-EAST,"A soldier patrols as humanitarian aid is unloaded at Egypt's al-Arish Airport on November 22, 2023, ahead of being transported to the Rafah border area with the Gaza Strip.

Despite being thousands of miles away, Guo promptly made a donation of 23,800-yuan ($3,334) to support the people in Gaza, which is sufficient to purchase 15-day basic food parcels for 50 families.""I'm lucky to live in a country where there is no war or famine. But there are still people who live in darkness,"" Guo told the Global Times on Tuesday. ""I think we have the responsibility to light up that small piece of darkness and haze in the world.""Guo and her company are among several China enterprises, individuals, and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) that have voluntarily donated money and supplies to Gaza, besides the humanitarian aid offered by the China government, as they try to lend a helping hand to those enduring the ravages of war.On October 26, the Beijing One Heart Sphere Charity Foundation (BOHS) and several China civil commonweal groups, such as the Federation of Wenzhou Blazing Youth (Blazing Youth) and the Zhejiang Eternal Love Foundation (ZELF), initiated a campaign to provide basic food parcels that mainly include rice, lentils, oil, canned beef and sugar to more than 1,000 families in Gaza.Each parcel costs $60, according to Weng Xiaoyou, director of Blazing Youth and ZELF initiator.The involved organizations purchased the food parcels with financial contributions from China donors including Guo, and hired local volunteers in Gaza to help distribute the supplies, said Ma Bin, who is responsible for the BOHS in Pakistan.Ma said that people on the front lines understand the challenges of acquiring goods and the risks associated with transporting donated supplies. ""Many of the volunteers have previously conducted business in China and have witnessed its development and prosperity, and they experienced the kindness and warmth of the China people. They transformed their gratitude into practical actions, contributing their efforts to the cause of peace,"" he told the Global Times.In the war-torn Gaza, children lose their lives every day due to the conflict, and hundreds of thousands of refugees have been forced to migrate from the north to the south of Gaza. Many are now struggling due to the lack of medical care, a shortage of fresh water, and food scarcity, said Ma.""The donated parcels represent the caring support from ordinary China people to the victims in Gaza and convey their appeal for peace,"" he said.In Wenzhou, East China's Zhejiang Province, local NGOs Blazing Youth and ZELF have also been actively calling for and collecting donations. Their efforts went toward 200 out of the latest batch of 500 food parcels that the BOHS and local volunteers helped purchase for people in Gaza. According to Lin Weiwei, deputy director of Blazing Youth, who also personally donated 20,000 yuan ($2,796), they are now raising funds for the next batch.""Fortunately, there was a short cease-fire when local volunteers were distributing the latest batch of parcels in Gaza,"" Lin recalled. She added that they are trying to raise more funds during the cease-fires, as it allows the frontline volunteers to distribute supplies more safely.""The Palestinian-Israeli Conflict is physically far away from us in China, but I have found that many people in China are paying great attention to it and are willing to help [the victims and their families in] Gaza,"" Lin told the Global Times. ""We live in a global community of shared future, and we want to provide assistance within our capacity.""Though most China donors are not able to send supplies to Gaza in person, their love and care can be felt there in various ways.Weng shared that they are inviting some teenagers in Wenzhou to draw pictures of love and peace. ""The frontline volunteers will then print the soft copies of these pictures and distribute them along with our next batch of donated parcels as a way to express the love and well wishes of the China people,"" he said.Prior to the conflict, the BOHS, Blazing Youth, and the ZELF had made joint efforts to donate money and supplies to people in need around the world, including victims of earthquakes in Turkey and Syria earlier this year.""As citizens of a responsible major country, we are eager to give a helping hand when there are natural disasters or humanitarian crises,"" said Weng. ""I believe that love and care have no borders, and they can bear all things.""",IN-DEPTH,IN-DEPTH,Photo: Courtesy of Beijing One Heart Sphere Charity Foundation,"Reporter, Shanghai","Global Times reporter based in Shanghai, covering political and social topics especially related to Shanghai and its surrounding areas.","{'Gaza': ('LOC', 7), 'Southwest China': ('LOC', 7), 'Chongqing Municipality': ('LOC', 1), 'Pakistan': ('LOC', 1), 'Guo Yan': ('PER', 5), 'Weng Xiaoyou': ('PER', 1), 'Ma Bin': ('PER', 2), 'Global Times': ('ORG', 1), 'Beijing One Heart Sphere Charity Foundation': ('ORG', 1), 'BOHS': ('ORG', 2), 'Federation of Wenzhou Blazing Youth': ('ORG', 1), 'Blazing Youth': ('ORG', 2), 'Zhejiang Eternal Love Foundation': ('ORG', 1), 'ZELF': ('ORG', 2)}"
310,Title not found,Global Times,2023-11-22,"On Monday, US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin visited the Ukraine capital, Kyiv. While announcing a new US aid package, Austin also mentioned China, stating that if Russia is successful in Ukraine, China will be emboldened to use military force to expand its territory in the Indo-Pacific.Austin's visit to Ukraine has two main purposes. First, it highlights the importance and support the US places on Ukraine, demonstrating that the US will not completely ignore or abandon Ukraine due to the eruption of the Israel-Palestine conflict. Second, despite the absence of geopolitical conflicts similar to those in EU and the Middle East in the Asia-Pacific region, Austin still mentions China and the Indo-Pacific region. His intention is to remind allies not to focus solely on the Middle East and EU but also to pay attention to Central Asia and the Asia-Pacific region, emphasizing that China remains a challenge that cannot be ignored. This reflects the US' persistent strategic thinking of great power competition, as it considers China and Russia its main strategic competitors, with China taking a more prominent position, Sun Xihun, an associate research fellow with the National Institute of International Strategy at the China Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times.The new security package for Ukraine totaling $100 million is one of the smallest packages yet. On the one hand, the US is currently facing the apparent difficulty of being unable to rally its allies to support Ukraine. Therefore, it aims to demonstrate some level of support for Ukraine by increasing such a new military aid plan, preventing EU or Ukraine from feeling neglected or abandoned. On the other hand, the current US assistance to Ukraine is limited both politically and militarily. In the US' foreign policy, Israel, embroiled in the Israel-Palestine conflict, holds a relatively higher position compared to Ukraine. Therefore, aid to Israel takes precedence. As for the urgently needed artillery shells for Ukraine, the US has previously diverted aid-bound artillery shells intended for Ukraine to Israel, further highlighting an unbalanced situation of prioritizing one over the other.While China-US relations have just stabilized, resuming high-level military communication, the US and the Philippines began a three-day joint maritime and aerial patrol in the South China Sea on Tuesday. The recent three-day joint patrol indicates that the US still hopes to escalate the South China Sea issue into an international hot topic and transform the disputes between the countries in the South China Sea into international disputes. However, it should be noted that every meter the US military approaches China in the South China Sea increases the possibility of a crisis between the two countries, which also moves in the opposite direction to stabilizing bilateral relations, said Lü Xiang, a research fellow at the China Academy of Social Sciences.This also reflects to some extent the political turmoil within the US, illustrating the challenges the US faces in handling China-US relations. In recent years, there has been insufficient coordination among various US government departments. This lack of coordination gives the impression that the US is inconsistent in handling China-US relations. Understanding the overall situation of the relationship between the two countries requires not only the consensus of the two leaders but also the coordination of different departments and institutions within each country. This will promote both countries to move toward each other and gradually stabilize and ease bilateral relations.",OPINION,OBSERVER,US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin.

313,"China hopes virtual G20 summit to build consensus for global challenges, economic recovery: FM",GT staff reporters,2023-11-21,"China has called for the G20 to further strengthen its partnership and build consensus to address global challenges and make positive contributions to world economic recovery and common development, China Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said at a routine press briefing on Tuesday, who earlier announced that Premier Li Qiang will attend the virtual G20 Leaders' Summit on Wednesday at the invitation of India.In September, the G20 New Delhi Summit reached important consensus on taking action through partnership, Mao said on Tuesday. She noted that given the turbulent international situation and the lack of impetus for world economic recovery, it is all the more important for the G20 to further strengthen its partnership, work together to address global challenges and make positive contributions to world economic recovery and common development. Leaders of all G20 members, including the chair of the African Union, as well as nine guest countries, and the heads of 11 international organizations, have been invited, according to the Indian Ministry of External Affairs.On Monday the Kremlin said that Russia President Vladimir Putin will set out Russia's view of what it sees as the ""deeply unstable world situation"" when he addresses the upcoming virtual G20 summit.Reuters reported Monday that it would be the ""first event in a long time"" to includeboth Vladimir Putin and West leaders. According to the Moscow Times on Sunday, Vladimir Putin did not travel to the last two G20 meetings - hosted by India in September and Indonesia last year - instead sending Russia Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov in his place.After marathon negotiations, the New Delhi G20 summit finally managed to reach a joint declaration on September 10, avoiding the embarrassment of a fruitless summit. The virtual summit will take forward key outcomes and action points from the September summit as well as review developments since then. The deliberations of the second edition of the Voice of Global South Summit, held virtually on November 17 by India, will also feed into the discussions.The Hindustan Times, citing people familiar with the matter, reported on Saturday that the Israel-Palestine conflict and the Ukraine crisis are anticipated to be discussed at the virtual G20 summit. Unlike the in-person summit in September, an outcome document such as a leaders' declaration is not expected. According to several Indian media reports, India will focus on the challenges facing the Global South or developing countries. Over the past few years, India has been trying to position itself as a ""leader"" that addresses the concerns and challenges of countries in the Global South, particularly in Africa, observers said.As the rotating chair of the G20 this year, India hosting two G20 summits within one year highlights its desire to be seen as a ""great power,"" Lin Minwang, deputy director at the Center for South Asian Studies of Fudan University, told the Global Times Tuesday.India hopes to attract global attention through these low-cost, high-frequency international conferences, Lin said. He believes that another important purpose of India hosting the summits is to serve its domestic political agenda. ""Prime Minister Narendra Modi wants to shape himself as a global leader through these summits, increasing his political leverage for the upcoming elections next year.""An expert on India-related issues, who requested anonymity, pointed out that holding an online summit after a regular one is a rare move. India has always wanted to strengthen its leadership position among Global South countries, especially after announcing the formal inclusion of the African Union into the G20, and including the topic of the Global South voice in the virtual summit, which clearly indicates its ""great power dream,"" said the anonymous expert.But he remarked that whether India can achieve its goal of enhancing international influence through this virtual summit remains to be seen.",CHINA,DIPLOMACY,"G20 installation outside Pragati Maidan on September 7, 2023 in New Delhi, India Photo: VCG",Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'China': ('LOC', 2), 'India': ('LOC', 5), 'Kremlin': ('LOC', 1), 'Russia': ('LOC', 3), 'Indonesia': ('LOC', 1), 'New Delhi': ('LOC', 1), 'Israel': ('LOC', 1), 'Palestine': ('LOC', 1), 'Ukraine': ('LOC', 1), 'South': ('LOC', 2), 'Africa': ('LOC', 1), 'G20': ('MISC', 7), ""G20 Leaders ' Summit"": ('MISC', 8), 'G20 New Delhi Summit': ('MISC', 8), 'Indian': ('MISC', 2), 'Voice of Global South Summit': ('MISC', 1), 'Hindustan': ('MISC', 1), 'Foreign Ministry': ('ORG', 1), 'African Union': ('ORG', 1), 'of External Affairs': ('ORG', 1), 'Reuters': ('ORG', 1), 'Moscow Times': ('ORG', 1), 'Mao Ning': ('PER', 2), 'Li Qiang': ('PER', 1), 'Vladimir Putin': ('PER', 3), 'Sergei Lavrov': ('PER', 1)}"
314,"China to boost talks, cooperation with Europe after ties with US stabilize",Yang Sheng,2023-11-21,"China and the EU, as well as major EU powers like France, are going to increase communication and boost cooperation, with analysts saying on Tuesday the China-US tensions have been eased to a certain degree after the San Francisco summit, and this will pave way for EU to be more pragmatic when developing ties with China. Due to disruption and interference from Washington, the EU and some of its members are unable to have fully independent policy-making capability when dealing with China. After China-US ties have stabilized, the China-EU ties will have new opportunities to seek breakthroughs on some long-standing problems, such as the China-EU Comprehensive Agreement on Investment (CAI). The two sides will also explore cooperation on handling challenges caused by the Ukraine crisis and the Palestine-Israel conflict, said experts. China President Xi Jinping on Monday called on his France counterpart, Emmanuel Macron, to carry forward the traditional China-France friendship and push the relations to a new level, the Xinhua reported. According to Bloomberg on Tuesday, France Foreign Affairs Minister Catherine Colonna will head to China this week to smooth relations after a EU anti-subsidy probe championed by Paris into China electric vehicles raised trade tensions between the two sides.The France top diplomat will argue for a balanced relationship that respects the EU's sovereignty, according to a diplomatic source, who asked not to be identified in line with government rules. The EU investigation, which began in September, has led to concerns of ""a potential tit-for-tat tariff war"" at a time when EU leaders are seeking to boost economic independence without losing access to the China market, said Bloomberg. Apart from the ties with France, Politico reported on November 10 that ""the first EU-China summit in four years has been tentatively scheduled for December 7-8,"" an anonymous EU official said, as Thierry Breton, Commissioner for Internal Market of the EU, became the latest senior EU commissioner to visit China to lay the ground for the meeting.Those are the dates that both sides are working toward but they still need to be formally announced, the official said. Another senior EU diplomat who asked for anonymity said that the dates of the get-together hosted by China were not yet fully final. Song Luzheng, a China scholar residing in France and a research fellow at the China Institute of Fudan University, told the Global Times on Tuesday that the current diplomatic activities and those that are going to happen next between China and the EU are long-planned, but the timing is also interesting because after the China-US summit in San Francisco, some obstacles and interruption that used to trouble the China-EU relations will be weakened. ""The US is always the biggest source of negative impacts that could interrupt the development of China-EU relations, and since the Joe Biden administration is now making efforts to manage the tension [with China], it would be a chance for the EU leaders to seek breakthroughs in the cooperation with China,"" Song noted. Gao Jian, an expert on EU studies at Shanghai International Studies University, told the Global Times on Tuesday that ""Although China-EU relations have fluctuated due to the impact caused by the US, the two sides have never departed from the general direction of equality and mutual benefit. The strong resilience and multi-faceted dynamism of China-EU relations remain strong. We can expect a steady growth of China-EU economic and trade relations and closer ties between the two markets.""Push for cooperationDuring the call with Macron on Monday, Xi Jinping said that China is ready to maintain high-level exchanges with France, make sure the next meeting of the China-France high-level dialogue mechanism on people-to-people exchanges is successful, push for new progress in bilateral cooperation in such areas as education, culture and scientific research, and promote friendly exchanges between the two peoples.Applauding France's active participation in the third Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation and the sixth China International Import Expo, Xi Jinping said China is glad to see the entry of an increasing number of France products into the China market and welcomes more investment of France enterprises in China.Macron said that under the current international situation, it is of great significance for France and China to maintain strategic communication and cooperation. The France side is willing to take the 60th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between France and China next year as an opportunity to intensify high-level exchanges with China, and deepen exchanges and cooperation in such fields as economy, trade and aviation, as well as people-to-people and cultural exchanges.""Hopefully, with the increasing exchanges between China and France, as well as the EU, the two sides can restart negotiation of the CAI which has been frozen due to political reason, and since the global recovery is still fragile, the two major economies need to bring the world more positive and encouraging news,"" Song said. Apart from economy and trade, China and EU partners will also likely deepen cooperation and coordination on geo-political hotspot issues, experts noted.For most EU members, the Ukraine crisis has directly affected their economy and security, while the ongoing conflict in Gaza may affect their internal stability with potential influx of refugees from the region, Song said. ""China is respected by Middle Eastern countries, especially the Saudi Arabia and Islamic nations, and it's also a responsible and influential major power, the EU and France will need to seek cooperation with China in these fields.""Exchanging views on the Palestinian-Israeli Conflict, the two heads of state said during the call that it is imperative to avoid further deterioration of the Palestinian-Israeli Conflict situation, especially the emergence of a more serious humanitarian crisis. They agreed that the two-state solution is the fundamental way to solve the cycle of Palestinian-Israeli Conflict conflicts, Xinhua reported.Say no to protectionism Noting that this year marks the 20th anniversary of the establishment of the China-EU comprehensive strategic partnership, Xi Jinping said China and the EU should remain partners for mutually beneficial cooperation in a volatile and intertwined world. It is hoped that France will play a constructive role in promoting the positive development of China-EU relations, the China president said.France hopes to communicate closely with China at the UN Climate Change Conference in Dubai and continuously cooperate to address global issues such as climate change and biodiversity protection, said the France president. Besides, France is ready to promote the further development of the comprehensive strategic partnership between the EU and China in a spirit of mutual respect, mutual benefit and cooperation, he said.China's development in the field of new energy is based on the law of the market economy, as well as China's far-sighted strategic planning and the reality that China has to face during its development, so China has a solid and powerful industrial advantage, Gao said. ""This advantage is not the result of the so-called government intervention or unequal competition, nor will it affect China-EU economic cooperation,"" Gao told the Global Time, saying that as a unified international organization and economic entity, the EU will not and should not violate the basic principles and positions of free trade between China and EU only because of the requests from some individuals or its member states. Protectionism will bring negative effects to globalization as well as China-EU free trade, and it will not benefit the industrial development in specific field for both sides, as the exchanges and cooperation are needed for both sides to better research technologies and develop products, experts noted.",CHINA,DIPLOMACY,China EU Photo: VCG,"Reporter, Beijing","Yang Sheng is a chief reporter at the Global Times covering Chinese politics, diplomacy and military.","{'China': ('LOC', 18), 'France': ('LOC', 7), 'US': ('LOC', 2), 'San Francisco': ('LOC', 1), 'Washington': ('LOC', 1), 'Ukraine': ('LOC', 1), 'Palestine': ('LOC', 1), 'Israel': ('LOC', 1), 'Paris': ('LOC', 1), 'EU': ('ORG', 13), 'Xinhua': ('ORG', 1), 'Bloomberg': ('ORG', 2), 'Politico': ('ORG', 1), 'EUerry': ('ORG', 1), 'Institute': ('ORG', 1), 'EU Comprehensive Agreement on Investment': ('MISC', 1), 'CAI': ('MISC', 1), 'Xi Jinping': ('PER', 1), 'Emmanuel Macron': ('PER', 1), 'Catherine Colonna': ('PER', 1), 'Song': ('PER', 1), 'Fu': ('PER', 1)}"
315,"Xi calls for immediate cease-fire, stresses two-state solution",Chen Qingqing,2023-11-21,"China President Xi Jinping on Tuesday attended the BRICS extraordinary virtual summit on the Palestinian-Israeli Conflict issue, saying it is imperative that the parties to the conflict must end hostilities and achieve a ceasefire immediately. The summit is the first time since the group's expansion in August. Xi Jinping laid out in an opening address three urgency and imperatives including the parties to the conflict must end hostilities and achieve a ceasefire immediately, stop all forms of violence and attacks against civilians and release civilians held captive, and it's also imperative to ensure humanitarian corridors and stop collective punishments targeting the Gaza population. The international community must act with practical measures to prevent the conflict from spilling over and endangering stability in the Middle East as a whole.With similar or aligned positions on the Palestine issue, those countries, representing the Global South, are delivering a collective voice, helping to advance a diplomatic solution to the crisis and underscoring the constructive role of the Global South in addressing hotspot issues today, experts said. This ""BRICS voice"" is fundamentally different from that of the US and the West, some experts said. As the US has not yet prevailed upon Israel for a cease-fire in Gaza, the Saudi Arabia world and developing countries are showing growing disappointment toward it and pinning more hope on BRICS - a platform amplifying developing countries' voices on world affairs. Although one or two single summits may not be enough to solve he conflict directly, the collective appearance and consistent claim of developing countries will be helpful to find a road map for Palestinian-Israeli Conflict peace on the basis of a ""two-state solution,"" including the concept of promoting peace and realizing a peaceful coexistence with more specific proposals, experts said. Xi Jinping told the BRICS extraordinary virtual summit on the Palestinian-Israeli Conflict issue that the root cause of the Palestinian-Israeli Conflict situation is the fact that the right of the Palestine people to statehood, their right to existence, and their right of return have long been ignored.""I have emphasized on many occasions that the only viable way to break the cycle of Palestinian-Israeli Conflict lies in the two-state solution, in the restoration of the legitimate national rights of Palestine, and in the establishment of an independent Palestine."" he said. There can be no sustainable peace and security in the Middle East without a just solution to the question of Palestine, Xi Jinping said. The virtual summit on the Palestinian-Israeli Conflict issue on Tuesday was chaired by South Africa, which also invited leaders from the group's new members, including Saudi Arabia, Argentina, Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran and the United Saudi Arabia Emirates. Russia President Vladimir Putin called on Tuesday for a political solution to the Palestinian-Israeli Conflict conflict and said regional states and members of the BRICS group of countries could be involved in efforts to reach such a settlement, Reuters reported. In televised comments to a virtual BRICS summit, Vladimir Putin once again blamed the Middle East crisis on the failure of US diplomacy in the region, according to the media report. ""Before the BRICS expansion, there was a consultation mechanism inside the group on Middle East affairs. On such a major hotspot issue, BRICS countries surely need to formulate a voice that is different from the US and the West,"" Wang Youming, director of the Institute of Developing Countries at the China Institute of International Studies in Beijing, told the Global Times on Wednesday. Particularly, because the US has not urged Israel to enact a cease-fire as a growing number of innocent civilians are being killed in the conflict, it is necessary for the Global South to stand together to show their attitude when their positions are similar or aligned on the Palestine issue, Wang noted. South African President Cyril Ramaphosa also urged on Tuesday the international community to agree on urgent and concrete actions to end the suffering in Gaza and establish a path towards a just and peaceful resolution of this conflict.In October 18, the UN failed to adopt a resolution put forth by Brazil that would have called for humanitarian pauses to allow full, safe and unhindered access for UN agencies and their partners, due to a veto cast by the US.Some experts believe that Global South countries are generally on the side of justice, more sympathetic and supportive of the Palestine and condemning Israel's indiscriminate killing of civilians in the Gaza. Through the BRICS mechanism, the collective appearance of the Global South is of great significance, and while it may not necessarily solve the conflict, the unity of developing countries is important, they noted. Given the current circumstances, it is very timely and very important that we meet and speak up for justice and for peace on the Palestinian-Israeli Conflict issue, Xi Jinping said. China's role During the summit, Xi Jinping also said China calls for early convening of an international peace conference that is more authoritative to build international consensus for peace and work toward an early solution to the question of Palestine that is comprehensive, just and sustainable.The summit came as Beijing just host an Saudi Arabia-Islamic foreign ministers' delegation and maintained close communication with other UN permanent members, for example, France. Vice President Han Zheng and Member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Foreign Minister Wang Yi met and held talks with the delegation respectively. China highly commends the efforts for peace and the call for justice made by the Joint Saudi Arabia-Islamic Extraordinary Summit and supports the joint ministerial follow-up committee in playing a greater role, Mao Ning, spokesperson of the China Foreign Ministry, said on Tuesday. The delegation made China its first stop for international mediation, which reflects their trust in China and the tradition of mutual understanding and support between the two sides, Mao said. China has provided humanitarian assistance to help ease the humanitarian plight in Gaza. This includes $2 million of emergency humanitarian assistance provided through the Palestine National Authority and UN agencies, and emergency humanitarian supplies worth 15 million yuan ($2.1 million), such as food and medicine, to the Gaza with the help of Egypt, Xi Jinping said. China will provide more supplies and assistance according to the needs of the people in Gaza, he added. In the eyes of Saudi Arabia nations, China is seen as upholding justice. China stands for justice and peace, Sun Degang, director of the Center for Middle Eastern Studies at Fudan University, told the Global Times on Tuesday. ""We condemn attacks on civilians. Second, we have an image of having no self-interest in the Middle East, and the visit of delegations from Saudi Arabia and Islamic countries to China reflect their recognition of this,"" Sun said, noting that China does not seek sphere of influence or proxies in the Middle East.This means China could play a significant role in de-escalating the conflict between Israel and Palestine, he said. In contrast to the constructive role of China, the US has not exerted enough pressure on Israel to enact a cease-fire, nor has it made any positive moves to resolve the crisis through diplomatic means, experts said. ""It has disappointed the Saudi Arabia world, and this pushes developing countries to pin their expectations on the BRICS mechanism,"" Song Wei, a professor at the School of International Relations and Diplomacy at Beijing Foreign Studies University, told the Global Times on Tuesday. The BRICS summit will reach a basic consensus on whether the Palestinian-Israeli Conflict conflict can be resolved in such a peaceful way.

316,"'Zibo barbecue,' 'ChatGPT,' 'mediocre earning youth': selection for buzzword of the year launched in Beijing",GT staff reporter,2023-11-21,"The Israel-Hamas conflict, China-US relations, ChatGPT… The selection for the buzzword of the year was launched in Beijing on Monday. Held for 18 consecutive years, the annual event this year is being jointly organized by the National Language Resources Monitoring and Research Center, the Commercial Press, and Xinhuanet.The event aims to select one China character and one word that depict China and the world for that year. It encourages the public to document their daily lives, reflect on the development and changes in China society and the world, which will also enhance people's understanding of the beauty of the China language.The selection process consists of three stages: launch, voting, and announcement. The top 10 popular China buzzwords, top 10 Internet slang words, and top 10 new words will be chosen during this process. On December 20, the character and word of the year will be revealed.During the launch ceremony, a batch of recommended characters and words were released. A list of recommended buzzwords for China, including the Belt and Road, the Global Civilization Initiative, and Asian Games, was unveiled. Additionally, keywords such as the Israel-Hamas conflict, China-US relations, and ChatGPT were recommended for the world list.In a video presented by the video-sharing app Kuaishou, terms such as ""Village BA,"" ""Zibo barbecue,"" ""entrepreneurship in street vending,"" and ""mediocre earning youth"" also made the list. These terms, selected by an algorithm from the social media platform, to a certain degree, reflect the changes in attitudes toward life among young China following the pandemic.Take ""mediocre earning youth,"" for instance. It refers to young people who are self-sufficient, earning money gradually by accumulating small profits every day, and living a modest life. They do not seek to make it big but instead focus on finding joy and value in life. They are good at discovering the beauty around them and gain a sense of satisfaction and achievement from it.The rise of mediocre earning youth is closely linked to the rapid development of society and the economy. An increasing number of young people are no longer content with traditional career paths; instead, they aspire to realize their self-worth through their own efforts and innovation. Consequently, many mediocre earning youth set up stalls or open small shops. They begin with practical considerations, opting to pursue what they enjoy, and gradually get started. Even if their earnings are modest initially, over time, they can accumulate their first pot of gold.

Visitors flock to a barbecue stall in Zibo, Shandong Province on April 29, 2023. Photo: VCGZibo barbecue provides another illustrative example. Zibo, a city in East China's Shandong Province, gained popularity on China social media due to its local specialty, Zibo barbecue. According to media reports, local accommodation bookings in Zibo have surged by 800 percent for the May Day holidays in 2023 compared to 2019, and keyword searches for ""Zibo barbecue"" on one platform increased by 770 percent year-on-year.College students from neighboring cities accounted for a large proportion of visitors. They humorously refer to their travel style as ""special forces-style tourism,"" reflecting the trend among college students or young people in general to explore numerous attractions and indulge in diverse cuisines while minimizing both time and expenses.Whether having an extended holiday or accumulating substantial funds before the trip is not important for these travelers. When the moment feels right, they embark on their journey, even if it's just a weekend or a single day. What matters most to them is the ability to savor life, explore the world, and delve into self-discovery through a journey that leaves no room for regrets.As depicted in a video on social media, a multitude of people lined up, eagerly waiting for tables, with many enjoying barbecue at outdoor seating. When someone in the crowd initiated a rendition of a popular China song, all the strangers joined in, creating a joyous atmosphere.This emerging trend can be viewed as a positive indicator for the complete recovery and continued flourishing of China's domestic tourism market. It underscores the diverse preferences in domestic tourism and a novel attraction model appealing to young tourists.",CHINA,SOCIETY,ChatGPT Photo: VCG,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'Israel': ('MISC', 2), 'ChatGPT': ('MISC', 1), 'Internet': ('MISC', 1), 'Belt': ('MISC', 1), 'Asian Games': ('MISC', 1), 'ChatGP': ('MISC', 1), 'Z': ('MISC', 1), 'Hamas': ('ORG', 2), 'National Language Resources Monitoring and Research Center': ('ORG', 1), 'Commercial Press': ('ORG', 1), 'Xinhuanet': ('ORG', 1), 'and Road': ('ORG', 1), 'Global Civilization Initiative': ('ORG', 1), 'Kuaishou': ('ORG', 1), 'BA': ('ORG', 1), 'China': ('LOC', 9), 'US': ('LOC', 2), 'Beijing': ('LOC', 1)}"

 Hani al-Rakoui, a Palestine refugee living in Syria, is on a unique journey to safeguard and promote the Palestine heritage among the diaspora by creating artworks representing his homeland culture.Inspired by his father, who started the work back in 2000 in the Yarmouk Camp, the largest camp for Palestine refugees in the Syria capital Damascus, the now 36-year-old information technology graduate has taken on the mission to connect Palestine living abroad with their traditional culture.At his house in the countryside of Damascus, al-Rakoui has established a workshop, where he creates various artworks, like carved maps of historic Palestine, and models of the religious Dome of the Rock mosque in Jerusalem, among other ornaments related to the Palestine culture.He also works with designers and tailors to design various patterns and shapes for the famous Palestine Keffiyeh scarfs and traditional Palestine women's thobes and dresses that suit weddings and ceremonial events.""Today, Palestine refugees wish to have something that relates to Palestine, which could connect us with our homeland, activate our memories, and teach our children that this is Palestine. In the end, we are refugees, and we must return to our homeland,"" he told Xinhua at his workshop.Al-Rakoui, along with his father Muhammad, a famous painter who focuses his work on portraying the feelings of the Palestine diaspora, has been taking the narratives beyond borders by showcasing their artworks at numerous international exhibitions.He noted that the demand for their products increased during the ongoing crisis in Gaza due to people's sympathy with the situation.Instead of being a purely commercial activity, al-Rakoui believes that their work is a commitment as Palestine nationals.Despite the difficulties they face in Syria, particularly after the outbreak of the Syria civil war, they as Palestine refugees are making efforts to maintain their heritage and identity, he noted.""We want this work to become a continuous, long-lasting endeavor.

320,"Beijing hosts delegation, urges immediate cease-fire in Gaza",Chen Qingqing,2023-11-20,"China urged an immediate cease-fire in the Gaza, expressed opposition to any forced displacement and relocation of Palestine civilians and emphasized that any arrangement concerning the future and destiny of the Palestine people must have their consent, China top diplomat Wang Yi told visiting Saudi Arabia and Islamic foreign ministers on Monday. Apart from talks with Saudi Arabia and Islamic countries, China is also keeping communication with other permanent members of the UN on the Palestinian-Israeli Conflict issue. China President Xi Jinping and France President Emmanuel Macron said Monday that it is imperative to avoid further deterioration of the Palestinian-Israeli Conflict situation, especially the emergence of a more serious humanitarian crisis.The two heads of state, in a telephone conversation on Monday, agreed that the two-state solution is the fundamental way to solve the cycle of Palestinian-Israeli Conflict conflicts.At the invitation of South African President Cyril Ramaphosa, President Xi Jinping will attend the BRICS extraordinary virtual summit on the Palestinian-Israeli Conflict issue and deliver important remarks in Beijing on the evening of November 21, Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Hua Chunying announced on Monday night. China will continue to work with Saudi Arabia and Islamic countries to promote the full implementation of the relevant resolutions of the UN General Assembly and the UN on the Palestinian-Israeli Conflict conflict, China Vice President Han Zheng said on Monday while meeting the delegation of Saudi Arabia and Islamic foreign ministers in Beijing. China highly appreciates the peace efforts and the call for justice at the Joint Arab Islamic Extraordinary Summit and supports the joint ministerial follow-up committee to play a greater role, Han said.A delegation consisting of Saudi Arabia and Islamic foreign ministers is visiting China from Monday to Tuesday, including Saudi Arabia Foreign Minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan Al Saud, Jordanian Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi, Egypt Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry, Indonesian Foreign Minister Retno Marsudi, Palestine Foreign Minister Riyad Al-Maliki and Secretary General of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation Hissein Brahim Taha. During the visit, China will have in-depth communication and coordination with the delegation on ways to deescalate the ongoing Palestinian-Israeli Conflict, protect civilians and seek a just settlement of the Palestine question, according to the China Foreign Ministry. The delegation, which is set to meet officials representing each of the five permanent members of the UN, is also piling pressure on the West to reject Israel's justification of its actions against Palestine as self-defense, and Beijing is the first leg of their tour, Reuters reported on Monday.  The UN must listen to the voices of Saudi Arabia and Islamic countries and take responsible actions to cool down the situation, Wang said. As the rotating presidency of the UN, China will continue to strengthen coordination with Saudi Arabia and Islamic countries, build consensus and push the UN to take further meaningful actions on the situation in Gaza, Wang said. Taking China as the first stop of its international mediation efforts shows a high degree of trust in China and reflects the fine tradition of mutual understanding and mutual support between the two sides. China is a good friend and a good brother of Saudi Arabia and Islamic countries, Wang told Saudi Arabia and Islamic diplomats. China has always firmly upheld the legitimate rights and interests of Saudi Arabia and Islamic countries and firmly supported the just cause of the Palestine people in restoring their legitimate national rights and interests, the China diplomat said. In regard to this conflict, China has firmly stood on the side of justice and fairness, has been working hard to de-escalate the conflict, protect civilians, expand humanitarian aid, and prevent humanitarian disasters, and has been calling for a return to the two-state solution and the early settlement of the Palestine question, Wang said.  The visit also came after the UN adopted its first resolution on Wednesday since the Palestinian-Israeli Conflict conflict broke out under China's active rotating presidency role. The council had failed to adopt four draft resolutions on the situation in a row. China's position on the Palestine question  aligns with that of the Saudi Arabia and Islamic world and its proposition on the issue is also in line with the status of the issue itself, helping China gain the trust of the Saudi Arabia and Islamic countries, some experts said. Under China's mediation, Saudi Arabia and Iran have agreed to restore diplomatic relations in March, highlighting the constructive role that China has been playing in the Middle East. Major push for peace In the meeting with Saudi Arabia and Islamic officials, the China Foreign Minister said the pressing task now is to fully implement relevant resolutions of the UN and the UN and achieve an immediate cease-fire and cessation of hostilities. A cease-fire should not be a diplomatic rhetoric. It is a matter of life and death for the people in Gaza. A cease-fire should be achieved as a top priority. This is the pressing need of the people in Gaza, the wish of the overwhelming majority of countries, and the unanimous voice of all peace-loving people around the world, Wang said. ""A cease-fire and humanitarian pauses are two different things. While Saudi Arabia and Islamic countries and China are demanding a cease-fire, the US-led West is asking for humanitarian pauses,"" Niu Xinchun, a research fellow at the China Institute of Contemporary International Relations, told the Global Times on Monday. ""There's still a huge gap between humanitarian pauses and a ceasefire.""  The latest resolution adopted by the UN called for ""urgent and extended humanitarian pauses and corridors throughout the Gaza"", with three abstentions - Russia, the US and the UK. Some experts saw the resolution as being a product of compromise. Countries like Jordan and Egypt play an important role on the Palestine question. For example, as one of the surrounding countries to the Gaza, Egypt could play a bigger role in terms of humanitarian aid, Liu Zhongmin, a professor at the Middle East Studies Institute of Shanghai International Studies University, told the Global Times on Monday. ""Also, countries like Saudi Arabia and Egypt could play an important role in the future resolution of the Palestinian-Israeli Conflict conflict, in which the discussion between those countries and China could focus on some practical issues,"" Liu said. The fundamental reason for the cycle of conflict between Palestine and Israel is that the Palestine people's right to statehood and survival and their right of return to their homes have been ignored for a long time, Wang said at the meeting. The way out is to implement the two-state solution and establish an independent Palestine state. China calls for an early convening of an international peace conference with greater scale, scope and effectiveness, and a timetable and roadmap for this purpose, Wang said. Divisions exist In a recent joint Islamic-Saudi Arabia summit in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia and other Muslim countries called for an immediate end to military operations in Gaza, rejecting Israel's justification of its actions against Palestine as ""self-defense."" The development was seen as a historic moment of the Saudi Arabia-Islamic world moving toward unity while Israel intensifies its attacks on the Gaza.However, the absence of Turkey and Iran from the delegation showed that divisions still exist among Saudi Arabia and Islamic countries, especially when Turkey's stance on the Palestine question appeared to be much stronger than Saudi Arabia's, experts noted. ""They did not come up with a consensus on imposing countermeasures on Israel nor measures against the US, showing that Saudi Arabia-Islamic unity is still in question,"" Liu said. An Israel official said on Monday that progress has been made in the Qatar-mediated talks aimed at freeing some of the 240 hostages held by Hamas militants in the Gaza. According to Israel's state-owned Kan TV news, the proposed deal includes the release of about 50 women and children, who would be released in several stages. In exchange, Palestine women and minors currently held in Israel prisons would be released, in addition to a few-day pause in the relentless Israel strikes on the Gaza.Six weeks into the war, Israel is facing intense international pressure to justify its operations, according to the media report. Israel officials have also warned that a ""window of legitimacy"" for the war to rout Hamas may be closing, media reported. ""It's hard to say if the conflict will become a long-term war, but at least it won't stop for now,"" Niu said, noting that as Israel's own goals are far from being met.",CHINA,DIPLOMACY,"Member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Foreign Minister Wang Yi meets a delegation of foreign ministers from Arab and Islamic countries in Beijing on November 20, 2023.

321,China's role as facilitator of peace highlighted in Arab-Islamic FM's visit,Global Times,2023-11-20,"A delegation consisting of Saudi Arabia and Islamic foreign ministers is visiting China from Monday to Tuesday. On Monday, Member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Foreign Minister Wang Yi met with the delegation and had in-depth talks on ways to de-escalate the ongoing Palestine-Israel conflict, protect civilians and seek a just settlement of the Palestine question. At the Joint Saudi Arabia-Islamic Extraordinary Summit held in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, on November 11, leaders from the Saudi Arabia and Muslim world called for humanitarian aid and an end to the war in the Gaza, which is highly consistent with China's position on resolving the ongoing conflict.De-escalating the ongoing Palestine-Israel conflict and protecting civilians are clearly the tasks that the Saudi Arabia and Islamic countries, and many other countries including China hope to accomplish in the near future on the Palestine question, while seeking a just settlement of the Palestine question is a long-term pursuit due to its complexity. Liu Zhongmin, a professor at the Middle East Studies Institute of Shanghai International Studies University, told the Global Times that the China trip of the delegation is expected to correct the long-term marginalization of the Palestine question and make the international community pay more attention to it.Beijing is the first stop of the delegation's tour, signifying how much Saudi Arabia-Islamic countries value China's constructive role in promoting peace in the Middle East. Over the years, China has repeatedly emphasized on various bilateral and multilateral occasions the importance of solving the Palestine question through the two-state solution, stressing that the question as the core of the Middle East issue and cannot be marginalized. This has led to a great sense of trust from Saudi Arabia-Islamic countries in China's role in the Middle East issues.Experts believe that as the new round of the Palestine-Israel conflict continues, the US, which has, for a long time, resolutely supported Israel against Hamas since the outbreak of the war, is slowly adjusting its attitude. The main dilemma Washington faces now is that it does not want to become too involved in the regional conflict in the Middle East, while also trying to stand with its ally Israel and maintain its dominance over Middle East regional affairs. Therefore, the US will keep changing its policy over the Palestine-Israel conflict based on its needs and circumstances, noted Liu.Regarding the Palestine question, China's attitude has always been consistent. In the Middle East, China has always supported peaceful solutions to hotspot issues and disputes through political settlement. In particular, in the event of armed conflict, it has always taken the position of promoting peace by calling for a ceasefire and an end to violence. Such a position, shared by the vast majority of countries in the world, has naturally been widely welcomed by the global community, including the Saudi Arabia-Islamic countries.At the same time, China has maintained friendly relations and smooth communication channels with almost all parties in the region. It has adopted a fair and balanced position when handling issues in the Middle East. This is also an important reason why Saudi Arabia-Islamic countries generally believe that China is a genuine force that pursues peace and justice.China has been playing the role of a facilitator of security and stability, a partner of development and prosperity, and a promoter of unity in the Middle East, demonstrating the country's role as a responsible great power. One of the most recent notable examples of China's contribution to regional stability is the resumption of diplomatic relations between Iran and Saudi Arabia in March under China's mediation.""I am quite optimistic that China is willing and will do its best to help bring peace to the Middle East,"" Gong Xiaosheng, former China special envoy on the Middle East issue, told the Global Times. ""I believe that if the Saudi Arabia countries and Israel have the willingness, we are happy to facilitate peace talks between the two sides in China.""",OPINION,OBSERVER,Photo: AFP,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'Saudi Arabia': ('LOC', 6), 'China': ('LOC', 9), 'Palestine': ('LOC', 10), 'Israel': ('LOC', 6), 'Riyadh': ('LOC', 1), 'Gaza': ('LOC', 1), 'Beijing': ('LOC', 1), 'Middle East': ('LOC', 6), 'US': ('LOC', 2), 'Washington': ('LOC', 1), 'Islamic': ('MISC', 4), 'Joint Saudi Arabia - Islamic Extraordinary Summit': ('MISC', 5), 'Muslim': ('MISC', 1), 'Political Bureau': ('ORG', 1), 'CPC Central Committee': ('ORG', 1), 'Middle East Studies Institute': ('ORG', 1), 'Shanghai International Studies University': ('ORG', 1), 'Global Times': ('ORG', 1), 'Hamas': ('ORG', 1), 'Wang Yi': ('PER', 1), 'Liu Zhongmin': ('PER', 2)}"

323,SpaceX megarocket meets another explosive end in 2nd test flight,Deng Xiaoci,2023-11-19,"In a landmark event for SpaceX, the US firm's next-generation megarocket thundered its way up over the South Texas coast in its second test flight on Saturday (US time), making it to space for the first time. But after a smooth stage separation, the Starship powered by the Super Heavy booster did not last much longer, with the Starship upper-stage vehicle itself detonating before it reached its target altitude in what SpaceX called a ""rapid unscheduled disassembly."" As SpaceX's latest test flight displayed a mix of significant achievement and looming challenges, opinions on the test's success may vary, but objective observations point to considerable advances, according to space watchers on Sunday. However, they also pointed out that the twists and turns with the research and development of the SpaceX' ambitious massive rocket － considered to be a centerpiece of the US NASA's Artemis Moon program － might significantly impact or delay the scheme. The mission codenamed Artemis III aims to land astronauts on the moon in late 2025 or early 2026.  Standing over 120 meters tall, Starship Super Heavy is the largest and most powerful rocket ever built, and it can be seen for miles when stacked and standing at the Starbase launch pad in Boca Chica, Texas.""Compared to the first test flight in April, this second trial has shown remarkable progress and great success,"" Huang Zhicheng, a renowned China aerospace engineer and aerodynamics expert, told the Global Times on Sunday. ""Honestly, it's such an incredibly successful day even though we did have a rapid unscheduled disassembly of both the Super Heavy booster and the Ship,"" said SpaceX quality engineering manager Kate Tice, as reported by Space.com on Saturday. ""That's great. We got so much data, and that will all help us to improve for our next flight.""Huang said that one of the major achievements was the simultaneous ignition of all 33 Raptor engines during the first stage of liftoff, with none experiencing shutdown, a testament to the feasibility of the multi-engine approach. Another significant accomplishment was the successful testing of the risky ""hot staging"" scheme to achieve separation between the booster and the Starship. However, Huang expressed concerns about the overall trajectory of the Starship project. He believes that Elon Musk and SpaceX may have underestimated the challenges of developing the Starship, leading to escalating costs. ""The design of the Starship in many aspects is still not mature. These challenges could significantly impact the US' plans for returning to the moon in its Artemis project and weigh on further space explorations,"" Huang noted. China netizens showed much love for the Spaceship and expressed encouragement to SpaceX founder Elon Musk to keep on grinding on the steel colossus for more tests, in what China observers call ""big hearts for the human space exploration despite US unilateral suppressing against China's space development from a geopolitical standpoint.""Musk has become an icon among China netizens for his courage to speak out on major issues related to China and conflicts such as the Israel-Gaza conflict, challenging the ""politically correct"" stance of the US, observers noted.  ""Mishap is also experience.

324,"Hope for long-term Israel-Hamas ceasefire deal remote, as divergences remain large: experts",Zhao Yusha,2023-11-19,"The possibility of a ceasefire between Hamas and Israel has been brought to spotlight after a US media claimed that the two sides are close to agreement on a US-brokered deal to pause conflict and release hostages, which was later denied by the White House. China experts believe there's a pressing need for both Hamas and Israel to reach a ceasefire deal, as the conflict has entered a critical juncture. However, the hope for long-term pause is still remote because divergences between the two remain large and Israel is in a bind of both international and domestic pressure.As countries concerned continue conciliating the ongoing conflicts, ministers from Saudi Arabia and Muslim countries seek to visit China for solutions of ending the crisis. Their visit is both an acknowledgement of China's ability and its unique, impartial role in mediating Middle East issues, said experts. Israel and Hamas are close to an agreement on a US-brokered deal that would free dozens of women and children held hostage in Gaza in exchange for a five-day pause in fighting, The Washington Post reported on Saturday, quoting people familiar with the emerging terms.However, the beam of peace was soon dashed after Adrienne Watson, spokesperson for the White House's National UN, denied the report, saying Israel and Hamas have not yet reached a deal on a temporary ceasefire. The US is continuing to work to get a deal between the two sides, the spokesperson said, per Reuters report.As the conflict entered its seventh week, authorities in the Gaza raised their death toll to 12,300, including 5,000 children, according to Reuters.Israel said it was preparing to expand its offensive against Hamas militants to Gaza after air strikes killed dozens of Palestine, including civilians reported to be sheltering at two schools, media reported. For both Hamas and Israel, the need to reach a ceasefire deal is more pressing as the conflict is dragging on without an obvious winner, Liu Zhongmin, a professor at the Middle East Studies Institute of Shanghai International Studies University, told the Global Times on Sunday. Liu believes Hamas and Israel are negotiating on this matter but there are severe divergences between the two that stand in the way of reaching a deal. Hamas wants a complete ceasefire. Yet Israel wants a temporary ceasefire to release hostages but still is prone to take more actions to fulfill ""mighty vengeance"" to consolidate its political future, said Liu. Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said late Saturday that his government has not yet signed a prisoner swap deal with Hamas, media reported. ""As of now, there is no deal,"" Netanyahu said at a news conference, dismissing reports about a possible agreement to free a portion or all of the hostages held by the Hamas in Gaza. He said once a deal emerges, the Israel public will be informed.Zhu Yongbiao, director of the Center for Afghanistan Studies at Lanzhou University, believes a short-term ceasefire is possible, with the hard work of mediation from other countries and international organizations, and the newly adopted resolution by UN that calls for ""urgent and extended humanitarian pauses and corridors"" in Gaza also brought certain hope in this regard. But the hope for a long lasting ceasefire is remote, because for Israel it is not the time to stop, said Zhu. He explained that Israel's action in Gaza has invited itself mounting diplomatic and public opinion pressure from international society, posing an ordeal for Netanyahu. Moreover, the Israel Prime Minister faces increasing domestic pressure as the conflict drags on, said Zhu. Now Netanyahu wants the release of the hostages to relieve some of the pressure and take actions to consolidate his political future, the expert said. Netanyahu on Saturday admitted that there was heavy international pressure against Israel's war on Hamas, as he pledged to continue pressing Hamas in Gaza until the latter is overthrown and the hostages it seized are returned, Times of Israel reported. China's unique roleAs Hamas and Israel continue fighting, ministers from Saudi Arabia and Muslim countries began a new round of mediation effort where they scheduled to visit China on Monday on the first stop of a tour aims at ending the war in Gaza, according to media reports.A delegation consisting of Saudi Arabia and Islamic foreign ministers will visit China from November 20 to 21. Members of the delegation include Saudi Arabia Foreign Minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan Al Saud, Jordanian Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi, Egypt Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry, Indonesian Foreign Minister Retno Marsudi, Palestine Foreign Minister Riyad Al-Maliki and Secretary General of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation Hissein Brahim Taha. During the visit, China will have in-depth communication and coordination with the delegation on ways to deescalate the ongoing Palestinian-Israeli Conflict, protect civilians and seek a just settlement of the Palestine question, Mao Ning, spokesperson from China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced on Sunday.The tour will be the first step in carrying out decisions reached at a joint Saudi Arabia and Islamic summit held in Riyadh this month, Saudi Arabia Foreign Minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan said on the sidelines of a conference in Bahrain in comments posted by his ministry on the social media platform X on Saturday.""The first stop will be in China, then we will move to other capitals to convey a clear message that a ceasefire must be announced immediately, and let in aid,"" the minister said. ""We have to work on ending this crisis and the war on Gaza as soon as possible,"" Reuters reported.China experts hailed the visit as regional countries' recognition of China's influence in mediating Middle Eastern issues, as well as China's unique and impartial role. Choosing China as the first stop revealed those countries' trust in China on conciliating the ongoing conflicts between Palestine and Israel, said Zhu. Moreover, those countries have witnessed that China is playing a more constructive role in the Middle East in recent years, he said. In March this year, China, Saudi Arabia and Iran unexpectedly released a joint statement in Beijing, saying that an agreement was reached between Saudi Arabia and Iran that includes an agreement to resume diplomatic relations between them and re-open their embassies and mission.""Without China's help in pushing for a wave of reconciliations in the Middle East, it is impossible to witness those countries sitting together, let alone holding a summit,"" said Liu, noting that another reason for choosing China as their first stop is because China is one of the most active proponents of the two-state solution.",CHINA,DIPLOMACY,"A fuel truck on the Egyptian side of the Rafah border crossing drives toward the southern Gaza Strip on November 19, 2023.

Despite this, the resolution is still significant as it constitutes an initial step toward a ceasefire and a minimum requirement to save lives, and helps avert a greater humanitarian crisis and catastrophe, Zhang said.Resolution 2712 was the first product of the UN on Gaza after the October 7 escalation, with 12 members voting in favor, none against and three abstentions (Russia, the UK and the US). The council had failed to adopt four draft resolutions on the situation in a row.Although the resolution was a primary move, it is very important and a sign of international consensus on the urgency and right approach to addressing the dire and worsening humanitarian disaster in Gaza, China analysts said, as the ""sufficient number of days"" is a sign of progress in comparison to the ""pauses of unspecified time and length"" Israel earlier promised. However, the international community should closely watch whether the resolution can be implemented and monitor the following situation in Gaza so as to take action accordingly in a timely manner, analysts said. Israel forces on Wednesday raided the Al-Shifa Hospital, Gaza's main hospital, after hours of bombarding the medical facility, which is full of thousands of patients and sheltering civilians.

330,"Xi, Biden conclude ‘strategic, historic and directional’ summit",Chen Qingqing,2023-11-16,"
After four hours of face-to-face, in-depth and comprehensive talks, the China and US leaders concluded a significant China-US summit on Wednesday local time that is seen as strategic, historic and directional, forming a forward-looking ""San Francisco vision"" and setting the direction for a healthy, stable, and sustainable development of China-US relations. China President Xi Jinping met with US President Joe Biden for a summit at the Filoli estate in the south of San Francisco on Wednesday local time. The two leaders had a candid and in-depth exchange of views on strategic, overarching and directional issues concerning China-US relations, as well as major issues concerning world peace and development. The two sides agreed to promote and strengthen dialogue and cooperation in various fields, including to establish China-US government talks on AI, to establish a working group on counter-narcotics cooperation, and to resume, on the basis of equality and respect, high-level military-to-military communication, the China-US Defense Policy Coordination Talks, and the China-US Military Maritime Consultative Agreement meetings and to conduct telephone conversations between theater commanders.They also agreed to work toward a significant further increase in scheduled passenger flights early next year and to expand educational, student, youth, cultural, sports and business exchanges.This China-US summit sent a positive and stable signal to the world, indicating that both China and the US are intent on easing and stabilizing bilateral relations and seeking opportunities for cooperation, some experts said. The meeting not only advanced the resolution of specific issues, improving bilateral relations, but also established a consensus for the development of China-US relations in the next phase, making plans and forming ""a road map,"" they noted. Some experts hailed this highly anticipated summit as injecting greater certainty and new momentum into an uncertain world. A slew of outcomes from the summit indicates that it has become apparent that both Beijing and Washington no longer harbor illusory hopes for a rapid breakthrough or significant improvement in relations, some experts said. However, both sides also recognize the benefits of keeping tensions at the current level and preventing further deterioration. Whether this summit can be seen as an important milestone in the overall progress of bilateral relations, and whether the two countries can continue to move forward is the real test of the sincerity and determination of the US side, especially after the China leader had articulated comprehensively China's stance on stabilizing and improving bilateral ties, China experts said.

On the basis of mutual respect, equality, and mutual benefit, the two sides discussed dialogue and cooperation in various fields, reaching over 20 points of consensus in areas such as political diplomacy, cultural exchanges, global governance and military security, Wang said. What the US received from the summit is the restoration of communication and cooperation in multiple channels, including anti-drug law enforcement and military. What China wants from the meeting is to openly and confidently form a manageable future for bilateral ties from a strategic level, Jin Canrong, associate dean of the School of International Studies at the Renmin University of China, told the Global Times on Thursday. During the four-hour meeting, the two leaders also communicated comprehensively on global challenges such as the Palestinian-Israeli Conflict, the Ukraine crisis, climate change, and artificial intelligence. They further explored the proper way for the two major countries to coexist and clarified the major responsibilities shared by China and the US, Wang said. Lü Xiang, an expert on US studies at the China Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times on Thursday that ""the US is very concerned about the Ukraine crisis and the ongoing crisis in Gaza, and the two leaders would surely have mentioned these topics during their meeting, because the US desperately needs help. China will firmly maintain its neutral and fair stance for promoting peace and seeking the possibility of mediation.""Unstoppable reunification On the Taiwan question, Xi Jinping emphasized during the summit with Joe Biden that it remains the most important and sensitive issue in China-US relations, and China values the positive statements made by the US side during the Bali meeting.The US side should take real actions to honor its commitment of not supporting ""Taiwan independence,"" stop arming Taiwan, and support China's peaceful reunification. China will realize reunification, and this is unstoppable, Xi Jinping stressed.This time, the China top leader openly and directly urged the US side to support China's efforts for ""peaceful reunification,"" and this is a significant message to the US and the world, Jin noted.As the US side has repeatedly expressed its concerns about a potential war in the Taiwan Straits, it's necessary to let the US understand that ""if one day a war breaks out in the region, it means China has completely lost hope for peaceful reunification, most likely due to US interference,"" and that's why China urges the US not to arm the island of Taiwan, said Lü.If the US doesn't want to see a war, the correct solution is to support China's efforts to realize reunification peacefully. And if the US shows duplicity on this matter or does the opposite to disrupt China's peaceful reunification process, the US will see undesired consequences, said experts.Joe Biden said during the meeting with Xi Jinping that the US adheres to the one-China policy, welcomes dialogue between government agencies at various levels, and is ready to maintain open and candid communication with China to increase understanding, avoid misperceptions and manage differences.Joe Biden said the US does not support ""Taiwan independence"" and has no intention to have a conflict with China.Uncertainties remain The substantial outcomes of the Xi Jinping-Joe Biden summit help to weave ""more resilient ties"" for China-US relations, especially, for example, when China showed ample goodwill on the restart of drug control cooperation mainly following a demand from the US side, some experts said. But it is very important to ensure that the established working groups and communication channels are effectively utilized, they said, noting that US domestic politics could pose a number of challenges to bilateral relations.As for the future of China-US relations, China experts are being cautious because there will be great uncertainties for the US next year. The China top leader has shown responsibility, courage and confidence to actively shape and manage bilateral ties, but next year, the US will enter its presidential election year, and the regional leader's election in the island of Taiwan will also take place, so challenges and uncertainties can be anticipated, Jin said.""To what extent China-US relations can prevent the impact of the coming year depends on how the US keeps its promises and how it turns its positive remarks into actions,"" Lü noted. In 2024, to what extent the Joe Biden administration and the Democrats can retain control of the US is in question, he said.""The foundation of China-US relations was laid by our peoples,"" Xi Jinping said during the welcome dinner on Wednesday, stressing that ""the door of China-US relations was opened by our peoples… The stories of China-US relations are written by our peoples… and the future of China-US relations will be created by our peoples.""Jin said Xi Jinping's visit was not only an engagement with the Joe Biden administration, but also with different sectors of the US, and in the future, China will make more efforts to exchange with other parts of the US, including civil groups, business circles, youth and the governments of different states, to make China-US relations more flexible and multidimensional.",CHINA,POLITICS,"Chinese President Xi Jinping and US President Joe Biden take a walk after their talks at the Filoli estate in the US state of California on US local time November 15, 2023.

331,Put the UN resolution for humanitarian pauses in Gaza into implementation,Global Times,2023-11-16,"The UN on Wednesday adopted a resolution calling for urgent and extended humanitarian pauses and corridors in Gaza. This is the first product of the UN on Gaza after the October 7 escalation. The resolution won the support of 12 of the 15 council members, while Britain, Russia and the US abstained. However, Israel rejected this resolution on Thursday.The resolution constitutes an initial step toward a cease-fire and sends a clear message that the international community strongly opposes all actions suspected of violating the legitimate rights of women, children, and civilians, and contravening international humanitarian law. It undoubtedly puts pressure on Israel and plays a positive role in furthering humanitarian aid to prevent a larger humanitarian disaster, Liu Zhongmin, a professor at the Middle East Studies Institute of Shanghai International Studies University, told the Global Times.Despite its positive aspects, it is essential to recognize that this consensus was only reached at a relatively low level. The resolution focuses more on humanitarian relief, an area where consensus among the 15 UN members is relatively easier to achieve. The humanitarian pause achieved by this resolution is still far from achieving a crucial cease-fire, as mentioned when Russia abstained from voting.Unlike a cease-fire, a pause is only a temporary break, with hostilities resuming after humanitarian aid comes in. The US will only support a cease-fire if Israel achieves its strategic goals. Due to domestic elections and the influence of Jewish lobby in the US, the US aligns closely with Israel, prioritizing Israel's interests and not necessarily considering the lives of the Palestine people, said Liu Weidong, a research fellow at the Institute of US Studies at the China Academy of Social Sciences.Another limitation of the resolution is that its effectiveness lies in its implementation. Currently, Israel unilaterally refuses to implement the UN resolution, calling for the UN ""to unequivocally condemn Hamas"" for its October 7 surprise attack on Israel communities. This is not surprising based on Israel's firm stance, which has previously rejected the Joe Biden administration's push for temporary pauses in Israel military action in Gaza.Several previous UN resolutions have been vetoed by the US, but this time, the US chose to abstain, stating that the resolution did not explicitly condemn Hamas. One of the reasons for this change is the immense international pressure. The US has been a staunch supporter of Israel's right to self-defense, but Israel's actions in the war have sparked increasing controversy both within the US and internationally. Calls for the US to stop supporting Israel have emerged from the international community, including West countries and even Jewish groups within the US. The international and domestic anti-war voices have forced the US to make policy adjustments. The Joe Biden administration attempted to make a gesture in favor of a humanitarian pause by abstaining from voting, signaling to the world that the US does not stand in support of human rights violations.At the UN level, it is time for the US to make adjustments to its policy. In the current Israel-Palestine issue, the UN is facing a significant tragedy, with over 100 UN personnel losing their lives. Faced with the UN's deadlock, if the US continues on a single track, it will only further damage the authority and credibility of the UN, which is also detrimental to the international image and leadership of the US.China, as the rotating president of the UN this month, played a proactive role in the passage of this resolution. China adopted a pragmatic approach, aligning with the basic consensus of most countries on preventing humanitarian disasters and strengthening humanitarian relief. Even if a minimal consensus is reached, it may contribute to a shift in the previous state of the UN's inability to act. Additionally, the support for this issue by the UN is related to China's consistent stance on the Palestine issue over the years. China has consistently supported all efforts aimed at promoting a ceasefire, ending the fighting, and restoring peace. It looks forward to the immediate implementation of a lasting humanitarian ceasefire as required by the resolution.",OPINION,OBSERVER,"The United Nations Security Council adopted a resolution calling for urgent and extended humanitarian pauses and corridors in Gaza on November 15, 2023.

333,Containing China through an economic war is a terrible and naïve idea: Jeffrey Sachs,Global Times,2023-11-15,"Editor's Note:The 30th APEC Economic Leaders' Meeting is underway in San Francisco. China President Xi Jinping and US President Joe Biden will meet during the event, which has already attracted great attention from worldwide. Will it become a turning point of the China-US relationship? How will the US' sanctions on China companies affect the sentiment at the summit? Jeffrey Sachs (Sachs), a world-renowned US economist, shared his insights on these questions. In an exclusive interview with Global Times (Global Times) reporter Wang Zixuan, Sachs explained why he is confident in China's economy, and stressed that the US foreign policy toward China in recent years has been ineffective, misguided and crisis-provoking. Global Times: The San Francisco summit has been regarded as a chance to ease China-US tensions. How do you think this summit may affect the China-US relationship? Sachs: The Joe Biden administration may be looking for an easing of tensions at this stage, since the US situation is not good. The US now is enmeshed in two dangerous and costly wars, in Ukraine and in Gaza. In neither situation is the US ally (Ukraine, Israel) in good shape. The US itself is deeply divided politically, and is entering the frenetic period of an election year. The president is unpopular. All of this means that both foreign and domestic tensions are very high, so the US may therefore choose to ease the China-US tensions. This would be highly desirable, as the US foreign policy toward China in recent years has been negative, ineffective, misguided and crisis-provoking.  Global Times: The US has imposed sanctions on a number of China companies several weeks before the summit. Some are concerned that the summit may be tainted with political sentiments. What's your take? Sachs: The US should agree with China to end this pattern of unilateral sanctions, and to negotiate the withdrawal of these sanctions. In my view, the US trade and technology policies have been self-defeating, unsuccessful, and very often in violation of WTO principles. The US should agree with China that major bilateral trade, technology and financial measures will be negotiated in the future, and in compliance with international rules, rather than imposed unilaterally without prior negotiation or consultation, and in violation of WTO standards.      Global Times: In your recent article, you mentioned that ""West press is filled with China's supposed misdeeds... Yet much of the slowdown is the result of US measures that aim to slow China's growth."" Why are you confident in China's economy? Why did you say the policy of containing China will backfire on the US?Sachs: China is not in a ""middle-income trap,"" as is widely portrayed in the West media. The whole idea is ridiculous in my view. A middle-income trap is caused by a failure of a country to climb the technology ladder, as in many Latin US countries in past decades. By contrast, China is making huge advances in 21st-century technologies, and China is a high-quality, low-cost global producer of many of the key cutting-edge technologies, such as 5G, fast rail, large hydropower, long-distance power transmission, photovoltaics, electric vehicles, advanced computers, to name a few.  Global Times: Some have said that the US economy has been impeded by political dysfunction, and the US-led Indo-Pacific Economic Framework (IPEF) didn't perform well. However, many countries have recognized the China-proposed BRI as a success. What is the fundamental reason for this situation? What's the key to achieving a win-win result for both China and the US? Sachs: China is a high-saving country with a successful record of modern infrastructure investment, including thousands of kilometers of fast inter-city rail, 5G, long-distance power transmission, among others. The BRI aims to make these technologies available to China's trade partners, which is a win-win proposition. The US is a low-saving country which has not modernized much of its infrastructure in decades, for example, there is no fast rail, and EVs constitute a small proportion of new car sales. Also, the US political system is not very much interested in the low-income developing countries, whereas China is. And it also has practical experience and technologies to share with them. The US and EU should aim to cooperate with the BRI, for example in ASEAN countries and in Africa.     Global Times: APEC is an important organization for multilateral economic cooperation in the Asia-Pacific region. Under the intensifying tensions, what positive role will the APEC meeting play in the economy and development of the Asia-Pacific region?Sachs: If China and the US announce a return to cooperation, not only APEC countries but the entire world will breathe a huge sigh of relief. The US has caused these tensions with the idea of engaging in an economic war to ""contain"" China. This was a terrible and naïve idea. I hope that the US is ready to drop it, but this is clearly unlikely. There are still many US politicians that have a naïve, poorly informed anti-China attitude. Joe Biden should now use the APEC meeting to end the dangerous and misguided US policies of recent years.",OPINION,VIEWPOINT,Illustration: Chen Xia/Global Times,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{""30th APEC Economic Leaders ' Meeting"": ('MISC', 1), 'Times': ('MISC', 2), 'San Francisco': ('LOC', 2), 'China': ('LOC', 13), 'US': ('LOC', 18), 'Ukraine': ('LOC', 2), 'Gaza': ('LOC', 1), 'Israel': ('LOC', 1), 'West': ('LOC', 1), 'Xi Jinping': ('PER', 1), 'Joe Biden': ('PER', 2), 'Jeffrey Sachs': ('PER', 5), 'Wang Zixuan': ('PER', 1), 'Global Times': ('ORG', 4)}"
334,"Finding a better way for China, US to coexist",Victor Gao,2023-11-15,"The world looks toward the meeting in San Francisco between China President Xi Jinping and US President Joe Biden with high anticipations. The bilateral relations between China and the US have a direct bearing on almost everything in the world today. We are seeing a turning point in China-US ties. Whether the relations will move toward normalization and improvement or toward further deterioration will have a significant impact on global peace and development.It is the US that has invited the China head of state to not only participate in the APEC summit, but also have this meeting with President Joe Biden. This demonstrates that despite their differences, if both sides work together, they can achieve desirable results. China-US relations are of utmost importance. Even if some assume that it is heading toward a dead end, and there is no point for any optimism, we still need to exhibit the highest level of optimism we can muster. Giving up China-US relations means giving up the future of mankind. Therefore, despite the US government's capriciousness over the past few years, where their words and actions often differ, we still strive to make maximum efforts to convince them that there is a better way. There are possibilities for cooperation between China and the US, and we must guide Washington toward a positive direction, rather than allowing the US to veer dangerously off course.Based on this, we need to manage the risks and differences and maximize the potential benefits for the China people and the US people. The two countries need to solve whatever problems arise in peaceful ways and must never try to impose one's will on the other. If China and the US can achieve such a level of relationship, they will really see each other as a potential partner, rather than a potential enemy. Then the world we leave for our children will be a more peaceful and safer place.The most important thing between China and the US is to proclaim to the whole world the inevitability of peace between the two countries. We need to convince ourselves, as well as the rest of the world, that war should not be an option between China and the US. Moreover, many things can be done to benefit both China and the US. Several key issues need to be addressed. First, without China and the US taking actions in the same direction, mankind will fail to achieve its goal of containing the impact of climate change. Second, in terms of the development of AI, China and the US really need to think about how they can cooperate with each other rather than compete against each other. Third, regarding the Russia-Ukraine war and the Israel-Palestine conflict, if China and the US can align their stances, it will be much easier to achieve a settlement through negotiation and diplomacy. Fundamentally, I hope China and the US, through the meeting in San Francisco, can narrow their differences and recognize the importance of peace and stability. And I hope the summit meeting in San Francisco will lead to a realization, if not consensus, that China and the US should not view each other as enemies or rivals. The world is big enough to accommodate both China and the US in a cooperative way, rather than trying to harm one another.Now, the meeting means the top leaders in China and the US have the opportunity to make the right decisions. China-US relations can be viewed in a positive light, as Governor of California Gavin Newsom has declared to the whole world, ""the more successful China is, the more successful we all will be."" If this young, aspiring, and successful US politician can reach this conclusion, why can't everyone else? I'm not completely pessimistic about China-US relations. I still believe there are people in Washington with decency, dignity and enough intelligence, to see China for what it truly is. I'm also forcing myself to be optimistic about the medium-term and long-term prospects of China-US relations. I think there will come a time when China and the US can get along with each other despite their differences, with a prevailing trend of live and let live between the two countries. Let's keep the hope alive, and never surrender. The author is a chair professor at Soochow University and Vice President of the Center for China and Globalization. opinion@globaltimes.com.cn",OPINION,COLUMNISTS,China-US Photo: VCG,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'San Francisco': ('LOC', 1), 'China': ('LOC', 14), 'US': ('LOC', 16), 'Washington': ('LOC', 1), 'Xi Jinping': ('PER', 1), 'Joe Biden': ('PER', 2), 'APEC': ('ORG', 1)}"
335,"Europe shows 'fatigue' over Kiev supply, may shift toward compromise: experts",GT staff reporters,2023-11-15,"Despite Kiev's repeated calls for more support on the grinding battlefield, EU officials admitted on Tuesday that they may be failing their promise of providing Ukraine with the ammunition they need. Experts believe that as the latest Israel-Palestine conflict drags on and the Russia-Ukraine conflict reaches a stalemate, coupled with growing divergences within the EU over aid at the cost of squeezing their own budget, EU is making a shift in its stance and leaning toward negotiation and compromise.Germany Defense Minister Boris Pistorius acknowledged before a summit of EU defense ministers in Brussels that the EU will miss its previously stated target of supplying Ukraine with 1 million artillery shells and missiles by next March, marking the first such admission by a senior EU official, VOA reported on Tuesday. While reaffirming EU's unwavering support for Kiev, EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell also cast doubt on the goal, amid reservations from multiple members about committing up to $5 billion annually over four years as part of broader West security commitments to bolster Ukraine's defenses.EU is showing ""fatigue"" over Kiev recently in both its capabilities and public opinions, as the nearly 2-year-old conflict is in deadlock where the West's desired outcome of repelling Russia seems nowhere near succeeding, while the other goals set for the conflict, such as accelerating NATO's strategic transformation and warfare exercises, have been largely met, Sun Keqin, a research fellow at the China Institutes of Contemporary International Relations, told the Global Times on Wednesday.Therefore, the attitude of the West on the crisis has shown signs of shifting, becoming less radical and less confrontational, Sun noted, in what he believes is a transitional phase from the previous stance to a process of negotiation and compromise.Cui Heng, a scholar from the China National Institute for SCO International Exchange and Judicial Cooperation, said that EU's support for Ukraine would be further diluted, given not just the sudden outbreak of conflict in the Middle East, but future potential conflicts that the NATO believes may occur in East Asia. ""So, if we look at the whole picture, the 'investment' in Kiev will definitely decrease as they need to prepare for future strategic layouts,"" Cui told the Global Times on Wednesday.While the level of support may drop, aid to Ukraine will continue and remains the top strategic priority for EU as the conflict is happening ""right at their doorstep,"" and they perceive it as a direct and significant threat to EU security, experts said. Therefore, EU's support for Ukraine may come more from economic assistance than arms supply, Cui noted, especially after the suspension of Washington's economic aid to Kiev and the potential further reduction of aid if former US president Donald Trump reclaims power. The challenge now lies in how to convert the funds into the weapons that Ukraine requires, as it will not be easy to do so given there are only limited countries globally with such production capacity. Analysts believe that the failed promise of EU in providing weapons will make the situation even worse for Ukraine troops, but there will unlikely be any major breakthroughs to change the battlefield situation, as both sides have established comprehensive defense fortifications on the frontlines, and launching an attack would yield few favorable outcomes for either party.",CHINA,SOCIETY,Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky Photo:VCG,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'Kiev': ('LOC', 4), 'Ukraine': ('LOC', 6), 'Palestine': ('LOC', 1), 'Germany': ('LOC', 1), 'Brussels': ('LOC', 1), 'Middle East': ('LOC', 1), 'East Asia': ('LOC', 1), 'EU': ('ORG', 11), 'VOA': ('ORG', 1), 'NATO': ('ORG', 2), 'China Institutes of Contemporary International Relations': ('ORG', 1), 'Global Times': ('ORG', 1), 'China National Institute for SCO International Exchange and Judicial Cooperation': ('ORG', 1), 'Israel': ('MISC', 1), 'Russia': ('MISC', 2), 'West': ('MISC', 3), 'Boris Pistorius': ('PER', 1), 'Josep Borrell': ('PER', 1), 'Sun Keqin': ('PER', 2), 'Cui Heng': ('PER', 1)}"
336,Humanitarian crisis in Gaza 'may worsen' amid US sanctions against Hamas,Wang Qi,2023-11-15,"As Israel troops launched a ground assault on Al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza, the US and the UK announced coordinated sanctions targeting Hamas and its financiers, which China experts view is a move in support of Israel which could further exacerbate the humanitarian disaster by increasing Israel's disregard for the mounting international pressure.According to a press release from the US Department of Treasury on Tuesday (local time), the US imposed its third round of sanctions targeting Hamas-affiliated individuals and entities, including the group's senior leaders and the mechanisms through which Iran provides support to Hamas and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad (Palestinian Islamic Jihad).The US Department of Treasury said the designations are coordinated with action by the UK, which announced sanctions against four senior Hamas leaders and two Hamas financiers on Tuesday, and vowed to ""disrupt Hamas operations both in Gaza and wherever their leaders base themselves"" in coordination with the US. The US, UK and Israel are united in their war goals, which are the total elimination of Hamas and the destruction of the Hamas regime in Gaza, Niu Xinchun, a research fellow at the China Institute of Contemporary International Relations, told the Global Times on Wednesday.Yin Gang, a veteran scholar of the Middle East with the China Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times on Wednesday that the sanctions show the US' firm stance supporting Israel, and subsequently Hamas will encounter greater difficulties.The sanctions could mean that Israel will not further bow to international pressure for a cease-fire, Yin said, noting that the US may believe that the time has come to eliminate Hamas once and for all.Israel forces on Wednesday entered Al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza, after hours of bombarding the medical facility that is full of thousands of patients and sheltering civilians. Israel said Hamas has set up its command center in and beneath the hospital, which both Hamas and hospital staff denied, according to the AP. According to the health authority in Gaza, more than 11,200 people, two-thirds of them women and minors, have been killed since Israel launched a major air and ground offensive. ""The US is willing to provide Israel with all the assistance it needs to destroy Hamas, while at the same time the US demands that Israel reduce the humanitarian crisis.... But these two goals are contradictory and cannot be reconciled,"" Niu said.The UN humanitarian office said on Tuesday that more than two-thirds of Gaza's population of 2.3 million has fled their homes since the war began. At least 102 workers from the UN Relief and Works Agency in Gaza have been killed in Israel bombing.As long as there is no cease-fire, a deteriorating humanitarian crisis in Gaza is practically foreseeable, Niu said. ""There are only a few countries in the world, including the US and Israel, that do not agree to a cease-fire because they believe that Hamas cannot be eliminated with a cease-fire,"" he said.China Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said at a press briefing on Wednesday that China condemns all acts that harm civilians and opposes any violation of international law, and has repeatedly called for a cease-fire as soon as possible in order to avoid a more serious humanitarian catastrophe.We will continue to work with the parties concerned to play a positive and constructive role in order to cease the fighting, de-escalate the conflict, alleviate the humanitarian situation and ultimately realize lasting peace between Palestine and Israel through a two-state solution, Mao said.",CHINA,SOCIETY,"People are seen among the rubble of buildings destroyed in an Israeli bombing at Bureij refugee camp in central Gaza Strip, on Nov. 13, 2023.

340,China calls on the intl community to support the establishment of a Middle East zone free of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction,Global Times,2023-11-14,"China supports the establishment of a Middle East zone free of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction and believes that this move will help curb the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, safeguard the authority and effectiveness of international non-proliferation regimes, and reduce the risk of an arms race and conflict, thereby providing an important mechanism for the maintenance of long-term regional peace and security, China’s deputy permanent representative to the UN Geng Shuang said in remarks at the Fourth Session of the Conference on the Establishment of a Middle East Zone Free of Nuclear Weapons and other Weapons of Mass Destruction on Monday. According to Geng, there have been three successful sessions of this conference which is taking place at a time when the Palestinian-Israeli Conflict is intensifying. Given the current context, the international community should make greater efforts to support the establishment of a Middle East zone free of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction, which is of great urgency and relevance in facilitating reconciliation and cooperation among regional countries in the Middle East and advancing the Middle East peace process, Geng said. Geng noted that peace and security in the Middle East impacts not only the interests of regional states, but also global stability. In response to the current global and regional security dilemma, China maintains that the international community should adhere to the concept of common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security, insist on building a balanced, effective, and sustainable international security architecture, and adhere to a new path to security that features dialogue over confrontation, partnership over alliances, and win-win over zero-sum. This is one of China’s main areas of focus in eliminating the root causes of international conflicts and achieving durable stability and security in the region.According to Geng, the Middle East question, with its intertwined historical and practical contradictions, cannot be resolved overnight. It requires all parties to uphold the concept of common security, adhere to the principle of indivisibility of security, and gradually shape a favorable political and diplomatic atmosphere. Countries in the region should strengthen their solidarity and coordination and forge mutual trust and consensus. Certain country outside the region should abandon their narrow geopolitical interests and political manipulation, stop deliberately provoking confrontation in the region, and make practical contributions to the maintenance of regional security, Geng said. Maintaining the authority and effectiveness of the international nuclear non-proliferation regime is crucial to the establishment of a nuclear weapon free zone in the Middle East. The countries of the region concerned should accede to international conventions such as the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC), and the Biological Weapons Convention (BWC) as soon as possible and should strictly abide by their treaty obligations, Geng said. Recently, comments by Israel officials on the use of nuclear weapons in the Gaza  caused an uproar. China was shocked by statements and expressed concern. The Israel statements were universally condemned. It is extremely irresponsible and disturbing. Such statements run counter to the international consensus that a nuclear war cannot be won and must not be fought, on contrary to the international spirit of establishing a Middle East zone free of nuclear weapons, and go against the overwhelming international call to deescalate, cease hostilities, and protect civilians, Geng noted. China urges Israel officials to retract these statements, and we urge Israel to accede to the treaty on the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons as a non-nuclear weapon state as soon as possible and to place all its nuclear facilities under IAEA safeguards, Geng said. According to Geng, China firmly commits to a nuclear strategy of self-defense. Since it first acquired nuclear weapons, China pledged not to use nuclear weapons first at any time or under any circumstances, and not to use or threaten to use nuclear weapons against non-nuclear weapon states and nuclear weapon free zones unconditionally. It is the only nuclear weapon state to have made the above commitments. China advocates that pending the complete prohibition and thorough destruction of nuclear weapons, all nuclear weapons states should undertake not to be the first to use nuclear weapons and not to use nuclear weapons against non-nuclear weapon states and nuclear weapon free zones, Geng said. Meanwhile, special Envoy of the China Government on the Middle East Issue Zhai Jun met with Turkey Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan and exchanged opinions on the Israel-Palestine conflicts during a visit in Türkiye on Monday. According to Zhai, the international community should take prompt action and seek an immediate ceasefire to prevent the situation from further deterioration or risk the situation getting out of control, urge the conflicting parties to strictly adhere to international humanitarian law, exert every effort to protect civilians and prevent a larger-scale humanitarian disaster, and intensify diplomatic efforts to bring the crisis back to the track of political resolution. Türkiye serves an influential power as a Middle Eastern and Islamic country. China is willing to strengthen communication and coordination with Türkiye, working together with Türkiye to contribute efforts toward a comprehensive, just and long-lasting solution to the Palestine issue, Zhai said. Global Times",CHINA,DIPLOMACY,"Geng Shuang, China's deputy permanent representative to the UN.

341,"Anti-violence, not antisemitism: the real reason behind China’s online outrage over Israel’s actions",Xin Ping,2023-11-14,"The recent Israel-Palestine conflict has sparked a wave of online comments and reactions in China, some of which have been labeled as antisemitic by West media outlets such as the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal. However, these accusations are based on a misunderstanding of the China context and perspective, and a failure to recognize the legitimate concerns and grievances of the China people regarding the violence and injustice in the Middle East.Criticism is not hatred. The majority of the China online comments, accused by NYT and WSJ as antisemitic, are not directed at Jews as a whole, but at Israel's policies and actions in the occupied Palestine territories. These comments are triggered by countless heart-broken pictures and footage by global media showing the miserable situation in Gaza and the tragedies that the Palestine are experiencing every day. They are motivated by a sense of justice and conscience from the perspective of most people. This sentiment is not unique to China netizens, but shared by the majority of people across the world who oppose the violent and brutal actions targeted at civilians in Gaza.The anger and resentment expressed in the China cyberspace are not based on prejudice, but on solid evidence and legal basis. It is clear to anyone with a minimum knowledge of law that Israel, as one side of the conflict, has violated many of the norms and principles in international law and international humanitarian law. These include the prohibition of the use of force, the protection of civilians and civilian objects, the respect for the right to life, the prohibition of collective punishment, the obligation to ensure the basic needs of the occupied population and the illegality of the settlements and the annexation of territory.The terrible circumstances that the Palestine people encountered might have won more sympathy from the China netizens than from others. As a group of people who have historically been subjected to foreign invasion, occupation and humiliation, they can empathize more with the plight of the Palestine, who are seen as the victims of oppression and human rights violations by the Israelis. This is nothing about nationalism, even less about prejudice against the Israelis. This is about solidarity with those who are fighting for their national liberation and independence. For the majority of the China people, they believe all lives are precious and condemn all acts that harm and endanger civilians. They wish for no more wars in the world, and believe violence cannot bring durable peace and that retaliations will only result in more deaths and hatred. The China online comments condemning Israel for its violence and injustice are not antisemitic, but anti-violence. They are not driven by a certain perception of Jews, but by a certain perception of reality. They are not manifestations of hatred, but manifestations of compassion and justice. They are not aimed at harming or discriminating against Jews, but at supporting and defending the rights and dignity of the Palestine.Regretfully, the op-eds on NYT and WSJ failed to recognize the mainstream view in China's cyberspace about the conflict in Gaza. They cherry-picked a few sensational comments and tried to smear or silence the majority of the China people who have a justified and reasonable position on the Israel-Palestine conflict, and who have the right to express their views and feelings on social media platforms.When judging the merits in the Israel-Palestine conflict, we need to take a fair stand out of justice and humanitarian concern, instead of one out of ideology or racism, especially when the situation continues to escalate and more civilians are dying from Israel airstrikes. Antisemitism, as a form of racism which could easily and dangerously arouse hatred, shall not be tolerated. Equally, trying to label those voices calling for humanitarian treatment toward the Palestine as antisemitism and silence them shall not be tolerated. To fake up a scenario to incite hostility between the China people and the Jews is not only dishonest but also wicked.

343,Will Cameron’s appointment be a chance for China-UK relations to get back on track?,Mark Blacklock,2023-11-14,"David Cameron's appointment as Britain's new foreign secretary has the potential to breathe new life into the China-UK relationship which has in recent years experienced some serious setbacks. But because of the continuous internal political fighting within the ruling Tory party, it is also possible that China will become the focus of negative attention from critics who will use his unique understanding of China to attack him.As a former British prime minister whose administration focused positively on fostering closer and mutually beneficial ties with Beijing, he is well positioned to engage with a country he came to comprehend well during his time in Downing Street.The connections go back at least a decade. In 2013, he was part of a UK business delegation which returned from China with multi-billion-dollar worth of trade deals in its pockets. The following year, Cameron hosted the then China premier Li Keqiang on a visit to London. In October 2015, he welcomed President Xi Jinping during a highly successful state visit, during which the two statesmen bonded at a visit to Cameron's grand official country residence, Chequers. They also enjoyed a pint of beer and fish and chips at The Plough pub in the nearby hamlet of Gadsden, South Buckinghamshire. Cameron returned to Beijing in 2017 to reinforce links between the two nations, followed by another visit a year later.It was, as has been well-publicized, the dawn of a ""golden era"" of warm relations between China and the UK. Or it could have been, had it lasted. Unfortunately, it didn't, partly due to the malign influence of Washington, which did not like an ally forming closer ties with China. Additionally, a Sino-phobic hard right-wing element within the UK's ruling Tory party, which ideologically deplores China's communist system, played a role in derailing the relationship. They view any engagement with China as a sign of weakness, or even treachery.  Now that Cameron, who led the UK between 2010 and 2016, has returned to frontline politics it is reasonable to speculate whether the warm relations will get back on track.As Cameron is now Britain's top diplomat - now to be officially known as Lord Cameron - he will have the wars in Gaza and Ukraine high on his agenda. However, in the longer term, dealing with China will take up a great deal of his time. During the period between his previous public role and now, the UK's relationship with Beijing has deteriorated. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has spun so often and so rapidly between pragmatic engagement with Beijing and demonization of Beijing, leaving uncertainty about his stance.From being someone who, as chancellor, sought to develop trade links in a spirit of ""pragmatic engagement,"" pushed to improve business relationships and was behind a drive to re-establish the UK-China Economic and Financial Dialogue in 2021, he became someone who, as prime minister, said the golden era was over and that it was ""naive"" to seek closer economic links. It was all part of pandering to his party's influential hard right. In July 2022, while seeking his party's leadership - and seeking to garner the support of the reactionary right - Sunak said China was Britain's ""biggest long-term threat"" and pledged to shut all of Britain's 30 Confucius institutes (though this was later quietly dropped) to reign in its soft power.By contrast, Cameron in 2013 declared after meeting with Xi Jinping: ""I told President Xi Jinping the rise of China would be a defining fact of the 21st century."" Sunak would have been aware of this when he appointed Cameron this week, and it would be good for the UK if London were to once again aspire to be Beijing's partner.Cameron has a lot to build on. He has vast experience on which to fall back on, but he has also retained an interest, and involvement, in geopolitical affairs in the region in a personal capacity since leaving office. Furthermore, his predecessor James Cleverly laid the foundations for an improved relationship during a visit to China in August. Although his approach was clumsy and at time contradictory, it was a tentative first step toward thawing the frosty diplomatic atmosphere between the two countries and developing a productive rapport. He spoke of the need for a constructive relationship. This is a path which is sure to antagonize Washington, as the UK seeks engagement with China. It will also provoke the usual China hawks within the Conservative Party who will use Cameron's close China links against him, reinforcing damaging stereotypes to attack China in the process.These attacks should be expected, and are as predictable as day following night. However, the gains from closer relations between Beijing and London will far outweigh the losses represented by noisy critics.The author is a journalist and lecturer living in Britain. opinion@globaltimes.com.cn",OPINION,VIEWPOINT,China UK Photo: VCG,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'David Cameron': ('PER', 7), 'Li Keqiang': ('PER', 1), 'Xi Jinping': ('PER', 1), 'Britain': ('LOC', 2), 'China': ('LOC', 10), 'UK': ('LOC', 6), 'Beijing': ('LOC', 3), 'Downing Street': ('LOC', 1), 'London': ('LOC', 1), 'Chequers': ('LOC', 1), 'The Plough': ('LOC', 1), 'Gadsden': ('LOC', 1), 'South Buckinghamshire': ('LOC', 1), 'Washington': ('LOC', 1), 'Gaza': ('LOC', 1), 'Ukraine': ('LOC', 1), 'Tory': ('ORG', 2), 'British': ('MISC', 1), 'Sino': ('MISC', 1)}"
344,Chinese aviation equipment attracts Middle Eastern interest at Dubai Airshow,Liu Xuanzun,2023-11-14,"A wide selection of China defense products, including fighter jets and drones, are on offer to international customers at an ongoing aviation expo in the Middle East. Military experts expect Saudi Arabia countries to show a strong interest in weapons and equipment from China amid restrictions from other suppliers.The state-owned Aviation Industry Corporation of China (AVIC) has brought a full spectrum of China aviation products, including fighters, helicopters, trainers, transport aircraft and drones, to the 18th Dubai Airshow, which is being held from Monday to Friday in the UAE, AVIC said in a press release on Tuesday.At the indoor booth, AVIC is displaying advanced aviation equipment such as the FC-31 stealth fighter jet, the Y-20 strategic transport aircraft, the Z-20 tactical utility helicopter, as well as unmanned aerial vehicles, including the Wing Loong-X and the Wing Loong-2 fixed wing drones and the AR-36 vertical takeoff and landing drone.In the center of the AVIC booth are full-scale models of the AR-2000 and AR-500W unmanned helicopters, with the AR-2000 being exhibited at an overseas expo for the first time, AVIC said.With its rotor blades folded, the AR-2000 is equipped with an electro-optical pod under its nose, a maritime search radar under its chin, and three missiles under one side of its short horizontal wing, giving a strong indication that it was designed for shipborne operations, observers said.Huang Guozhi, a China military expert who visited the Dubai Airshow on Monday, told the Global Times that AVIC is the largest China defense firm exhibiting at the Dubai Airshow and its products are very representative of the China aviation industry.The Y-20 model on display is an upgraded version that is equipped with large bypass ratio turbofan engines, while a model of the J-10CE fighter jet is also on display in tandem with flight performances by J-10C fighter jets from the China People's Liberation Army (PLA) Air Force Bayi Aerobatic Team, Huang said.The flight performances will give potential customers in the Gulf region a better understanding on the capabilities of the J-10C, Huang said.In the air, the Bayi Aerobatic Team's J-10C fighter jets, the L-15 advanced trainer jet that has already won a purchase contract from the UAE, and the JF-17 fighter jet from the Pakistan Air Force delivered flight performances on the opening day of the airshow, marking the first time these three types of warplanes domestically developed by China have delivered simultaneous flight performances at an aviation expo abroad, AVIC said.On the ground, an upgraded version of the L-15 painted with colors from the UAE national flag and possessing an active electronic scanning array (AESA) radar is on static display. Meanwhile, a Pakistan Air Force JF-17 Block 3, the latest version of the JF-17, is also on static display along with its airborne munitions.China defense products are an attractive option in the international market because they offer both high quality and high cost-efficiency, with no unreasonable political strings attached, Fu Qianshao, a China military aviation expert, told the Global Times on Tuesday.Middle Eastern countries are long customers of China defense products like drones, and now they are looking at options for fighter jets, a market once dominated mainly by the US and EU, Fu said.But with the latest Palestine-Israel conflict among other geopolitical reasons, Saudi Arabia countries can no longer acquire advanced fighter jets from the West, while the availability of Russia fighter jets is also in question due to the Russia-Ukraine conflict, analysts said, noting that this situation presents China with a good market opportunity as the country also has good relations with all the countries in the region.Now that the UAE has purchased the L-15 advanced trainer jet, it is possible that Middle Eastern countries will consider the JF-17, the J-10C or even the FC-31, Fu said. ""Having advanced technologies and sufficient production capacity, there are high hopes that China can become the main supplier of aviation equipment in the Middle East,"" he said.China's arms exports are win-win cooperation that aims to provide other countries with means to carry out their independent defense policies and to safeguard regional peace and stability, unlike the US that ties arms exports with political strings to maintain its global military hegemony, experts said.",CHINA,MILITARY,"The state-owned Aviation Industry Corporation of China displays a full spectrum of Chinese aviation products, including fighters, helicopters, trainers, transport aircraft and drones, at the 18th Dubai Airshow held in the UAE from November 13 to 17, 2023.

345,China continues to push for cease-fire in Gaza,Yang Sheng,2023-11-14,"The situation of the Palestine-Israel conflict remains horrific as the death toll of Palestine has risen to 11,240 as a result of Israel's attacks on the Gaza and as the UN lowered the flags of its institutions all over the world for the 101 staff killed so far during the war in Gaza. China is continuing its efforts in the UN and is dispatching diplomats to visit countries with influence to seek a cease-fire and promote peace in the region.Special Envoy of the China Government on the Middle East Issue Zhai Jun and Turkey Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan met on Monday in Ankara to discuss the latest developments in the Gaza, according to a release from the China Foreign Ministry. During the meeting, Zhai said in the face of the current crisis, the top priority is to immediately impose a cease-fire to prevent further escalation. Zhai said China is willing to strengthen communication and coordination with Turkey, and make joint efforts to promote a comprehensive, just, and lasting solution to the Palestine issue. Fidan stated that Turkey attaches importance to China's role and is willing to maintain close communication and coordination with China to jointly promote an early end to the conflict and achieve lasting peace in the region.Geng Shuang, China's deputy permanent representative to the UN, on Monday also made remarks at the Fourth Session of the Conference on the Establishment of a Middle East Zone Free of Nuclear Weapons and other Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMDs), saying that nuclear weapons and other WMDs have been a major factor causing a trust deficit in the Middle East, undermining regional peace and stability. 

A UN flag flies at half-mast at the UN headquarters in New York on November 13, 2023. UN lowered the flags of its institutions all over the world for the 101 staff killed so far during the conflict in Gaza. Photo: AFPAfter the outbreak of the latest Palestine-Israel conflict, some voices from Israel, including senior politicians like Israel Heritage Minister Amihai Eliyahu, who said the use of nuclear weapons in Gaza is an option, have prompted heavy criticism from the international community and once again raised international concern over nuclear proliferation in the region, analysts said.The ongoing Gaza crisis has exposed the problem of dysfunction in the UN due to the irresponsible acts of the US, and Middle East countries might face the danger of an arm races as they are concerned that the geo-political balance and security mechanism are collapsing, said Liu Zhongmin, a professor at the Middle East Studies Institute of Shanghai International Studies University.""So at this moment, China, as the permanent member of the UN and a nuclear-armed power, needs to play a responsible role to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons and other WMDs in the region,"" said Wang Jin, an associate professor at the Institute of Middle Eastern Studies of Northwest University.  Geng said on Monday that ""Recently, what the Israel officials said about the use of nuclear weapons in the Gaza has caused an uproar. China was shocked by statements of this kind and expressed its concern. These kind of statements are universally condemned. It is extremely irresponsible and disturbing. Such statements run counter to the international consensus that a nuclear war cannot be won and must not be fought, in contrary to the international spirit of establishing a Middle East zone free of nuclear weapons, and go against the overwhelming international call to de-escalate, cease hostilities and protect civilians."" ""We urge Israel officials to retract these statements, and urge Israel to accede to the treaty on the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons as a non-nuclear weapon state as soon as possible and to place all its nuclear facilities under IAEA safeguards,"" Geng noted. Israel is a nuclear-armed country with US acquiescence, so if Israel wants to legitimize its nuclear-armed status during its war against Gaza, this will definitely force other major regional powers like Iran and Saudi Arabia to get rid of the restrictions of the non-proliferation treaty. The region will then face a new round of nuclear-proliferation, and this is why China needs to speak out and warn the region of such dangers, experts noted.  Due to the worsening situation, all China nationals have left Gaza safely, China Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said at a routine press conference on Tuesday.According to the UN official website, ""From the hustle and bustle of New York City to the edge of the Karura Forest in Kenya's capital, Nairobi, offices across the global UN system paid tribute on Monday to the 101 staff killed so far during the war raging in Gaza - the largest loss during a conflict in the Organization's 78-year history.""The death toll of Palestine has risen to 11,240 as a result of Israel's attacks on the Gaza since October 7, the Hamas-run government media office in Gaza said Monday, the Xinhua reported on Monday.China analysts said that although the international community keeps calling for an immediate cease-fire, the conflict is still far from ending with a growing death toll of civilians and UN staff. A key reason is that Israel does not receive enough pressure from the international community, and the US still one-sidedly justifies Israel's operations under the pretext of ""self-defense"" while the operations have already inflicted a great loss of civilian life.",CHINA,DIPLOMACY,"People are seen among the rubble of buildings destroyed in an Israeli bombing at Bureij refugee camp in central Gaza Strip, on Nov. 13, 2023.

348,US maneuvers to stabilize China ties: genuine diplomacy or crisis management?,Danny Haiphong,2023-11-13,"China President Xi Jinping and US President Joe Biden will meet on the sidelines of the APEC Economic Leaders' Meeting in San Francisco, California. The meeting comes amid several high-profile visits between the two sides in recent weeks. At first glance, these encounters indicate that relations are headed in the right direction. However, a closer look at the behavior of the Joe Biden administration calls into question the sincerity of the US side. On the one hand, the US has made efforts to increase its emphasis on cooperation with China. US President Joe Biden said during his meeting with China foreign minister Wang Yi at the end of October that the two countries must work together to address global challenges. However, Xi Jinping's words to Joe Biden that he hoped the US would match words with actions during their last meeting at the G20 summit in Bali have yet to be heeded.The Joe Biden administration has maintained the Donald Trump-era trade war which has come at great cost to US businesses. Sanctions on China's tech sector also remain in full effect, with Joe Biden enacting an export ban and an investment ban this past summer. Furthermore, China has been compelled to remind the US of its commitments to the one-China Principle under the three China-US joint communiqués. The Joe Biden administration has continued to send arms and political support to ""pro-independence"" forces in Taiwan island, leading the BBC to declare that the US is ""quietly arming Taiwan to the teeth"" through the Foreign Military Finance (FMF) program - the same program the Joe Biden administration has used to send arms to Ukraine in its proxy war there.The US also finds itself mired in several geopolitical crises that threaten domestic and global stability. In Ukraine, the US has spent more than $100 billion provoking a dangerous conflict with Russia. US officials and West media have reached consensus that the conflict in Ukraine is now a stalemate. US and NATO efforts to make a breakthrough against Russia vis-a-vis Ukraine's counteroffensive have failed. This has facilitated a reduction in funding for the conflict as domestic support for the proxy war wanes.The US is also heavily invested in Israel's brutal war in Gaza where an estimated 15,000 Palestine have been killed, including about 5,000 children. A worldwide demand has emerged for a ceasefire in hostilities. The Joe Biden administration has opposed a ceasefire and has instead sent aircraft carriers to the Mediterranean plus additional funding and weapons to Israel. This has laid bare the US' ongoing aim to maintain and expand its hegemony in the Middle East. In doing so, the Joe Biden administration faces grave risks to its legitimacy. Over 60 percent of US voters support a ceasefire in Gaza. Increased military involvement from the Joe Biden administration risks damaging the US' global standing and worse, regional war.Gaza and Ukraine are two major geopolitical crises which are ultimately a byproduct of imperial overreach as the US economic, political and military order, what many observers have called a modern-day empire, declines in both size and influence. Easing relations with China thus presents an opportunity for the US to ease pressure on itself. China and the world at large must exercise caution when the US engages in diplomacy without making any meaningful commitments to reverse counterproductive and aggressive policies that are responsible for bringing China-US relations to a low point in the first place.China and the US' bilateral relationship is perhaps the world's most important relationship. The meeting between Xi Jinping and Joe Biden at the APEC meeting marks a critical juncture for the future of global stability. Issues on the agenda such as the crisis in Gaza, Ukraine and bilateral issues relating to trade and cross-Straits relations hold broad significance. The quality of the China-US relationship can change the world for the better or for the worse. The meeting between Xi Jinping and Joe Biden is another opportunity to set relations on the right course. Still, the intense geopolitical and domestic crises that plague the US will inevitably influence policy in Washington in the months leading up to the 2024 presidential election. The future has yet to be written, but until the US matches words with actions, it is likely that an intensification of the US' so-called ""China containment"" policy looms on the horizon.The author is an independent journalist in the US and co-editor of Friends of Socialist China. opinion@globaltimes.com.cn",OPINION,VIEWPOINT,Illustration: Xia Qing/GT,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'China': ('LOC', 6), 'US': ('LOC', 14), 'San Francisco': ('LOC', 1), 'California': ('LOC', 1), 'Bali': ('LOC', 1), 'Taiwan': ('LOC', 2), 'Ukraine': ('LOC', 4), 'Russia': ('LOC', 2), 'West': ('LOC', 1), 'Israel': ('LOC', 1), 'Gaza': ('LOC', 1), 'Palestine': ('LOC', 1), 'B': ('LOC', 1), 'Xi Jinping': ('PER', 2), 'Joe Biden': ('PER', 9), 'Wang Yi': ('PER', 1), ""APEC Economic Leaders ' Meeting"": ('MISC', 1), 'G20': ('MISC', 1), 'Donald Trump': ('MISC', 1), 'one - China Prinple': ('MISC', 1), 'Foreign': ('MISC', 1), 'Finance': ('MISC', 1), 'BBC': ('ORG', 1), 'Military': ('ORG', 1), 'FM': ('ORG', 1), 'NATO': ('ORG', 1)}"

350,Chinese FM urges immediate cease-fire amid dire Gaza situation,Yang Sheng,2023-11-13,"China on Monday praised the contribution to calls for a ceasefire and humanitarian assistance for the ongoing Palestine-Israel conflict made by the Saudi Arabia-African summit and Saudi Arabia-Islamic summit, held in Saudi Arabia, saying that China will continue to work with the relevant parties to protect civilians, ease tensions, restart negotiations, and strive tirelessly for peace.  China analysts said the international community has already sent enough messages on ""the call for ceasefire"", but in order to realize an immediate ceasefire when Israel ignores all calls and warnings to halt its military operations in Gaza, the world, or at least countries in the region that care about the humanitarian situation of Palestine, also needs measures to impose concrete constraints on Israel..However, it seems that Saudi Arabia and Islamic countries do not have a consensus in transforming their call for peace into real actions to force Israel to stop the brutal war, so unfortunately the conflict will continue and the death toll will keep rising, while China will not give up and keep making efforts to promote peace, analysts said.  Stand togetherChinese Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Mao Ning said at a routine press conference on Monday, ""The current situation in the Gaza is quite dire, and China supports all efforts aimed at de-escalating the conflict and restoring peace."" More than 11,000 Palestine, two-thirds of them women and children, have been killed since the war began, according to the Health Ministry in Gaza. About 2,700 people have been reported missing and are thought to be trapped or dead under the rubble, Al Jazeera reported on Monday.The Saudi Arabia-African Summit and the Joint Saudi Arabia-Islamic Extraordinary Summit, which were recently held in Riyadh, ""have sent a clear message of promoting a ceasefire, protecting civilians, increasing humanitarian assistance, and implementing the 'two-state solution,' and we welcome these efforts,"" Mao said.The Saudi Arabia-Islamic summit called for an end to the war in Gaza and rejected the justification of Israel's actions against Palestine as self-defense. The summit on Saturday condemned ""Israel aggression on the Gaza, war crimes and barbaric and inhumane massacres by the occupation government,"" a final communiqué of the summit said. The leaders demanded that the UN adopt ""a decisive and binding resolution"" to halt Israel's ""aggression"" in Gaza.Originally, only the 22 members of the Saudi Arabia League were expected to participate, but the meeting was later expanded to include the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), a wider association of 57 mostly Muslim-majority states to which the Saudi Arabia League countries belong, according to Al Jazeera.Mao noted that since the Palestinian-Israeli Conflict broke out, China has been in close communication with relevant parties to call for ceasefire and restoration of peace. On halting the current conflict, China's position is very much similar to that of the vast Saudi Arabia, Islamic and African developing countries. ""China will work with relevant parties to continue to work relentlessly to protect civilians, deescalate the situation, resume talks for peace and realize peace,"" said the spokesperson.Liu Zhongmin, a professor at the Middle East Studies Institute of Shanghai International Studies University, told the Global Times on Monday that ""the most feasible way for the international community to force Israel to stop is to pass resolutions in the UN and to impose constraints on Israel, so that the pressure will be meaningful, otherwise condemnation and words are definitely not enough.""However, with the US' absolute support, Israel doesn't care about the UN, and the latest summit in Riyadh shows that Saudi Arabia and Islamic countries failed to reach agreement on taking concrete actions, all of which sent a clear message to Israel: international pressure is limited, said Ma Xiaolin, dean of the Institute for Studies on the Mediterranean Rim at Zhejiang International Studies University.Washington wants to avoid being criticized by the international community and is also afraid of offending Israel, so it is now calling on it not to target facilities like hospitals and avoid collateral damage on civilians, but has staunchly refused to call for a ceasefire, Ma told the Global Times. ""However, this cannot be done, because as long as Israel continues its operation, the civilian death toll will definitely rise.""More tragediesMao said at the press conference that ""The humanitarian situation in the region has been extremely dire for over a month. The struggling Dar Al-Shifa Hospital is an epitome of the ongoing humanitarian crisis in Gaza."" Israel forces reached the gates of Gaza's main hospital on Monday, the primary target in their battle to seize control of the northern half of the Gaza, where medics said patients including newborn babies were dying for lack of fuel, Reuters reported on Monday.China urges all parties involved to immediately cease fire, protect civilians, increase humanitarian assistance, and alleviate the humanitarian crisis, Mao said, noting that the international community should take concrete measures and make greater efforts to address this issue, she noted.Israel ground forces entered Gaza in late October and have quickly encircled Gaza, the main settlement in the north. Fighting has since been concentrated in a tightening circle around the Al Shifa hospital, the biggest in Gaza, where thousands of civilians sought shelter, Reuters reported. Israel says Hamas fighters have an underground headquarters in tunnels beneath the hospital and are deliberately using its patients as a shield, which Hamas denies. Gaza Health Ministry spokesperson Ashraf Al-Qidra, who was inside the Al Shifa hospital in Gaza, said an Israel tank was now stationed at the hospital gate, according to media reports. There was also fresh concern that the war could spread beyond Gaza, with an upsurge of clashes on Israel's northern border with Lebanon, and the US launching air strikes on Iran-linked militia targets in neighboring Syria.China analysts said the conflict will continue, and if Hamas receives no meaningful support from outside or no new conflict breaks out in other areas that could effectively trouble Israel, it will be just a matter of time before it realizes its military occupation of Gaza and Hamas will lose control in the region. But after about 11,000 people having been killed, maybe more in the future, how Israel will be able to handle a Gaza full of hatred and tears will raise a new question.",WORLD,MID-EAST,"A staff worker disinfects temporary shelters in the southern Gaza Strip city of Khan Younis, on Nov. 12, 2023.

351,Bombing of Gaza hospitals crosses the humanitarian bottom line: Global Times editorial,Global Times,2023-11-13,"The whole world is witnessing a human nightmare unfold in Gaza: Al-Shifa Hospital, the largest hospital in Gaza, is bombed and surrounded by tanks, and temporarily cut off from the outside world. As a result of a fuel shortage, the death toll of critically ill patients and premature infants keeps rising, and ""the hospital no longer functions as a hospital."" On November 13, an Israel tank ""is outside the gate of the outpatient clinic department,"" and ""almost all"" hospitals in northern Gaza have stopped services. The current death toll in Palestine has exceeded 11,000, with approximately 40 percent being children. The World Health Organization states that one child dies every 10 minutes. Regardless of how the warring parties justify their actions, this scene will become an indelible scar in the history of human civilization.Israel claimed that they do not target medical facilities and that the headquarters of Hamas is sited in bunkers under Al-Shifa Hospital. It accused Hamas of using patients and medical staff as ""human shields."" But Hamas denied this allegation. In the absence of concrete evidence and with Israel's overwhelming military strength, images related to Al-Shifa Hospital have broken through the blockade and spread worldwide. This has resulted in an outpouring of international sympathy for Gaza civilians and strong calls for an immediate ceasefire. Although determining right from wrong in a war is sometimes challenging, the moral balance is clear when the situation in Gaza has reached such a point. Making a moral judgment on this matter is not difficult.Regardless of the words and actions, the basic principles stipulated by international humanitarian law, international human rights law, and various conventions must never be blurred or deviate from. The fundamental principle that the wounded and sick, civilians, medical personnel, ambulances and healthcare facilities should be protected is the clearest and most basic criterion. It is also the bottom line of human civilization. Whoever touches upon this bottom line, regardless of the reasons, the nature of the behavior undergoes a fundamental change.According to the local health department, Al-Shifa Hospital has over 600 patients, including 40 premature infants in incubators. Due to the paralysis of hospital equipment, doctors are forced to move the premature babies from the incubators, wrap them in foil and place them next to hot water to keep them alive.Such shocking details and images have undoubtedly brought immense public opinion and moral pressure to the conflicting parties. There have been several incidents in world history where a single photograph changed the course of a war. Now, every passing second in the Gaza hospital crisis signifies the loss of lives, and there is an urgent need for a larger-scale mobilization and organization of international calls for ceasefire and peace.However, it is regrettable to see that the US and its closest West allies currently still maintain an ambiguous stance. On one hand, they insist on not ""immediately ceasing fire"" in the name of the so-called fight against terrorism, emphasizing Israel's ""right to self-defense,"" even though such attacks have far exceeded the scope of ""self-defense."" On the other hand, under the strong pressure of international public opinion and morality, they make statements like ""we don't want to see firefights in hospitals."" However, the humanitarian disaster in Gaza has shocked the entire international community, and Washington's related statements so far have been light and even perfunctory. Its loud voice in support of Israel's ""right to self-defense"" and its casual treatment of the humanitarian crisis undoubtedly form a stark contrast, making people clearly see what their claimed ""rules-based international order"" really is.It is no longer a question of whether the escalating humanitarian disaster in the Gaza should be stopped, but rather how to prevent the tragedy. It is obvious that as long as the artillery continues, the suffering there will only worsen, and it should not be so difficult for the international community to reach a basic consensus on this matter. In the face of a humanitarian disaster, the choice between pursuing one's own political self-interest or upholding morality and conscience not only tests the conflicting parties but also tests the US-led West countries, which claim to prioritize human rights.",OPINION,EDITORIAL,"Palestinians including children are brought to Nasser Hospital for treatment after Israeli attack in Khan Yunis, Gaza on November 13, 2023.

352,"Chinese envoy urges immediate ceasefire between Israel, Palestine",Xinhua,2023-11-12,"China permanent representative to the UN, Zhang Jun, on Friday called for an immediate ceasefire between Israel and Palestine.""A ceasefire and an end to the fighting cannot be delayed. A ceasefire is by no means a diplomatic statement. It is the only hope for the people of Gaza to survive,"" Zhang told the UN emergency meeting on the Palestinian-Israeli Conflict situation.Noting that the current round of conflict has been going on for 35 days and the situation continues to deteriorate, he said: ""We call on all parties, especially the major power that has a unique influence on the parties, to put aside all geopolitical considerations and double standards and focus all efforts on the goal of a ceasefire and an end to the fight. We urge Israel to curb the intensifying settler violence in the West Bank so as to avoid the concurring hotspot and the spread of conflict.""""When tens of thousands of people, including more than 4,000 children, have lost their lives; when more than 1.6 million people have been forced to flee their homes; when 2.3 million people continue to be cut off from water, electricity, fuel, food and medicine; and when hospitals, schools, refugee camps, and UN facilities have been frequently targeted, this is not only a humanitarian crisis, but, as described by UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, a crisis of humanity,"" he added.Zhang said he met with representatives of Palestine and other Saudi Arabia countries and those from the Organization of Islamic Cooperation earlier in the day.""From our conversation, I was deeply struck by the pain they have deep in their hearts, by their hope for the resumption of peace, and by their expectation for the Council to take effective actions,"" he said.""In the face of all this, the world must speak out together: Enough is enough,"" Zhang said, adding that ""the UN must do away with the obstruction and interference of some members and take immediate, responsible, and meaningful action to uphold justice and maintain peace.""Stressing the importance of protecting civilians, the envoy said, ""We condemn all violence and attacks against civilians. We express our grave concern over and strong opposition to the clear violations of international humanitarian law in Gaza.""""We urge an end to the collective punishment of civilians. We demand the safety and humanitarian needs of hostages be guaranteed and call for diplomatic efforts to facilitate their early release,"" he added.More than 1,300 children and their families are trapped in the rubble with their lives at stake, Zhang said, adding, ""We support the Council to take emergency actions in this regard to facilitate a sustained truce of multiple days and an immediate opening of a green corridor for specialized agencies and equipment to enter Gaza to carry out search and rescue operations, so as to do our utmost to save children.""The Council should also respond to the joint appeal made by the Director-General of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, and Marwan Jilani, Director General of the Palestine Red Crescent Society, to establish a medical evacuation mechanism so that pregnant women and the seriously injured and sick in Gaza can be transferred and treated promptly, he continued.Zhang also called for the delivery of supplies to resume, noting it ""cannot be delayed.""""We call on Israel to immediately lift the siege and completely remove restrictions on livelihood supplies, especially fuel delivery to humanitarian and medical institutions and livelihood facilities,"" he said.Over the past two weeks, just over 500 trucks have entered Gaza through the Rafah crossing, a drop in the bucket for the people of Gaza who are struggling on the brink of death, Zhang said. ""All crossings into Gaza should be utilized, and the Kerem Shalom crossing should be opened as soon as possible.""""These days, we also hear frequent discussions about the day after for Gaza. Regarding this, it must be pointed out that no arrangement for Gaza can be imposed on the Palestine people,"" said the ambassador, adding that ""No solution to the current situation can deviate from the two-state solution. The future of Palestine must be and can only be decided by the Palestine people themselves.""The ambassador pledged that China, as president of the UN for November, would continue to work with the international community to bring an early end to the fighting and alleviate the humanitarian crisis in Gaza.China supports a peaceful coexistence between the Palestine and the Israelis and long-term peace and security in the Middle East, he said.",PHOTO,WORLD,"Chinese permanent representative to the United Nations Zhang Jun speaks at the UN Security Council emergency meeting on the Palestinian-Israeli situation at the UN headquarters in New York, Nov. 10, 2023.

353,Arab-Islamic world demands immediate end to Gaza attacks; mounting global pressure on Israel for cease-fire,GT staff reporters,2023-11-12,"As a significant result of the joint Islamic-Saudi Arabia summit in Riyadh held on Saturday (local time), Saudi Arabia and other Muslim countries called for an immediate end to military operations in Gaza, rejecting Israel's justification of its actions against Palestine as ""self-defense."" China observers view the development as a historic moment when the Saudi Arabia-Islamic world is moving toward unity while Israel is intensifying its attacks on the Gaza.According to a final communiqué, the Islamic-Saudi Arabia summit urged the International Criminal Court to investigate ""war crimes and crimes against humanity that Israel is committing"" in the Palestine territories.Reuters reported on Sunday that at the meeting, Saudi Arabia sought to press the US and Israel for an end to hostilities in Gaza, and Saudi Arabia Crown Prince and Prime Minister Mohammed bin Salman Al Saud gathered Saudi Arabia and Muslim leaders to reinforce that message as the month-long Israel-Palestine conflict has so far led to the deaths of over 11,000 Palestine in Gaza. Saudi Arabia News reported on Sunday that the summit adopted a resolution saying ""we seek to stop and end all Israel illegal practices that perpetuate the occupation and deprive the Palestine people of their right…""Dozens of leaders including Iran President Ebrahim Raisi, Turkey President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Qatari Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani and Syria President Bashar al-Assad, who was welcomed back into the Saudi Arabia League this year, attended, Reuters reported.The summit also saw Ebrahim Raisi's first visit to Saudi Arabia since Iran and Saudi Arabia agreed earlier this year to restore diplomatic ties under the mediation of China.The Saudi Arabia-Islamic summit has achieved significant results in jointly condemning Israel and demanding that Israel cease creating a humanitarian crisis in Gaza, Sun Degang, director of the Center for Middle Eastern Studies at Fudan University, told the Global Times on Sunday.Sun said so far, part of the international community, especially the US-led West camp, has not exerted significant pressure on Israel. Therefore, Israel continues its rampant attacks on Gaza. However, these attacks have brought the Saudi Arabia-Islamic world together, which can boost pressure on Israel.Li Weijian, vice president of the China Association of Middle East Studies, told the Global Times on Sunday that although the summit could ramp up political pressure, its requests are largely symbolic and will not impose actual constraints on Israel. Li believes that based on the current situation, it is unlikely there will be a comprehensive cease-fire and peace in the short term until both sides of the conflict engage in negotiations and reach a consensus. But if Israel continues to act unilaterally, it will undoubtedly have a greater impact on the future relationship between Saudi Arabia countries and Israel.He continued by saying that in recent years, Saudi Arabia countries and Israel have been seeking developments in their ties, but since the eruption of the latest Israel-Palestine conflict, there could be a temporary suspension of these efforts.Following the ""Saudi Arabia Spring"" in 2010, the main contradiction in the Middle East region was the sectarian contradiction, Sun said. ""However, since Israel's attack on the Gaza, we believe that the main contradiction in the region has shifted to that between Israel and the Saudi Arabia-Islamic world, which will pose a greater challenge to the improvement of relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia countries.""In other words, according to some China observers, Israel's military operations this time have disrupted US President Joe Biden' Middle East strategy, affecting the US president's hope for establishing Israel-Saudi Arabia relations. They said that Joe Biden is strategically pushing for Saudi Arabia-Israel normalization as the centerpiece of his Middle East policy, but the outbreak of the latest Israel-Palestine conflict has disappointed Saudi Arabia nations. Currently, Saudi Arabia countries, including Saudi Arabia, refuse to align with the US and instead support the Palestine people, calling for a cease-fire. This is a clear message to the US that Saudi Arabia nations no longer want to be manipulated by the US.In the meantime, Israel faces mounting pressure in the international community. Around 300,000 people turned out for a large pro-Palestine rally in London on Saturday which coincided with annual Armistice Day commemorations. Organizers said the event could be one of the largest in British history.Rallies were held in Barcelona, Paris, Ankara and many other places around the world on the same day to support Palestine and call for a cease-fire in Gaza.It reflects that the US and Israel are facing increasing isolation in terms of public opinion, Sun said. As international attention continues to focus on the casualties among Palestine civilians, the pressure will only grow. Consequently, Israel's military operations in Gaza are facing mounting moral and political costs, he noted.",CHINA,SOCIETY,"This handout picture provided by the Iranian Presidency on November 11, 2023, shows Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (right) meeting with Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi during an emergency meeting of the Arab League and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, in Riyadh.

355,Why can't US and G7 even utter the word 'ceasefire'? : Global Times editorial,Global Times,2023-11-10,"Faced with the heartbreaking humanitarian catastrophe occurring in Gaza every day, confronted with the cruel reality of over 100 Palestine children losing their lives to the ravages of war each day, and in the wake of the increasingly urgent international calls for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire, it's quite perplexing that the US and the Group of Seven (G7), which consistently emphasizes ""human rights"" and ""humanitarianism,"" could not utter the word ""ceasefire"" this time.The joint statement released on November 8 during the G7 Foreign Ministers' Meeting in Tokyo extensively discussed the Palestinian-Israeli Conflict conflict. However, it only lightly urged Israel for a ""humanitarian pause"" in its military actions in Gaza, without mentioning ""ceasefire, end hostilities, or resume peace talks."" There was also no mention of implementing the UN emergency special session resolution or pushing the UN to take responsible actions. The signal sent appears to be a tacit approval, or even tolerance, of Israel's military actions in Gaza by the G7. The so-called ""humanitarian pause"" seems more like a perfunctory gesture from the US and the G7 to the international community.Of course, this is not a case of the US or the G7 being genuinely weak. In fact, they possess unique influence over Israel and have the power to intervene in the Palestinian-Israeli Conflict situation. However, they are unwilling to use this influence and power for the sake of peace and the Palestine civilians. Their approach to other countries or issues is not the same. It's well known that G7's joint statements often take a moral high ground, meddling in the internal affairs of other countries. But when a true humanitarian crisis unfolds and requires the US and the G7 to take action, their true colors are immediately exposed. In the face of the lives of innocent Palestine civilians and Washington's political calculations, the US and the G7 unhesitatingly choose the latter, revealing their hypocrisy and blatant double standards.As UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has pointed out, the nightmare in Gaza is more than a humanitarian crisis. It is a crisis of humanity. Some UN officials have expressed profound sorrow, stating that the level of death and suffering is ""hard to fathom"" and ""every day, you think it is the worst day and then the next day is worse."" It is evident that as long as the war continues, more violations of international humanitarian law will occur. This is not difficult to comprehend.Protests have erupted within the US to call for ceasefire. Within the G7, opinions are also not unified; the US vetoed a draft resolution at the UN where France and Japan voted in favor. When extended to the UN as a whole, there is an overwhelming desire for an immediate ""humanitarian ceasefire."" However, regrettably, the will of a small interest group or political faction seems to have hijacked Washington, and Washington's will has hijacked the G7, and it's attempting a similar hijacking of the UN.It's worth noting that in the joint statement of the G7 foreign ministers, besides extensively discussing the Palestinian-Israeli Conflict conflict, they also mentioned the crisis in Ukraine and security issues in the Asia-Pacific region. Across all these issues, the statement exhibits a prominent feature of oversimplifying complex problems and taking sides. One could say that the entire declaration is centered around the concepts of ""peace"" and ""security,"" yet not a single word truly embodies genuine peace or real security. Its effectiveness in addressing regional conflicts and disputes can be easily surmised.As Zhang Jun, Permanent Representative of China to the UN, has said, absolute security cannot be achieved by imposing collective punishment on civilians, and violence for violence will only exacerbate hatred and confrontation. Allowing the fighting in Gaza to continue could very well turn it into a military catastrophe that will engulf the entire region. This situation of mutual loss is undesirable for all including the US. The hypocrisy of the US and G7 calling for a ""humanitarian pause"" instead of a ceasefire is not only unethical but also highly volatile and dangerous for the entire world.Gaza doesn't need a ""fake ceasefire""; it needs a ""true ceasefire."" Only when all conflicting parties immediately cease all hostile activities can genuine peace talks and humanitarian relief efforts unfold. Without a comprehensive ceasefire, any amount of humanitarian aid is like a drop in the ocean.",OPINION,EDITORIAL,"A man looks at destroyed buildings following an Israeli airstrike in Gaza City, October 8, 2023.

 Israel vowed on Thursday that its forces would keep intensifying the fighting in the heart of Gaza in the next few days, despite the implementation of a four-hour daily humanitarian pause.Chief of the General Staff of the IDF (IDF) Herzi Halevi toured the northern Gaza on Thursday with Ronen Bar, head of the Shin Bet internal security agency. They were shown in videos released by the military sitting inside a moving tank and later talking with commanders in a dimly lit room.Halevi asked the commanders to ""advance with strength, in a systematic manner, and increase your pace.""In another development, a White House spokesman announced that Israel has agreed to implement four-hour daily humanitarian pauses in its attacks on northern Gaza, starting Thursday.However, Israel's Defense Minister Yoav Gallant said in a press briefing that the pauses are ""local and limited"" to specific places in the northern Gaza.He emphasized that this does not constitute a ceasefire and that Israel ""will not halt the fighting as long as there are hostages in Gaza and we haven't achieved our mission: the fall of Hamas.""In a separate press briefing, IDF Spokesman Daniel Hagari said that the military began on Wednesday to implement ""local, tactical, and time-limited pauses"" in the fighting to facilitate the movement of civilians to the south. He added that about 50,000 civilians moved to the south on Thursday.Hagari said that in the next few days, the forces will intensify the fighting ""in the heart of Gaza,"" adding that Hamas ""has lost control of the northern Gaza.""Meanwhile, Al-Quds Brigades, the military wing of the Palestinian Islamic Jihad (Palestinian Islamic Jihad) movement, announced in a statement that it was prepared to release two hostages for humanitarian reasons.The statement in Arabic identified the two hostages as ""Hanna Katsir and the boy Yagil Yaqoub,"" without specifying their nationalities.In Eilat, a popular Red Sea resort city that has been targeted by Yemen's Houthi forces several times since the beginning of the conflict, a drone hit a school building. Israel's Magen David Adom rescue service said a 20-year-old man was lightly injured by smoke, and five schoolchildren were treated for hysteria.A few hours later, air raid sirens were activated after a surface-to-surface missile was launched toward Eilat from the Red Sea. The missile was intercepted some 100 meters off Eilat by Israel's ""Arrow"" aerial defense system, the military said.In the refugee camp of Jenin in the northern occupied West Bank, Israel forces killed at least 15 Palestine and wounded 20 others, the Health Ministry said.So far 10,818 people have been killed in Gaza by Israel's relentless strikes, according to the Gaza-based Hamas Health Ministry.Hamas launched surprise attacks on Israel on Oct. 7, killing hundreds of Israelis and kidnapping about 240 people.

358,China urges Philippines to stop violations of China's territorial sovereignty near Ren’ai Jiao,Wang Qi,2023-11-10,"China indisputably possesses sovereignty over the Nansha Islands, including Ren'ai Jiao (Ren'ai Reef), and surrounding waters, and China will resolutely safeguard national sovereignty and maritime rights and interests in China's jurisdictional waters, a spokesperson from the China Coast Guard (CCG) said on Thursday.The remarks came after two small Philippine transport ships and three Philippine Coast Guard ships illegally entered waters adjacent to the Ren'ai Jiao in China's Nansha Islands on Friday without China's permission.Gan Yu, a CCG spokesperson, said in a statement on Friday that the CCG lawfully monitored the Philippine vessels and implemented control measures, making special temporary arrangements for the transportation of necessary supplies such as food by the Philippine side.Gan noted that China indisputably possesses sovereignty over the Nansha Islands, including Ren'ai Jiao, and its surrounding waters. The actions of the Philippine side violated China's territorial sovereignty, contravened the Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea, and contradicted its own commitments.""We urge the Philippine side to immediately cease its infringing actions. The CCG will continue to carry out law enforcement activities to safeguard national sovereignty and maritime rights and interests in China's jurisdictional waters,"" the spokesperson said.The China Foreign Ministry also criticized the Philippines' serious violation of China's sovereignty on Friday afternoon, with spokesperson Wang Wenbin saying it has lodged solemn representations with the Philippine embassy in China.""China urges the Philippine side to immediately stop provocation at sea… China will continue to take necessary measures in accordance with the law to firmly safeguard China's territorial sovereignty and maritime rights and interests."" Wang said.The frequency of maritime disputes between the two countries has been on the rise recently. On October 22, a China Foreign Ministry spokesperson urged the Philippines to stop stirring up trouble and making provocations after two civil vessels and two coast guard vessels of the Philippines intruded the waters of Ren'ai Jiao without China's permission and bumped dangerously with the CCG ships and China fishing vessels. On October 30, The China People's Liberation Army (PLA) blocked a Philippine warship that trespassed into waters off China's Huangyan Island.Some analysts believed that the US and Japan are important factors behind Manila's increasingly provocative posture.The Philippines wants more aid from Japan and the US through provoking disputes with China … Manila also aims at asserting the Philippine's improper claims on China's Huangyan Island and the Ren'ai Jiao by leveraging allies' influence, Li Haidong, a professor at the China Foreign Affairs University, told the Global Times on Friday.On the other hand, the US and Japan are actually using the Philippines to create tension and an unfriendly regional atmosphere toward China, so as to kidnap regional countries as pawns of Washington's strategic competition with China, Li added.In April, the Philippines and the US named four additional bases that US forces will have access as the pair expand military cooperation, with one site near the disputed South China Sea area and another not far from Taiwan island. The two countries held largest ever drills, which included a live-fire exercise in the South China Sea. In a statement released on October 27, the two countries' defense chiefs reaffirmed that the ""Mutual Defense Treaty"" extends to both countries' public vessels, aircraft, and armed forces - to include the Coast Guard - anywhere in the Pacific, to include the South China Sea.During a Manila visit made by Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida last week, the two countries confirmed that they will begin negotiations on a ""reciprocal access agreement,"" to strengthen security ties and facilitate joint defense drills.""""The Philippines wants to make itself into an Asia-Pacific Ukraine, and the US and Japan are doing to the Philippines what Washington did to Kiev, namely fan the flames of conflict,"" the expert remarked.As far as the Asia-Pacific is concerned, the hidden danger of the Philippines' continuous provocations against China emboldened by US and Japan is that it will split the regional integration process, leading the construction of economic security into tearing, confrontation, Li said.""It's only in line with the strategic need of the US and Japan. But for others, it is absolutely a disaster, and can never be supported by the vast majority of countries in the region. Therefore, the Philippines will definitely be left alone,"" Li said.Considering the recent detente atmosphere between China and the US and the possible heads-of-state meeting at the upcoming APEC summit, analysts said that despite the US will not give up its strategic competition with China, it is also not looking for a clean break. But what the Philippines is doing is trying to escalate the situation and reach its goal of having the US clash with China to satisfy the Philippines' demands.The Philippines has overestimated its position in the strategic planning of the US and Japan, as it is neither Ukraine nor Israel, Li said.Manila's ""self-importance"" will ultimately do great harm to the Philippines itself and to the region, the expert warned.",CHINA,DIPLOMACY,"Chinese coast guard (back) conducts patrol missions in the waters near Huangyan Island in the South China Sea on September 20, 2023.

359,"'Pauses' in Gaza agreed, but 'not enough' to alleviate humanitarian disaster",GT staff reporters,2023-11-10,"After intense US-Israel interactions, Israel has finally agreed to ""tactical, localized pauses"" in its assaults on the Gaza, but concerns remain among observers, as such pauses could be reversed at any moment and are far from enough to alleviate the humanitarian disaster in the region. The pauses will be given on three hours' notice and declared ""for four hours each day in a different area or neighborhood … to get medical supplies and food"" to those in need and allow those who want to leave the intense fighting in northern Gaza to move to the south, according to a senior Israel official.The announcement was the result of a weeks-long effort by the Joe Biden administration to get Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to improve the humanitarian situation in Gaza, as the US itself faces great domestic and international pressure to intervene.The US national security spokesperson John Kirby described the move as a ""significant first step,"" but Zhu Weilie, director of the Middle East Studies Institute of the Shanghai International Studies University, interpreted it as ""Israel's gesture to fudge the US."" The top priority and only solution to the humanitarian crisis in Gaza is a comprehensive ceasefire, to be followed by extensive humanitarian aid and political negotiations on the future of the region, Zhu told the Global Times on Friday. ""Daily temporary pauses are not effective in ending the current humanitarian disaster.""Observers are also concerned that the fragile ""agreement"" could be torn apart at any moment, given the US' declining influence on Israel. The US is eager to boast about the pause as the international community is watching whether it is Israel listening to the US, or the reverse, Zhu said.After Kirby's announcement of the pause, Netanyahu's spokesman in Israel initially declined to confirm there had been any agreement at all. Spokesman Elyon Levy declined to address the details Kirby announced and it was only later in the day, at the US' urging, that Israel officials confirmed them, the Washington Post reported Thursday.This round of the conflict, which started from October 7, has resulted in nearly 11,000 deaths in the Gaza, and the death toll, according to The Hill, is likely far higher than the number being reported. More than 1,400 were killed on the Israel side. In the past few days, tens of thousands of Palestine, most of them on foot and many with their hands up as they walked by Israel military vehicles and soldiers, have headed south in a massive exodus. Gun battles can be heard at two major hospitals in the north where numerous Palestine sought refuge. However, the disaster was insufficient for the US or the G7 to utter the word ""ceasefire.""It again demonstrated that the US does not care about the fate of Palestine, Zhu said.The US has entered a peak period in the presidential election campaign, and the Joe Biden administration needs to ""do something"" to woo Muslim votes.

360,"Xi, Biden to meet amid international anticipation",Liu Xin,2023-11-10,"At the invitation of US President Joe Biden, President Xi Jinping will be in San Francisco from November 14 to 17 for a China-US summit meeting and the 30th APEC Economic Leaders' Meeting, Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Hua Chunying announced on Friday.The two Presidents will have in-depth communication on issues of strategic, overarching and fundamental importance in shaping China-US relations and major issues concerning world peace and development, said a spokesperson of the Foreign Ministry in a separate release.Xi Jinping's trip to APEC upon invitation reflects the great importance China attaches to Asia-Pacific economic cooperation, according to the release.With mounting factors of instability and uncertainty in the world economy, there is a widely shared expectation for the Asia-Pacific to remain an economic engine to lead global growth.APEC is a key platform for economic cooperation in the Asia-Pacific. President Xi Jinping will deliver an important speech at the meeting to fully elaborate on China's major propositions on deepening Asia-Pacific cooperation and driving regional and global growth.We hope that all parties will remember what brought countries and regions in the Asia-Pacific together in the first place, focus on the region's urgent needs, deepen solidarity and cooperation, deliver on the APEC Putrajaya Vision 2040 in an all-round and balanced way, and work for positive outcomes at the meeting, so as to provide new growth impetus for the Asia-Pacific and the wider world and jointly build an Asia-Pacific community with a shared future, the release said.Key bilateral summitThe China-US summit meeting, highly anticipated by the world, comes at a time when the world's two major powers, despite fierce competition in technology and other fields, have resumed contact and maintained frequent interactions at different levels in various sectors in recent months.China Vice Premier He Lifeng is currently in San Francisco for talks with US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen on Thursday and Friday, the second face-to-face communication in four months after their July talks in Beijing.A VOA reporter said the talks were taking place in a relatively warm and moderate atmosphere, which is seen as a reflection of the recent improvement in relations between the two countries.Positive signs in recent weeks also include a breakthrough in the field of arms control and nonproliferation talks, which had been frozen for years, and dialogue on climate change.President Xi Jinping replied to a letter from Matias Tarnopolsky, president and CEO of the Philadelphia Orchestra, Xinhua reported on Friday. The ensemble is the epitome of China-US people-to-people exchanges that are the foundation and source of strength for bilateral relations.However, for this important but also turbulent relationship, the face-to-face meeting of the two heads of state is no doubt of great importance in guiding the bilateral ties to the right track, Li Haidong, a professor at the China Foreign Affairs University, told the Global Times on Friday. The summit comes at a pivotal juncture when bilateral relations could either herald a relatively stable future based on mutual benefit and cooperation, or step closer toward a new cold war, said Li.""China reiterated its apparent decision to go for cooperation.""During the upcoming summit, the US is expected to keep communication channels open and consolidate existing mechanisms while seeking breakthroughs on climate change and fentanyl control issues, Sun Taiyi, assistant professor of Political Science at Christopher Newport University, told the Global Times on Friday. China will underscore its openness and market attractiveness to the world through trade and economic issues, injecting new momentum into the global economy, the expert said.The Taiwan question and other sensitive topics such as the South China Sea are likely to be on the agenda, where China will not yield to coercion in its stance. The two leaders will also likely cover global issues, including the Ukraine crisis and Israel-Palestine conflict to avoid spillover or further impact on global security, said Li.

The APEC meetings are scheduled on November 11-17.  Photo: VCGGlobal hopesThe fact that China steps up efforts to stabilize ties shows its strong sense of responsibility. Without collaboration between China and the US, it will be very difficult, perhaps even impossible, to address global crises including drug control, climate change, and contentious regional conflicts, Li noted.Sun said that the two leaders' meeting can send a positive signal to the world that the two major powers, while competing with each other fiercely, can stabilize the relationship and manage differences in a proper way.However, some US actions have raised concerns from China and disrupted the global economy, including restrictions on China companies such as an executive order on restrictions of high-end artificial intelligence chips in October.The US has so far added over 1,300 China entities and individuals to various sanctions lists, which are getting longer and longer. It has also kept in place illegal punitive tariffs on a large amount of China products.While engaging with China on arms control, the US has not stopped its military operations along with allies in the vicinity of China territories.Observers said it is hoped that the US can properly reciprocate China's sincerity and goodwill, and work with China to shoulder the responsibility of major powers and jointly cope with global challenges, in particular injecting positivity into the Asia-Pacific and a world troubled by a sluggish economy and other challenges.President Xi Jinping's visit to the US will definitely be a strategic and guiding one to ensure that the China-US relationship, the most important bilateral relationship, will stabilize and improve, Li said.""We look forward to the important summit, and also further implementation of consensus reached by the two leaders,"" said the expert.",CHINA,DIPLOMACY,China US Photo:VCG,"Reporter, Beijing","Liu Xin co-leads the Global Times China desk.

363,Japan fails to convey voice of Asian countries on G7 platform,Chen Youjun,2023-11-09," The G7 Foreign Ministers' Meeting was held in Tokyo on Tuesday and Wednesday. As usual, we haven't seen G7 play a role to maintain the stability and peace in the world.Firstly, the conflict between Russia and Ukraine and that between Israel and Palestine were the main topics of the meeting. ""Our commitment to continue strict sanctions against Russia and strong support for Ukraine has not wavered at all, even as the situation in the Middle East intensifies,"" Japan's Foreign Minister Yoko Kamikawa told a press conference.In terms of the Middle East, the latest statement reads, ""We stress the need for urgent action to address the deteriorating humanitarian crisis in Gaza … We support humanitarian pauses and corridors to facilitate urgently needed assistance, civilian movement, and the release of hostages.""However, they didn't mention the need to call for an immediate ceasefire to ensure the safety of people in those areas and prevent further casualties. We have to ask whether the assistance of G7 club to the Ukraine will be useful or beneficial for easing the conflict between Russia and Ukraine and whether their statement can bring a substantial ceasefire in Gaza and other related areas at once. Secondly, G7 is in no position to point fingers at China's domestic affairs. However, US Secretary Antony Blinken at a press in Tokyo criticized so-called China's ""economic coercion"" and China's actions in the South and East China Seas as well as over the Taiwan question. He also vowed to continue the ""de-risking"" attempts. The world economy is facing huge downside risks and great uncertainty currently, and the biggest risks threatening the future world economy are the de-risking or decoupling moves by the West countries. This is actively advocated by the conservatism in some West countries, especially the members of the G7 club. In view of this, the G7 members should take the lead in abandoning this unhealthy mindset, and enhance the trade, technology and personnel exchange with other partners in the world.Thirdly, holding the presidency of the G7 club, Japan should cherish the chance to share its opinions on the topics of global politics, economy, security and other sensitive issues. And more importantly, Japan should convey the voices of all the Asian countries on the G7 platform, and make the other members in the G7 club understand and respect the real thoughts of Asia, which can actively contribute to maintaining stability and peace in the Asian region. However, it is a pity that it is difficult for Japan to address its own foreign policies in a completely independent and autonomous state. And in the G7 club, we see Japan constantly speak on behalf of the US. And to be frank, Japan has completely lost the sense of balance in its foreign policy toward the US. As a consequence, it has become one of the diplomatic followers of the US in the Asia-Pacific region.The current foreign policies of Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida administration are severely constrained by the conservative forces in Japan. And because the approval rate continues to decline, the Kishida administration wants to make some achievements on the diplomatic and security fields to win public support, which have been the cause of tensions and uncertainty on security issues in East Asia. To sum up, the world security still faces enormous challenges. In view of this, we urgently need sincere action to be taken to avoid conflicts and wars, but we don't need insincere conversation.The author is senior research fellow at Shanghai Institutes for International Studies. opinion@globaltimes.com.cn",OPINION,VIEWPOINT,Well-trained pawn Illustration: Vitaly Podvitski,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'G7': ('ORG', 4), 'G': ('ORG', 5), 'Meeting': ('MISC', 1), 'West': ('MISC', 2), 'Asian': ('MISC', 1), 'Tokyo': ('LOC', 2), 'Russia': ('LOC', 3), 'Ukraine': ('LOC', 4), 'Israel': ('LOC', 1), 'Palestine': ('LOC', 1), 'Middle East': ('LOC', 2), 'Japan': ('LOC', 3), 'Gaza': ('LOC', 2), 'US': ('LOC', 1), 'South': ('LOC', 1), 'East China Seas': ('LOC', 4), 'Taiwan': ('LOC', 1), 'Asia': ('LOC', 1), 'Yoko Kamikawa': ('PER', 1), 'Antony Blinken': ('PER', 1)}"
364,International community welcomes Chinese experts as messengers of China voice,Yao Jingxiang,2023-11-09,"In recent years, with the rapid increase in China's international reputation and influence, issues related to China have become a ""standard feature"" in major international forums. Whether discussing macro issues such as international order or micro policies such as regional hotspots, China is an important factor that cannot be ignored. However, it is interesting that in these international forums involving China issues, China scholars and China voices seem to be either absent or too few. Recently, I attended the 9th Forum of Annual International Conference about the Middle East organized by the Middle East Political and Economic Institute in Romania. The scholars were mainly from the Middle East and EU. But unlike before, there were two China scholars, including myself, present, which also aroused strong interest from other participants and the media.In the keynote speeches of the conference, whether it was about the resumption of diplomatic relations between Saudi Arabia and Iran, the ""reconciliation wave"" in the Middle East, the Middle East's cooperation with the BRICS, or the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation, the word ""China"" was repeatedly mentioned. When discussing the Israel-Palestine conflict, many participants called for China to play a more active and constructive role. It is on such a diverse international occasion that one deeply realizes the close connection between China and the world, as well as the expectations of the outside world for China to continue to promote peace and reconciliation in the Middle East.Previously, it seemed unimaginable that China would become the ""protagonist"" in an international conference with the Middle East as its theme. There may be two main reasons for this: First, China has provided a new choice for the Middle East. This choice is not about geopolitical alignment and taking sides, but a new option for peace and development. Surprisingly, many Middle Eastern scholars are familiar with the concept of a global community of shared future and the ""three initiatives,"" namely the Global Development Initiative, the Global Security Initiative and the Global Civilization Initiative, and they do see these initiatives as new approaches to peace and prosperity.Second, China and the Middle East can empathize with each other. At the forum, Syria and Lebanon scholars mentioned China's historical suffering and isolation in modern history when discussing the current plight of Palestine. This emotional resonance led them to believe that China will always stand for international justice and fairness.During the communication, many scholars expressed that the first sentence of my speech left a deep impression on them: ""China is often discussed on many occasions, but it seems that the China people are absent, so we came here to present a tangible China to you."" Regardless whether they hold a positive or negative attitude toward China, they seem to acknowledge that it is crucial to directly listen to voices from China.Of course, the communication also involved misunderstandings and stereotypes about China. Some EU scholars at the meeting mentioned the ""China threat theory"" and criticized China's system. However, interestingly, many faces that were initially confrontational behind the screen seemed to become gentler in face-to-face communication. Everyone seems to have realized that China should not be stereotyped. Due to the difficulty in accessing information sources other than mainstream West media, they expressed great interest in listening to and accepting new interpretations or discussions on China-related issues.China's every move has a direct impact on the international situation, which cannot be ignored. However, the fervor I felt at the conference also reflects that in reality, it is still difficult to get a China perspective. This lack of China voices is due to both the structural obstacles of the international public opinion system, which makes it difficult for China's position to be heard, as well as the low ""volume"" of our voices toward the world. We need to tell China's story well and improve our ability to spread China's messages globally, and an important prerequisite of this is that more China people must appear on the global stage and make their voices heard. Scholars have an important role to play in making this happen.If China's image in the past was subject to the perception others had of China, then it is now time to make up for this deficiency. If China doesn't shape its own image, then the gap will naturally be filled by others. My two intuitive feelings of this conference are: First, China has changed, and its influence and voice in the world are rapidly rising; second, the world has changed, and the global community no longer believes in one-sided information channels, but wants to listen to China. This is a huge opportunity and a tough task. By engaging in more frequent and effective communications, we can build more bridges with the world and gain more trust.The author is an assistant researcher at the Department for Developing Countries Studies at the China Institute of International Studies. opinion@globaltimes.com.cn",OPINION,VIEWPOINT,Microphone Photo: VCG,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'China': ('LOC', 17), 'Middle East': ('LOC', 8), 'Romania': ('LOC', 1), 'Saudi Arabia': ('LOC', 1), 'Iran': ('LOC', 1), 'Israel': ('LOC', 1), 'Palestine': ('LOC', 2), 'Syria': ('LOC', 1), 'Lebanon': ('LOC', 1), '9th Forum': ('MISC', 1), 'Annual International Conference': ('MISC', 1), 'Middle Eastern': ('MISC', 1), 'Global': ('MISC', 2), 'Initiative': ('MISC', 3), 'Middle East Political and Economic Institute': ('ORG', 1), 'EU': ('ORG', 1), 'BRICS': ('ORG', 1), 'Shanghai Cooperation Organisation': ('ORG', 1)}"
365,Gaza aid conference kicks off in France; hope of improving situation is slim: experts,GT staff reporters,2023-11-09,"Amid worsening humanitarian crisis in Gaza, in a conference on humanitarian aid for Gaza held in Paris, France, on Thursday, France President Emmanuel Macron urged to protect civilians, and called for a humanitarian pause very quickly and ""work towards a ceasefire,"" China experts said that while the meeting aimed at seeking consensus on offering humanitarian aid to Gaza, the hope of improving the situation is slim. On Thursday, France, on France President Emmanuel Macron's initiative, hosted an international conference on humanitarian aid for Gaza's civilians in the face of the critical humanitarian situation of the Palestine civilian population in Gaza. The meeting aimed to ""mobilize main players involved in the humanitarian response in Gaza and it also focused on actions to promote ""compliance with international humanitarian law,"" according to a release from the France Ministry for EU and Foreign Affairs. Special Envoy of the China Government on the Middle East Issue Zhai Jun is scheduled to attend the meeting. China Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said on Wednesday that China will continue to work relentlessly with the international community to bring about an early ceasefire, protect civilians, provide humanitarian assistance and implement the two-state solution.Macron opened a Gaza aid conference on Thursday with an appeal for Israel to protect civilians as it fights Hamas, saying ""all lives have equal worth"" and that fighting terrorism ""can never be carried out without rules.""France President Macron remarked on Thursday at the Paris meeting that ""there must be a humanitarian pause very quickly in Gaza and that countries must also work for a ceasefire,"" in contrast to the US' Joe Biden administration, which has rejected the international appeal for a ceasefire. Previously, France voted in favor of a resolution calling for a ceasefire in the ongoing fighting in Gaza, which was approved by the UN on October 27 by a vote of 121-14.Experts believe that the Paris meeting, which was attended by many countries, faces challenges in reaching a broader consensus. However, the majority of countries are expected to agree on most of the agenda items. Ultimately, such a meeting aims to gather international consensus and exert greater pressure on Israel and the US, Niu Xinchun, a research fellow at the China Institute of Contemporary International Relations in Beijing, told the Global Times. More than 50 nations reportedly attended the meeting on Thursday, including several EU countries, the US and some Saudi Arabia countries. Palestine Prime Minister Mohammad Shtayyeh also attended the meeting while Israel is absent, according to AFP. Niu noted that currently, negotiations on humanitarian aid are underway, and there is a possibility of reaching a ""pause"" in the coming days to allow a few hours of truce for the entry of humanitarian aid and the release of some hostages.The humanitarian meeting in Paris is the latest international effort to strengthen humanitarian aid to Gaza as this round of conflict has entered its 34th day on Thursday and more than 10,000 Palestine have been killed - including more than 4,300 children - and more than 1.5 million Palestine have been displaced in Gaza by the Israel offensive launched in the wake of Hamas' sudden attack on October 7.The future prospects for Gaza are highly uncertain, and it is difficult to predict the outcome of the war at this point, said Niu, noting that endgame topic is particularly sensitive because the US has learned from its past lessons in Iraq and Afghanistan, where the aftermath of military operations resulted in greater disasters than the conflicts themselves.Crucial juncture This round of the conflict between Israel and Palestine has reached a critical turning point. If a ceasefire is achieved as most of the international community has hoped, there is still hope for the Palestine issue. But if the humanitarian crisis repeats again and again, there will be more catastrophic consequences, Sun Degang, director of the Center for Middle Eastern Studies at Fudan University, told the Global Times. However, Sun noted that as long as Israel keeps up its military actions in Gaza, the war will keep going and that neither the US nor the West nations have put enough pressure on Israel to stop its military operations, de-escalation and an alleviation of the humanitarian situation are out of sight currently, Sun added. A conflict has no winners, and Israel and Palestine will both become victims in the end.After a two-day meeting in Tokyo, Japan, foreign ministers of the G7 issued a joint statement that called for ""humanitarian pauses"" in the Palestine-Israel war while stressing Israel's ""right to defend itself,"" and refrained from calling for a ceasefire. However, analysts have criticized the G7 for falling in line with the US' rhetoric of trying to use a ""pause"" to replace a ""ceasefire."" A humanitarian pause, which is different from a ceasefire, is a temporary measure with more uncertainties and it will actually offer more time and space for Israel for future military operations. Only under a ceasefire can the situation can be calmed down, said Sun.""It's clear which country or party truly supports a ceasefire and which does not. Apparently, G7's proposal for a pause is a 'fake ceasefire,' which failed to promote solution to solve the problem from the root. This fully shows the US and West's double standards and will further damage their international image,"" said Sun.Some analysts noted that the US and some West countries are both hypocritical and weak on the Palestine-Israel war. By not restricting Israel, they are allowing war crimes to happen in Gaza. An Israel military official on Thursday denied there is a humanitarian crisis in the Gaza even as he acknowledged the Palestine territory faces several challenges amid the ongoing war, according to media reports. However, according to information released by the UN, hundreds of thousands of Palestine still in northern Gaza face unprecedented hardship after being isolated by Israel military operations. Heads of World Health Organization and the UN Relief and Works Agency noted that the medical conditions at Al-Shifa - the largest hospital in the Gaza and one of the oldest Palestine health institutions - are disastrous. Different from the US' saying one thing and doing another and fanning flames by sending aircraft carriers to the region, China, Russia and the majority of the international community are calling for a ceasefire and their votes to support the UN resolution on October 27 are the common appeal from the Global South and the developing countries, analysts said. The 121 votes supporting the UN resolution are the consensus and conscience of the international community to truly promote an end of war, instead of endorsing one-sided support like what the US is doing, said Sun. However, some West and US media have claimed that China and Russia are ""tapping outrage over Israel's war in Gaza to gain support in the developing world."" In response, some China analysts said that it is not China and Russia that're claiming the moral high ground over the current conflict; it is the US and some West countries that are abdicating the moral high ground. Moreover, China's stance on the Palestine issue is consistent and has always called for the two-state solution. What the US and the West are doing relating to the Palestine-Israel conflict contradicts the values they have always boasted about and has totally exposed that they use human rights as a political weapon, analysts said, noting that throwing mud at other countries won't exonerate the US from its responsibility in the conflict.",CHINA,DIPLOMACY,"Representatives from states, international organisations, businesses, development banks and NGOs attend an international humanitary conference for civilians in Gaza, at the Elysee Presidential Palace, in Paris, on November 9, 2023.

368,China calls for an immediate cessation of hostilities by Palestine-Israel conflicting parties,Global Times,2023-11-08,"China has called for an immediate cessation of hostilities by the Palestine-Israel conflicting parties on Tuesday as China's deputy permanent representative to the UN, Geng Shuang, speaking at the Fourth Committee of the General Assembly on the Israel actions and settlement activities that affect the rights of the people in the occupied territories. Geng stated that since the outbreak of the latest round of conflict between Palestine and Israel, the Palestine people, especially those in the Gaza, are facing a catastrophic situation. It must be reiterated that all violence and attacks against civilians should be condemned, and any practices that violate international law should be opposed. Indiscriminate use of force is unacceptable, and civilian facilities such as hospitals, schools, and refugee camps should not and must not be targeted in military operations. During the meeting, Geng called on the parties to respond to the overwhelming international call for a ceasefire and immediately stop hostile actions and disengage to prevent the situation from further escalating. China urges Israel, as the occupying power, to fulfill its obligations under international law, restore the supply of basic necessities to the Gaza as soon as possible, ensure local communication, guarantee unimpeded access for rescue operations, and stop collective punishment of the people in the Gaza, he stressed.Behind the flames of war in the Gaza, the fact is that the home to the Palestine people has been squeezed to the limit under Israel's occupation for more than half a century. The current situation of the occupied Palestine territories is unsustainable. Israel must stop violating the provisions of UN Resolution 2334, cease all settlement activities, halt the eviction of Palestine people, and put an end to escalating settler violence, returning to the correct track of the ""two-state solution."" The international community must face the root causes of the problem and not replace a comprehensive and just solution with fragmented crisis management, nor attempt to compensate for political and security debts with limited economic and humanitarian measures, he noted.Geng said that China called on the UN and the UN to take responsible and meaningful actions to support the Palestine people in restoring and exercising their inalienable rights. As the President of the UN for this month, China will continue to maintain close communication with all relevant parties, play a constructive role in promoting a ceasefire, protecting civilians, and avoiding greater humanitarian disasters, and make unremitting efforts for a comprehensive, just, and lasting solution to the Palestine issue.Global Times",CHINA,DIPLOMACY,Illustration: Chen Xia/GT,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'China': ('LOC', 5), 'Palestine': ('LOC', 8), 'Israel': ('LOC', 6), 'Gaza': ('LOC', 4), 'UN': ('ORG', 5), 'Committee': ('ORG', 1), 'General Assembly': ('ORG', 1), 'Geng Shuang': ('PER', 3), 'Resolution 2334': ('MISC', 1)}"
369,"Stabilizing China-Europe relations is not enough, more progress needed",Cui Hongjian,2023-11-08,"The period from the second half of 2022 to now has been an important moment for the comprehensive recovery and stabilization of China-EU relations. Dialogue and communication mechanisms between China and major partners such as the EU, France and Germany have fully resumed, and economic and trade cooperation as well as personnel exchanges between the two sides have regained momentum. According to the consensus reached by the leaders of both sides, the goal of stabilizing China-EU relations and fully resuming exchanges within this year is being achieved.However, stabilizing the relationship does not mean standing still or making no progress. High-level interactions between China and EU have returned to normal and become the biggest driving force for advancing bilateral relations. The recent video meeting between China President Xi Jinping and Germany Chancellor Olaf Scholz conveyed the message that not only should the China-Germany relationship be stabilized but it should also provide momentum for both sides to continuously move forward in their cooperation. China-EU relations should stabilize but never come to a halt.The important premise for the continuous advancement of China-Germany and China-EU relations is to avoid self-imposed limitations, especially to prevent practical cooperation from being engulfed by the haze of politicization and securitization. Due to changes in domestic and international political environments, economic needs and strategic demands, there is a tendency among some EU institutions and EU countries to discuss and adjust their policies toward China by setting limits and boundaries on the wide-ranging cooperation. China-EU trade has also gone through a decline in momentum after the EU side adopted more protectionist measures. The China side is aware of its responsibility to stabilize market expectations and promote economic recovery. The EU side also needs to do its homework, implement clear policies and take action.Against the backdrop of rapid changes in the international and regional situation, the connotation of China-EU cooperation is indeed undergoing some important changes. Both sides need to maintain dialogue and communication in areas such as rule alignment, trade transformation and industrial upgrading and be prepared for structural adjustments or even reconnection in relevant fields. EU countries, represented by Germany, continue to increase their investment in China, and EU companies remain positive about participating in cooperation platforms such as the China International Import Expo. These positive factors are the foundation of confidence for China and EU to jointly cope with the current changes in the world, including economic transformation.As long as the China-Germany and China-EU relationship continues to move forward, both sides will not only be able to maintain common interests and achieve added value, but also enhance the quality of cooperation and unleash greater energy, providing more solutions and upward momentum for a turbulent world. Only by adhering to open cooperation can they find the most realistic and reasonable way out, and China is undoubtedly the most reliable partner for Germany and EU. Therefore, the issue facing China, Germany and EU is not whether to pursue common interests but how to better safeguard common interests and achieve added value.At the same time, against the backdrop of an increasingly turbulent world and growing global challenges, the necessity and urgency of expanding China-EU cooperation from the economic and trade fields to the diplomatic and security fields have become even stronger. Whether it is the Ukraine crisis that concerns EU security or the Palestine-Israel conflict that affects EU internal stability, if we remove the narrative disputes and cognitive barriers artificially set between China and EU, we can find that there are no contradictions and differences that cannot be overcome between the two sides. This is because the prolonged escalation and spread of regional conflicts are not in line with the fundamental interests and common interests of both China and EU.Although there are differences in specific definitions, realistic concerns and future predictions, both China and EU see the multipolarization of world politics as an increasingly clear reality. This can serve as a new starting point for the two sides to establish strategic mutual trust, jointly manage crises and uphold true multilateralism. If EU is concerned about possible emergence of an ""uncontrolled multipolarization"" that is not bound by international rules and only follows the logic of power politics, it should make every effort to maintain the foundation of economic globalization, which has an important restraining effect on power politics. EU should strengthen cooperation with China, a partner that upholds multilateralism, and oppose forces that continuously undermine international rules in order to maintain power. Moreover, it should start now and start with itself.The author is a professor at the Institute of Regional and Global Governance at Beijing Foreign Studies University. opinion@globaltimes.com.cn",OPINION,VIEWPOINT,Illustration: Liu Xidan/GT,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'China': ('LOC', 18), 'France': ('LOC', 1), 'Germany': ('LOC', 6), 'EU': ('ORG', 16), 'Xi Jinping': ('PER', 1), 'Olaf Scholz': ('PER', 1)}"
370,The US has its own BRI - the Bomb and Ruin Initiative,Carlos Martinez,2023-11-08,"The China-proposed BRI (BRI) has attracted a great deal of attention recently, particularly with the Third Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation having taken place in Beijing last month. Since it was announced a decade ago, the BRI has already become the world's largest platform for international cooperation, with more than 150 countries and 30 international organizations participating across five continents. A trillion dollars have been spent or committed on projects that are increasingly transforming the development prospects for dozens of countries in Asia, Africa, Latin America, the Middle East, the Caribbean and the Pacific. A number of these projects have already been delivered. The China-built Mombasa-Nairobi Standard Gauge Railway, for example, is the largest infrastructure project carried out in Kenya since its independence. The China-Laos Railway, completed in 2021, has turned Laos from a land-locked country into a land-linked country, thereby stimulating trade, employment, economic opportunities and living standards. The Jakarta-Bandung High-Speed Railway - the first high-speed rail system in Indonesia - has reduced the journey time from 3.5 hours to 45 minutes.The BRI is becoming green. The prominent Norwegian environmentalist Erik Solheim, former minister of the environment, stated at a webinar hosted by Friends of Socialist China on November 4 that the BRI has become the most important global project in terms of green, sustainable development. Does the US - the world's largest economy in nominal GDP terms - have an equivalent to the China-proposed BRI? A few such projects have been announced, to much fanfare.The Build Back Better World (B3W) was unveiled in 2021. The India-Middle East-EU Economic Corridor (IMEC) was announced in September this year. But these initiatives are yet to experience any manifestation in reality - and it's tempting to wonder if they ever will.But if we look at the actual history and reality of US foreign policy, it becomes clear that the US does actually have its own BRI: the Bomb and Ruin Initiative.The Bomb and Ruin Initiative started in earnest in 1950 with the launch of the Korean War, in which an estimated four million people were killed. The initiative continued with the Vietnam War, the brutal 1965 coup in Indonesia, the coups and proxy wars in Guatemala, Angola, Brazil, Chile, Mozambique, Argentina, Nicaragua, Grenada, just to name a few.The flagship Bomb and Ruin Initiative project this century so far has been the illegal war on Iraq. Hundreds of thousands of civilians were killed. The country was flattened and its development set back by decades. China has taken a significantly different approach with respect to Iraq. Indeed Iraq is one of the major recipients of infrastructure investment under the BRI, with a vast array of bridges, roads and railways being constructed, alongside energy and telecommunications infrastructure. China is committed to building some 7,000 schools in Iraq. Iraq of course is best known for its abundance of oil - certainly that has been a central motivating factor for a century of British and US interference - but these days China is leading the investment in Iraq's growing solar energy industry. The world can look forward to the day when Iraq is an advanced, prosperous country, and a green energy superpower.In Iraq, the contrast between the BRI and the Bomb and Ruin Initiative is quite stark. So much so that there's a popular saying: ""America bombs, China builds.""This contrast is emblematic of the US' and China's role in the world in general.The US has brought misery and destruction to Afghanistan, that long-suffering country, with a 20-year war and occupation, and now cruel sanctions put in place to prevent the country from getting back on its feet.The US and its allies bombed Libya into the Stone Age, turning it from a relatively prosperous country - with the highest Human Development Index in Africa - into a failed state.The US has been a key player in fomenting and perpetuating the devastating war in Syria, supporting the emergence of terrorist groups in a strategy of regime change, and then using the presence of those same groups as a justification for its own uninvited and unwanted military presence in the country.About two weeks ago, the US responded to attacks on its illegal Syria facilities not by dismantling the facilities but by carrying out air strikes against Syria government sites. It's no secret that the US is the driving force behind the war in Ukraine. The essential character of this conflict is a proxy war to weaken Russia.With the sponsorship and total support of the US, Israel is showing no regard at all for the people of Gaza. Already more than 10,000 people have been killed. The UN has called it a ""children's graveyard."" The people of the world want a ceasefire; China, Russia, Brazil and many others have called for a ceasefire. But the US - along with its most dependable ally, Britain - is standing in the way.The US gets criticized for not building enough infrastructure. However, the US is building plenty of infrastructure of war and aggression: 800 overseas military bases; the stationing of nuclear-enabled missiles and warplanes in Japan, Guam and South Korea, along with tens of thousands of US troops; the placement of the THAAD so-called missile defence system in Guam and South Korea; the AUKUS trilateral nuclear pact between the US, UK and Australia. When it comes to the project of containing and encircling China, the US has no problem with building infrastructure.The stark difference between China's BRI and the US' BRI is clear for all to see.The US is pursuing a hegemonic, imperialist project; a Project for a New US Century. It is spreading death and destruction in pursuit of its own selfish economic and political interests. Meanwhile, China is pursuing what it calls a global community of shared future - described by President Xi Jinping as ""an open, inclusive, clean and beautiful world that enjoys lasting peace, universal security and common prosperity, charting a bright future for human development.""This is an inspiring, democratic and inclusive vision that is rapidly gaining broad support around the globe.The author is a British author and independent political commentator. opinion@globaltimes.com.cn",OPINION,VIEWPOINT,Illustration: Liu Rui/GT,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'BRI': ('MISC', 7), 'Third': ('MISC', 1), 'for International Cooperation': ('MISC', 1), 'Mombasa': ('MISC', 1), 'Standard Gauge Railway': ('MISC', 1), 'China - Laos Railway': ('MISC', 5), 'Jakarta - Bandung High - Speed Railway': ('MISC', 3), 'Norwegian': ('MISC', 1), 'Build Back Better World': ('MISC', 1), 'B3W': ('MISC', 1), 'India': ('MISC', 1), 'EU Economic Corridor': ('MISC', 1), 'IMEC': ('MISC', 1), 'Bomb': ('MISC', 3), 'R': ('MISC', 3), 'Initiative': ('MISC', 3), 'Korean': ('MISC', 1), 'G': ('MISC', 1), 'Belt and Road Forum': ('ORG', 1), 'Friends of Socialist China': ('ORG', 1), 'Beijing': ('LOC', 1), 'Asia': ('LOC', 1), 'Africa': ('LOC', 1), 'Latin America': ('LOC', 1), 'Middle East': ('LOC', 2), 'Caribbean': ('LOC', 1), 'Pacific': ('LOC', 1), 'Nairobi': ('LOC', 1), 'Kenya': ('LOC', 1), 'Laos': ('LOC', 1), 'Indonesia': ('LOC', 2), 'US': ('LOC', 3), 'Vietnam': ('LOC', 1), 'Guatemala': ('LOC', 1), 'Angola': ('LOC', 1), 'Brazil': ('LOC', 1), 'Chile': ('LOC', 1), 'Mozambique': ('LOC', 1), 'Argentina': ('LOC', 1), 'Nicaragua': ('LOC', 1), 'Erik Solheim': ('PER', 1)}"
371,Upholding multilateralism: a common task for China and the EU,Ou Shi,2023-11-08,"The world is undergoing unprecedented changes, changes not necessarily liked by all. EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell expressed concern about multipolarity without multilateralism in his blog. He noted that in a more and more multipolar world, multilateralism is in retreat. To him, it is a paradox that while the number of participants in the game increases, the rules governing the world are running out of steam. To be fair, multipolarity or the participation of more countries in world affairs, can be seen as a manifestation of democracy in international relations and should be welcomed. Multilateralism is indeed essential to making the world order better serve the interests of all humanity. However, one needs to understand what factors are undermining multilateralism before attempting to revive it.Posing a threat to multilateralism is unilateralism and hegemonism, nothing else. Over the past decades, the US, the world's only superpower, has acted unilaterally for its own interests, starting wars without UN authorization, withdrawing from multilateral treaties or organizations as it sees fit, imposing unilateral sanctions at the cost of the livelihood of other nations, and even suppressing foreign companies simply because they are more competitive. The US is no longer a champion but a violator of the post-war multilateral system whose actions have seriously weakened the UN-centered multilateral framework. Multilateralism requires the observation of rules. However, when people talk about rules and a rules-based international order, they need to be clear what the rules are. Are they the rules enshrined in the UN Charter, international law, or some self-made rules by a superpower or a small group of powers? At the core of multilateralism is the UN and international law. Multilateralism will be shaken if countries are allowed to do as they wish, bypassing internationally recognized norms. This is what is happening in the G7, AUKUS, and many other blocs led by the US.  Globalization has reshaped the international landscape. Emerging economies now account for half of the world's GDP and contribute to over 60 percent of global growth. The redistribution of wealth leads to the need for reform and improvement of global governance. The time when the club of the rich makes the decisions is over. At the same time, the Global South is also breaking silence on the political front. With conflicts ongoing in Ukraine and Gaza, countries have made their voices heard, criticizing the double standards of the West. While this ever-changing world urgently needs new rules, the US refuses reform and blames other countries for cooperating under regional or minilateral frameworks. In fact, this kind of cooperation advances, not undermines, multilateralism. For instance, the launch of RCEP is a major step toward trade facilitation and a major growth driver for the world's largest free trade area. The concept of open regionalism has guided ASEAN in practicing multilateralism. Thanks to BRICS, Shanghai Cooperation Organization, and the BRI, countries are making equal-footed and constructive efforts to achieve mutual benefits. This is beyond reproach as the cooperation is open, for the common good, and consistent with the purposes and principles of the UN Charter.Effective multilateralism calls for major-country coordination, which has been absent for too long. At the worst time of the global financial crisis back in 2008, the G20 served as a primary platform for major economies to pull the world out of the crisis through cooperation. In sharp contrast, ever since the outbreak of COVID-19, there has been no coordination or collaboration, but finger-pointing. As a result of the US trying to hold China down politically, economically and technologically, the world sees increasing division and tension. The EU's characterization of China as a systemic rival does not help either. Like it or not, the world is changing. Multipolarity is happening before our eyes. Rather than worrying about the changes, it is time for the EU to consider what should be done. As a supporter of multilateralism, the EU has a natural partner, China. The two sides can open a new journey of upholding multilateralism together. This is a journey of building closer business ties and advancing globalization. A commercially-linked world is less likely to fall into chaos. This is a journey of increasing political and security cooperation. A war-torn Ukraine or Middle East benefits no one. On this journey, China and the EU should say no to unilateralism together and support reforms that will give the Global South more say and representation. It will not be easy but it will be worth it.  The author is an observer on international affairs. opinion@globaltimes.com.cn",OPINION,VIEWPOINT,China EU relations,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'EU': ('ORG', 1), 'UN': ('ORG', 4), 'AU': ('ORG', 1), 'Josep Borrell': ('PER', 1), 'US': ('LOC', 3), 'South': ('LOC', 1), 'Charter': ('MISC', 1)}"
372,Israel doesn’t have a clear strategy for what it wants to do in Gaza: former Palestinian negotiator,Xie Wenting and Bai Yunyi,2023-11-08,"Editor's Note: The total number of Palestine deaths in Gaza has surpassed 10,000 since the latest round of Hamas-Israel conflict started on October 7, 2023, according to the Health Ministry in Gaza. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has urged for a humanitarian ceasefire amid the unfolding catastrophe in Gaza that grows more dire with each passing hour. Will a ceasefire be possible? How do external factors, such as unconditional US support of Israel, play into this conflict? What's the deadlock in the Palestinian-Israeli Conflict? Global Times reporters Xie Wenting and Bai Yunyi (Global Times) spoke with Yezid Sayigh (Sayigh), former adviser and negotiator in the Palestine delegation to the peace talks with Israel?and currently a senior fellow at the Malcolm H. Kerr Carnegie Middle East Center, and got answers to these pressing questions and more.   Yezid Sayigh Photo: Xie Wenting/GTGT: Based on your understanding, what's the latest situation in the Gaza, and particularly with regard to the humanitarian conditions and the impact on the civilians there?Sayigh: There's a situation emerging of intense, immense human suffering for a civilian population of over 2 million people in front of the whole world. The humanitarian conditions are extraordinarily bad. The Israel army has ordered about 1 million people to leave the north of the strip for the south. However, they are also bombing the south and have been bombing the border crossing with Egypt, which has prevented the arrival of humanitarian aid. This is a situation of total terror for the civilian population in which Israel instructions are contradictory. They are basically ignoring any sort of requirements to work with UN agencies and provide independent verification that international humanitarian law is being observed. Global Times: The tragedy in the Gaza did not start with the outbreak of this recent conflict. Could you tell us about what it has been like living in Gaza over these years?Sayigh: The Gaza is a tiny territory that measures about 45 kilometers long and between 9 and 15 kilometers wide. It is a densely populated area with 2.25 million people. The water they rely on for drinking comes from underground sources. However, Israel has been diverting a significant portion of this water, leading to the intrusion of seawater into the aquifer beneath Gaza, polluting the water that people use for washing and drinking. I started with this dramatic example to illustrate the challenging living conditions faced by Palestine in Gaza.The Israelis, although not physically present on the border, insist on certain security protocols. This means that the siege of Gaza is, in fact, entirely controlled by Israel, with 100 percent authority. Israel has maintained a regime of control, exemplified by the limited supply of fuel. They justify this restriction by claiming that the lack of it would aid Hamas and other organizations. However, the cruelest manifestation of Israel control is their scientific calculation of the daily caloric needs of each person to survive. They restrict the food supply to match their calculated scientific requirements for the 2.25 million people in Gaza. Thus, no more food can enter Gaza than what Israel deems necessary based on these calculations. This extraordinary form of control can be seen as a scientific occupation, highlighting the nature of Israel dominance over Gaza. This is why people call it an open air prison and it's a prison where they don't have much room to run away and go somewhere else if there is bombing and fighting. Palestine conduct a search and rescue operation after Israel attacks on Al-Maghazi refugee camp, in Deir Al Balah, Gaza,on November 6, 2023. Photo: VCGGT: Do you think this conflict will continue to escalate and expand? Will it potentially evolve into a larger, even more comprehensive war? If that happens, what does it mean for the region and the world?Sayigh: In the immediate term, there will be escalation. There already is escalation. Israel forces on the ground, including commandos, have conducted limited ground operations in different parts of the north and the center of the Gaza in the last few days. What I think is really important here is that behind all the talks, the bombing, all the drama, and the thunder of bombs, if you look carefully, it seems pretty evident that until at least very recently, the Israel government didn't actually have a clear strategy for what it wants to do in Gaza. They don't have an idea of the political end result. So, they talk about destroying Gaza. They talk about destroying Hamas. Israel has even called, in public, for the killing of every single member of Hamas. This could be 30,000 to 50,000 people, and maybe even more people if we count all the members. But this is just talk for the domestic constituency. All of this doesn't necessarily mean that the Israel leadership has an actual clear plan. They don't know that even if they achieve full victory as they define it, they will still have about 2.3 million Palestine living in the Gaza in horrific conditions, which were already bad.There isn't a long-term political goal that produces stability in Gaza. What I fear here is that we are faced with a right-wing movement in Israel, which is actively pushing an ultra nationalist, far right agenda in the West Bank and Jerusalem every day, with Israel government's support. Global Times: How do you evaluate the role of the US in the conflict? Sayigh: I think Joe Biden is implementing a complex political strategy, but I do not think he is sufficiently dedicated to finding a genuine political solution to the Palestinian-Israeli Conflict conflict and achieving Palestine statehood. I do not believe he is fully committed to compelling current or future Israel governments to provide the necessary territorial and political freedom.What Joe Biden recently said is intriguing, where he acknowledges the necessity of making a serious effort to restore a political solution and rebuild the possibility of a two-state solution, with a Palestine state alongside Israel. However, I don't believe he will invest enough political capital to make this happen. It's too late, and unfortunately, I don't think the Israelis, US, Palestine, and others are in a position to reach an agreement in six months, or even a year or two that would lead to Palestine statehood and self-determination.Joe Biden's remarks are simply the realization that the only logical outcome is to find a solution that works for Gaza. The only logical political solution for Gaza requires a political solution that includes the rest of the occupied Palestine territories and provides Palestine statehood for all Palestine. In other words, there is no solution for Gaza alone. What Joe Biden will not do, in the meantime, is push for a ceasefire. This is partly because he and other West leaders want to demonstrate their total support for Israel for their own domestic political reasons. Therefore, they are willing to see the weakening of the international order and international law for their domestic political reasons.Additionally, I feel that Joe Biden, in particular, is conducting a complex political strategy. By embracing Israel wholeheartedly and giving them unconditional political and military support, he is allowing Israel to conduct a very vicious bombing campaign that is killing thousands of Palestine civilians. He may not want this, but he's not going to stop the Israelis from doing it. Partly, I think, in order to prevent the more far-right and right-wing Israelis from escalating the situation and avoiding accountability for their own political failures.Joe Biden is trying to give Israel a lot of leeway and freedom of action in Gaza, but at the same time, he wants to restrain them from expanding the war with Hezbollah and Iran, or expelling millions of Palestine to Egypt and Jordan, which would undermine the entire architecture of US ties with the rest of the Saudi Arabia world. So Joe Biden is working on both goals, allowing Israel a lot of freedom but also trying to restrict its freedom in other areas. Global Times: Do you think there is still room for a ceasefire? What are the obstacles preventing a ceasefire?Sayigh: There will not be one until the Israelis feel they have achieved their goals. However, since the Israelis don't really know what their goals are, it will be a long time before a ceasefire happens because they don't want to stop fighting without achieving visible objectives. They also fear that accepting a ceasefire without achieving their goals will make them look weak and face dissent within their own society. Besides, the Israel military command feels that their belief in their superiority and deterrence was destroyed by Hamas on October 7, and they want to restore the confidence of the Israel public in the superiority of the Israel army.Both the political leadership and the military command of Israel, for different reasons, do not want to stop the fighting until they feel they have restored their political position, protected themselves from accountability, and restored their strategic deterrence.Global Times: You were once a negotiator for Palestine in the Palestinian-Israeli Conflict negotiations. Over the years, the Palestinian-Israeli Conflict issue has been in a prolonged deadlock and even been marginalized. What do you think are the reasons behind this?Sayigh: In the early 1990s, it became possible to initiate a direct Palestinian-Israeli Conflict peace process, wherein the governments of Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization (Palestine Liberation Organization) recognized each other and established a new form of political dialogue that was previously unattainable. This possibility arose due to significant changes in the international and regional order. The end of the Cold War, the dissolution of the Soviet Union, and the emergence of US hegemony played crucial roles. So, at the international level, the global order has changed. At the regional level, the regional order has also changed. Besides, domestically in Israel, the arrival of hundreds of thousands of Soviet Jews strengthened the Labor Party for a short period of time. Among Palestine, the rise of Hamas challenged the leadership of Palestine Liberation Organization leader Yasser Arafat and the nationalist mainstream movement, Fatah. Therefore, domestically, regionally, and internationally, all these factors pushed for the Palestine Liberation Organization leadership and the Israel leadership under the Labor Party to find room for a peace deal and to prefer it over other alternatives. However, since the collapse of the peace process in the year 2000, the international order has returned to one of multipolar rivalry. Even at the regional level, we have witnessed a new type of cold war between different Saudi Arabia states, between Iran and some Saudi Arabia states, and between Turkey and the Saudis, as well as Turkey and Egypt.We are currently experiencing very negative international and regional dynamics. Moreover, the right-wing faction in Israel politics has gained dominance, opposing the establishment of a Palestine state. We are also facing a very negative international environment in which West powers have abdicated their role in forcing the increasingly right-wing Israel government to pursue peace. I fear that there is no return to a meaningful political negotiation process. I'm afraid that we need to wait for many years, perhaps 10, 20, 30, or even 50 to 60 years, before the Palestine can hope for a genuine offer of independence. This offer could either involve them becoming full equal citizens of the State of Israel, which controls the entire territory, or having their own state where they can live in freedom and dignity. Unfortunately, I do not foresee either of these outcomes happening in the rest of my life. Global Times: China has been making efforts to facilitate a political settlement to this conflict. How do you evaluate the role of China?Sayigh: In relation to Gaza and Palestine, China has always maintained a principled position of support for Palestine national self-determination. China was one of the very first countries, and perhaps the very first non-Saudi Arabia country, to receive a delegation of Palestine national leaders, including Yasser Arafat and a delegation of the Palestine Liberation Organization, in 1964 and 1965. This occurred before any other country had recognized the Palestine. Therefore, China has a long-term position that can be beneficial in the current situation. However, the challenge lies in translating this position into political influence. China's options are somewhat limited, but there are some useful actions it can take. One such action is diplomatic engagement. It is crucial for China to maintain a consistent and proactive stance at the UN, supporting humanitarian law, advocating for humanitarian aid to Gaza, urging for a ceasefire, and aligning with other UN members in pressuring the United States, its allies, and the Europeans to adopt positions that adhere more closely to international law.",IN-DEPTH,IN-DEPTH,"A view of Rafah, southern Gaza, after an Israeli air strike, on November 6, 2023.

373,US guarantee of impunity and lack of accountability foster excessive actions by Israel: former Israeli negotiator,Xie Wenting and Bai Yunyi,2023-11-08,"Editor's Note: The total number of Palestine deaths in Gaza has surpassed 10,000 since the latest round of Hamas-Israel conflict started on October 7, 2023, according to the Health Ministry in Gaza. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has urged for a humanitarian ceasefire amid the unfolding catastrophe in Gaza that grows more dire with each passing hour. Will a ceasefire be possible? How do external factors, such as unconditional US support of Israel, play into this conflict? What's the deadlock in the Palestinian-Israeli Conflict? Global Times reporters Xie Wenting and Bai Yunyi (Global Times) spoke with Ex-Israel peace negotiator Daniel Levy (Levy), the president of the US/Middle East Project and got answers to these pressing questions and more.   Daniel Levy  Photo: Xie Wenting/GTGT: Pentagon and some US officials have voiced that they do not support a ceasefire in the current Palestine-Israel conflict, saying that it only benefits Hamas. What's your take on it?Levy: The US military and US politicians are in the same place on this, but the US is quite isolated in the world. In this regard, its allies in EU and Israel have taken a similar position. However, when the UN voted for an immediate truce, only 14 countries, including Israel and the US, voted against this resolution.Now, what is worrying is this statement that only Hamas would benefit from a ceasefire. It's a very curious statement. We think that approximately 10,000 Palestine civilians have been killed in Gaza in less than 4 weeks. The accurate number seems to be about 4,000 children. For the US to say that only Hamas will benefit suggests that they place no value on Palestine civilian lives. I believe many people are shocked, including those in the US by the fact that there is such a blatant and transparent position, which values one life differently from another. I think this is a very bad moment for the US on the international stage.I understand the argument which sets forth that if there is a ceasefire, Israel will not be able to continue its military effort against Hamas. However, there are two things. First, we cannot conduct that military effort in violation of all international norms, laws, and conventions. There are rules even in war. Just like the resistance against an illegal occupation, which is legal, armed resistance is legal against an illegal occupation. But it has rules. So self-defense by Israel also has rules. You cannot pretend that these rules don't exist. Second, history tells us that if people are kept depressed like this, you cannot defeat them militarily. It's a very counterproductive and dangerous US position.Global Times: Based on your analysis, what is likely to happen in the coming days? What's the worst scenario that you fear may happen?Levy: It's an interesting question. In recent days, Israel has proceeded with its ground operation inside Gaza. ?The reason it is incredibly congested and densely populated with Palestine in such a confined area is due to the fact that Israel forcefully relocated the Palestine to this region between 1947 and 1949.What is Israel aiming to achieve? They have surrounded Gaza, dividing it. Israel military officials have stated that they may need to remain in Gaza for three months to carry out military operations. Afterward, there would be a residual presence, with Israel potentially remaining in Gaza for another nine months. This suggests that the Israelis lack a clear plan.We tend to think of the Israel military as a very strategic and powerful force, which it certainly is. Israel is an undeclared nuclear power with nuclear arms, and it receives guaranteed support from the US for acquiring the most sophisticated weaponry. Israel also has its own arms industry. However, it came as quite a shock that Israel's security doctrine is based on deterrence, which includes early warning and military preponderance for domination. This security doctrine is unlikely to succeed if they continue to try to maintain permanent control over another people, especially considering the opposition they face from much of the region. As a result, this security doctrine is bound to collapse. Although they may attempt to reassert it, it is destined to fail.No one in Israel is providing an answer to the question you asked. Do they think they will stay there permanently? Will Palestine allow for some outside force to come and take control? An outside force may want to intervene. Therefore, there is no real answer, suggesting a high level of dysfunction in Israel strategic thinking. It seems their plan is to inflict as much damage as possible until the world intervenes, and then reassess the situation.However, we must also acknowledge that the individuals currently leading this operation in Israel have been greatly discredited due to what happened on October 7. This significant failure and terrible incident have led to the assumption that there will be an inquiry into what occurred on that day. Consequently, many people may be forced out of their positions. These individuals are prolonging the war because once it ends, their personal careers will come to an end as well.Global Times: Do you still see a possible ceasefire in the near future?Levy: The pressure for a ceasefire might grow more quickly. Maybe Israel will manage to keep going for so long, but it's very risky because the longer it goes on in Gaza, the more likely there will be a regional explosion. There have been exchanges between local militias and either US or Israel forces. The US has positioned its warships off the coast, so the US could get dragged into this war. Iran could also get dragged into this war. The rest of the world is looking at this and saying we have quite a lot of crises. Besides, there are other arguments as to why there may be a ceasefire sooner rather than later. First, things are deteriorating across the rest of the Palestine arena in the occupied West Bank and Jerusalem. Second, civilian casualties are reaching alarming levels. Third, this conflict is causing the US and the West to appear increasingly isolated. Fourth, the more destruction inflicted upon Gaza, the more challenging it will be to rebuild the region. Fifth, Israel lacks a plan for the aftermath of the conflict. Therefore, there are numerous reasons why a ceasefire is becoming more likely. Lastly, the longer the war persists, the less feasible it becomes to release the prisoners held in Gaza, increasing the likelihood of their death.However, the US is not forcing Israel into a ceasefire at the moment. Israel remains angry, vengeful, and confused. It is not agreeing to a ceasefire, but I think this dynamic can shift. Many people are asking the question: How long can Israel maintain its reservists away from their employment? Much of the Israel economy is at a standstill. Israel is beginning to lose soldiers in Gaza. The deaths of Israel soldiers increase every day. These are the two tensions. There is a lot of criticism inside the US, within Joe Biden's own party, that he is not pushing for a ceasefire. So it's possible that Israel will have several more weeks, but it's also very likely that the pressure will increase to end this sooner.Global Times: You once were an Israel peace negotiator. Over the years, the Palestinian-Israeli Conflict issue has been in a prolonged deadlock and even marginalized. What do you think are the reasons behind this?Levy: There were basic parameters outlined for a deal, which would not be an ideal solution. Essentially, the idea was for Palestine to accept a state in only 22 percent of the former mandate area, as Palestine had been colonized and Israel had established its own settler colony. The agreement entailed Israel's withdrawal, allowing for the creation of a Palestine state. Due to the US' significant influence and strong relationship with Israel, it was expected that the US would ensure the achievement of this deal. However, this never materialized. Instead, Israel continued to place more and more illegal settlers in the land designated for the Palestine state.If you are occupying another territory, there are rules. There is international law. You are not allowed to move your civilian population into the territory. Israel violated this and many other international laws. So, instead of securing this deal, Israel continued to deepen the occupation. For the Palestine, the main Palestine faction, Fatah, which is the other party to Hamas, controlled the piano. The people who made the deal with Israel expected to get a state and stopped using armed struggle, negotiating instead. They became less and less credible in the eyes of their own people because things kept getting worse. So, Hamas kept getting stronger. When we were negotiating, we understood some of these dynamics. We thought we could achieve a deal. To be honest, quite often we were negotiating with ourselves because there were different views on the Israel side. You had a more pragmatic, realist Israel position. You had a more ideological Israel position or maximalist Israel position. We never put forward a deal that would have led to peace, and the US, instead of ensuring it happened, actually made sure Israel was not held accountable when Israel refused to pursue the peaceful option. So, this is how it collapsed, but it has been collapsed now for a long time.For a long time, there have been no serious peace efforts. What we hear are people saying ""two states,"" but these words are meaningless. There is no accountability for Israel in preventing the establishment of two states. Furthermore, the situation on the ground has worsened. The collapse of the international architecture is evident, as the process has been monopolized by the US. Occasionally, the Quartet (comprising the UN, EU, Russia, and the US) has been involved, and sometimes Saudi Arabia states have participated. However, the US and Israel have consistently worked to marginalize the Quartet, paralyze the UN, and improve Saudi Arabia-Israel relations without addressing the Palestine issue. All of these things were not serious. All of these things made peace less likely. All of those things were proof that we need a different international architecture. This can't be left just to the US.Global Times: From your point of view, what is the solution to the Palestinian-Israeli Conflict issue?Levy: There are four main points to consider. First, Palestine politics is dysfunctional and not representative of its people. The opportunity to include Hamas within the Palestine Liberation Organization (Palestine Liberation Organization) was hindered by the interference of countries like the US and Israel. Therefore, it is crucial to allow Palestine to rebuild their political system and remove any obstacles. Friendly third countries should support and encourage this process, as the collapse of Palestine politics has contributed to the current situation.Second, if Israel believes it can act without consequences, it will continue to do so. The US' guarantee of Israel impunity and lack of accountability has fostered a culture of war and excessive actions by Israel. This has led to strategic miscalculations, as Israel believed it could control millions of Palestine without granting them rights or a state, which many consider to be an apartheid system. Israel's confidence in its actions stems from the assurance provided by the US. So the second thing that needs to happen is for Israel to understand that there is a choice to be made and that there are costs for continuing to treat the Palestine like this. Third, we cannot leave this just to the US. We need this to be recognized as a major global crisis. The Palestinian-Israeli Conflict issue is part of the global crisis. This is not a marginal issue. We need other states, such as the G20 or the BRICS, parts of the Global South, and parts of the Saudi Arabia world, to get more engaged so that there is some balance in how America manages this issue. We need a new contact group or a new architecture. This is true of many things in the world, but it is now particularly true of this crisis.Finally, with the involved parties themselves, we need to clarify that the traditional position is for two states, but the international community is open to considering other ideas as long as they recognize the rights and equality of all people. We must encourage the parties to see each other as human beings and to acknowledge the reality of their situation. Some may argue that Israel cannot negotiate until Hamas is destroyed, while others may question how Palestine can negotiate with Israel when it has caused the deaths of thousands of children. However, this is the nature of conflict, and the path to stability lies in politics and negotiations. Instead of imposing a solution, we must emphasize that a situation through which one people live with rights and another people live without rights is unacceptable. If Israel refuses to withdraw its settlements, perhaps a one-state solution could be considered. Similarly, if Palestine insist on the return of refugees, maybe we can revisit the idea of two states. The key is to provide options and encourage the parties to engage in political discussions. These are my suggestions.",IN-DEPTH,IN-DEPTH,"An Israeli soldier arranges artillery shells near the border with the Gaza Strip in southern Israel, on November 6, 2023.

374,US focus on Indo-Pacific will stretch it thinner,Su Lun,2023-11-08,"Despite grappling with conflicts between Russia and Ukraine and between Israel and Palestine, the US is still trying to focus on the Indo-Pacific region. US Defense Secretary Lloyd J. Austin will embark on his ninth visit to the Indo-Pacific region this week, with visits to India, South Korea and Indonesia. The US Department of Defense stated that this visit demonstrates the increasingly close cooperation between the US and its allies.US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who just concluded the G7 Foreign Ministers' Meeting in Japan, will also travel to South Korea and India to advance efforts to ""support a free and open Indo-Pacific region.""The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff will also visit the Indo-Pacific region soon. Although not explicitly stated, these agendas are almost all aimed at containing China. Sun Xihui, an associate research fellow with the National Institute of International Strategy at the China Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times that against the backdrop of the conflicts between Russia and Ukraine and between Israel and Palestine, the Joe Biden administration still sends high-ranking officials to the Indo-Pacific region, and these high-profile visits show that the Joe Biden administration does not want the progress of the Indo-Pacific Strategy to be affected by the two conflicts. This clearly demonstrates that the Joe Biden administration, or the US political decision-making circle, still considers countering China as a top priority.Li Wei, an expert on national security at the China Institute of Contemporary International Relations, told the Global Times that regardless of any geopolitical conflict in the world, the US regards China as its main strategic competitor and this will not change. The US' strategic focus on the Indo-Pacific region will continue.The Pentagon boasted that Austin's trip will demonstrate how ""diverse"" the US ""security architecture"" in the Indo-Pacific region is. Sun analyzed that the diversity of the regional security architecture mentioned by the US mainly refers to the US Asia-Pacific alliance system as the core and then extends outward, including bilateral and small multilateral mechanisms. These extended regions involve Northeast Asia, Southeast Asia, and the South China Sea, among others. This diversity includes not only the diversity of the main body but also the diversity of mechanisms and coverage areas. However, Sun pointed out that the goal of the US to extend or deepen bilateral alliances into trilateral or quadrilateral alliance mechanisms faces great challenges.An article in Foreign Policy magazine on Tuesday said, ""The United States needs stronger alliances precisely because it can no longer manage the many global problems it faces alone. This is especially true for the rise of China."" Sun told the Global Times that China's rise is unique in that it rises largely on its own, despite China's openness to the outside world, including the West. Therefore, China's rise will not be hindered or jeopardized by external pressure. From this perspective, no matter how the US boasts its alliance system, it cannot suppress China's rise.The US should be aware that its allies and partners will not solely align with the US and they will make decisions based on their own interests. The recent improvement in China-Australia relations serves as an example. While US pundits worry that China will seek opportunities to sow discord into US alliance system and test alliance commitments, they had better look into whether the US still has confidence in its allies and its own influence and strength. The worries from within the US show that the US is not that confident in its relations with its allies. As the Russia-Ukraine war and the Israel-Palestine conflict drag on, the US is providing weapons to escalate the war while advancing the Indo-Pacific Strategy. This has not only increased tensions in China's surrounding areas but also brought negative impact to regional countries. Neither China nor other countries in the Indo-Pacific region want to see this happen. Unity is a cliché used by the US to seduce allies and partners. But behind this is Washington's strong push to achieve self-interests and forcefully bind regional countries to promote camp confrontation. The goal of its strategy to contain China is not only self-serving, but also arrogant.Currently, due to the constraints of the Russia-Ukraine war and the Palestinian-Israeli Conflict conflict, the US has fallen into strategic overstretch. In this situation, the US is still eager to increase its input in the Asia-Pacific region in an attempt to contain China. However, it is important to note that containing China is already a mission impossible. If the current approach persists, the US will only find itself stretched too thin.The author is a reporter with the Global Times. opinion@globaltimes.com.cn",OPINION,VIEWPOINT,Illustration: Chen Xia/GT,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'Russia': ('LOC', 2), 'Ukraine': ('LOC', 2), 'Israel': ('LOC', 2), 'Palestine': ('LOC', 2), 'US': ('LOC', 10), 'Indo': ('LOC', 7), 'Pacific': ('LOC', 8), 'India': ('LOC', 2), 'South Korea': ('LOC', 2), 'Indonesia': ('LOC', 1), 'Japan': ('LOC', 1), 'China': ('LOC', 3), 'US Asia': ('LOC', 11), 'Northeast Asia': ('LOC', 1), 'Southeast Asia': ('LOC', 1), 'South China': ('LOC', 4), 'United': ('LOC', 1), 'Defense': ('ORG', 1), 'US Department of Defense': ('ORG', 2), 'Joint Chiefs of Staff': ('ORG', 1), 'National Institute of International Strategy': ('ORG', 1), 'China Academy of Social Sciences': ('ORG', 1), 'Global Times': ('ORG', 2), 'China Institute of Contemporary International Relations': ('ORG', 1), 'Pentagon': ('ORG', 1), 'Sea': ('ORG', 1), 'Lloyd J.

375,US in awkward position as divisions grow with Israel and allies,Fan Anqi,2023-11-08,"With cracks widening in recent days after the White House failed to persuade Israel over a range of issues in Gaza, Washington, unable to bridge the gaps among its closest allies, finds itself in an increasingly awkward position. An insubstantial joint statement was released at the last minute after a meeting of the G7 foreign ministers on Wednesday, which experts said will be of little actual help to solve the crisis but reflects allies' growing distrust in Washington. Winding up a two-day meeting in Tokyo, the G7 foreign ministers issued a ""unified message"" on the Israel-Palestine conflict late on Wednesday evening, including a call for a humanitarian pause in the fighting and a ""peace process,"" Reuters reported, citing Japanese Foreign Minister Yoko Kamikawa.Analysts considered the statement highlights the difficulties of reaching a consensus, and it has little substantial content that would actually help the humanitarian disaster or deescalate the tension, but is only a reiteration of previous appeals. While Blinken has called on G7 members to ""come together in the face of this crisis and to speak, as we do, with one clear voice,"" the group of rich nations is becoming the latest US-led clique to find itself divided by the war, analysts said. The White House suggested on Tuesday that Israel forces should not reoccupy Gaza, soon after Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu commented that the country will have the ""overall security responsibility"" in Gaza for an ""indefinite period"" after the war ends, CNN reported.It is also the latest of a series of views Netanyahu has voiced that diverge from the White House, following Israel's blunt rejection of US Secretary of State Antony Blinken's calls for a ""humanitarian pause"" to allow hostages and civilians to leave Gaza and for aid for Palestine to enter.""There is nothing much it [the White House] can do to stop the pace of Israel,"" Tian Wenlin, a research fellow at the China Institutes of Contemporary International Relations, told the Global Times on Wednesday, adding that the powerful influence of the Jewish lobby. Tian noted that the widening gap between the US and Israel is a result of their different goals and demands. While Israel aims to deter the Palestine and seek retaliation, the US seeks to de-escalate the conflict as soon as possible, so that its other agendas will not be affected. Zhu Yongbiao, director of the Center for Afghanistan Studies at Lanzhou University, believe that the ""stern"" warnings of the White House appear more like an act of ""double dealing,"" aimed at absolving itself of responsibility amid outbursts of fury domestically and internationally, as well as a deepening rift with allies.""The US' double standards and excessive bias toward Israel are leading to a collapse of its credibility and trust among allies. For the US alliance system, the Ukraine crisis is a test of Washington's strengths, while the Palestine crisis is a test of conscience. And out of their conscience, its allies are distancing themselves from the US, albeit they still have to align verbally with it,"" Lü Xiang, a research fellow at the China Academy of Social Sciences told the Global Times on Wednesday. The main disagreements lie in how much pressure to put on Israel to make the ""humanitarian pause"" happen, and the implementation of the two-state solution - a proposal that the great majority of countries support, observers said.At last month's UN, France was the only G7 country to support a resolution calling for an ""immediate and sustained"" break in the war and condemning ""all acts of violence aimed at Palestine and Israel civilians."" Canada, Germany, Italy, Japan and the UK abstained while the US voted against, according to media reports.The primary cause of this division is the more-than-obvious double standards the US has displayed on its so-called value-based diplomacy, as seen in the sharp contrast in its attitude toward Ukraine and Palestine, experts said.",CHINA,DIPLOMACY,"US Secretary of State Antony Blinken walks away after his news conference after the Group of 7 Foreign Ministers meetings Wednesday, Nov. 8, 2023, in Tokyo.

376,The Palestine-Israel conflict exacerbates strategic dilemma of the EU,He Zhigao,2023-11-07," The Palestine-Israel conflict has once again become the focus of international attention. Since the outbreak of the Palestine-Israel conflict, EU leaders and their member states have frequently voiced their opinions. However, the lack of consensus within EU institutions exposes the growing divisions within the EU on regional hot-button issues. The Middle East has long been one of the strategic priorities for the EU, as the security and stability of the region are crucial to the EU's strategic interests. The EU has been active in Middle East and North Africa affairs, actively supporting the resolution of the Palestine-Israel conflict. Additionally, the EU has promoted the P5+1 mechanism, becoming a key actor in dialogue, cooperation and resolution of the Iran nuclear issue. However, the EU is also prone to having strategic divergences on Middle Eastern issues. For example, during the Iraq War, there was a division between ""Old"" and ""New"" EU within the EU. Therefore, the resolution of issues in the Middle East region becomes a test for whether the EU can exert global influence and have an independent impact.There are differences between the EU Commission and the Council of the EU. EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen visited Israel on October 18 to show support for Israel. However, the EU Council held a leaders' meeting on October 26, emphasizing the EU's efforts to contribute to a political process based on a two-state solution and calling for the prompt convening of an international peace conference on the Palestine-Israel conflict. Additionally, in the face of the Palestine-Israel conflict, the EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, Josep Borrell, believes that ""Israel has the right to defend [itself], but it has to be done according to the right of international law."" This view differs from von der Leyen's ""biased"" support for Israel. Von der Leyen's position has caused dissatisfaction among EU member states.The new round of conflict between Palestine and Israel poses new challenges to the region and the world. Against the backdrop of the ongoing impact of the Russia-Ukraine conflict on EU security order, the security and stability of the Middle East region has undoubtedly become a new test for the EU in dealing with its neighboring issues, as well as the coordination between crisis management and military capabilities.After the outbreak of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, the weakness of the EU in safeguarding its own security order was exposed. The EU's security agenda is constrained and even dominated by the US, which strengthens the security confrontation with Russia and puts it in a dilemma. Currently, the Palestine-Israel conflict exacerbates the strategic dilemma of the EU. On the one hand, the EU hopes to maintain its influence in the Middle East and promote a ""EU approach"" to the solution. On the other hand, the US wants to maintains its alliance with Israel and promote its hegemony in the region. At the same time, some Europeans, linking the Russia-Ukraine conflict to the Palestine-Israel conflict, believe that the two conflicts put the EU at risk of ""fighting on two fronts.""The Palestine-Israel conflict has regional implications. A ceasefire and a peaceful resolution are urgently needed. In order to prevent the conflict from spreading and becoming a regional conflict, EU leaders have strengthened communication with countries such as Egypt and Jordan, in addition to visiting Israel. China particularly hopes to enhance cooperation with the EU on global governance and regional hotspots, respecting the EU's status as an important global actor, and aiming to achieve peace and stability in the Middle East. In the current round of the Palestine-Israel conflict, the EU should strengthen communication and exchanges with regional countries based on the ""two-state solution"" within the framework of the UN and promote a just resolution of the Palestine issue while strengthening the endogenetic power that maintain security in the Middle East. Undoubtedly, the strategic wisdom of the EU is needed.  The author is a research fellow with the Institute of EU Studies, China Academy of Social Sciences. opinion@globaltimes.com.cn",OPINION,VIEWPOINT,Illustration: Chen Xia/GT,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'Palestine': ('LOC', 6), 'Israel': ('LOC', 10), 'Middle East': ('LOC', 4), 'North Africa': ('LOC', 1), 'Iran': ('LOC', 1), 'Russia': ('LOC', 2), 'Ukraine': ('LOC', 2), 'EU': ('ORG', 18), 'New': ('ORG', 1), 'EU Commission': ('ORG', 20), 'Council of the EU': ('ORG', 19), 'EU Council': ('ORG', 19), 'P': ('MISC', 1), 'Middle Eastern': ('MISC', 1), 'Iraq War': ('MISC', 1), 'Ursula von der Leyen': ('PER', 1), 'Josep Borrell': ('PER', 1), 'von der Leye': ('PER', 1), 'Von der': ('PER', 1)}"
378,G7 seeks common ground on Palestine-Israel war with more visible divergence,Liu Xin,2023-11-07,"Foreign ministers from Group of Seven (G7) nations met in Tokyo on Tuesday in an attempt to find common ground on the Palestine-Israel conflict. However, observers noted that given the growing divergence among member states over the ongoing conflict, the bloc is unlikely to be able to effectively advocate for a cease-fire, which will further underscore the bloc's diminishing influence and its inability to stop the humanitarian crisis in Gaza.As the chair country, Japan is hosting the second G7 foreign ministers' meeting this year in the Minato area of Tokyo on Tuesday and Wednesday. According to Japanese media, officials will exchange views on several major ongoing issues related to international security, especially the Palestine-Israel war and the Ukraine crisis. Japanese media reported that G7 ministers are scheduled to compile an outcome document on Wednesday, in which they are expected to agree on the necessity of ""a pause"" in the conflict to deliver essential supplies to civilians in Gaza. However, the wording may be addressed in general terms given the widening divergences.On October 22, six of the G7 countries, except for Japan, issued a statement siding with Israel. However, as Israel's military operations in Gaza have escalated the humanitarian crisis and even crossed moral boundaries, some members of the group have found it increasingly difficult to tolerate Israel's actions, which has resulted in a growing divide within the G7 among the US and other nations, Yang Xiyu, a senior research fellow at the China Institute of International Studies, told the Global Times. For example, Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida has not visited Israel to show support, although last week, Japan's Foreign Minister Yoko Kamikawa met with Israel and Palestine foreign ministers during a trip to the region. The Japanese minister also pledged $65 million in humanitarian aid and support to Gaza, according to media reports. In handling the Palestine-Israel issue, current G7 chair Japan has adopted a more circumspect stance than its prior strategy of closely following the US, Yang noted, adding that in contrast to the significant influence of Jewish US on US politics, Japan is less affected by Jewish concerns and has not been as deeply involved in Middle East affairs as has the US.Yang said that a more essential reason is Japan's heavy reliance on Middle Eastern oil, which forces it to adopt a more moderate approach than the US and refrain from taking sides between Israel and the Saudi Arabia world.Apart from Japan, the US and EU's differences on the Palestine issue have become increasingly apparent in recent weeks. Liu Zhongmin, a professor at the Middle East Studies Institute of Shanghai International Studies University, noted that many Europeans were more sympathetic to the Palestine before the current crisis. Meanwhile, the EU is becoming more concerned about the war's spillover effects, such the potential for a refugee catastrophe.Even while the governments of several EU nations have expressed support to Israel, public anger at Israel's retaliatory measures in Gaza has been increasing, which has resulted in a spike in violence against Jewish communities and escalating conflicts between different groups, Liu said.Within the EU, there is a growing and alarming rift between pro-Palestine and pro-Israel groups, as well as between Jewish and Muslim groups, the expert noted. There have been large demonstrations in support of Palestine across EU during Israel's ongoing bombardment of Gaza. Thousands of pro-Palestine demonstrators demanded a cease-fire  on Saturday in Berlin, Paris and London, according to the media.Some analysts noted that the US and the EU also differ in how much attention they place on the war in the Middle East and in Ukraine.The G7 foreign ministers are also reportedly to discuss the Ukraine crisis to demonstrate its support for Ukraine will not waver due to the conflict in the Middle East, Reuters reported. Yang noted that it is difficult to say which conflict is more vital, but the EU and the US have different focus - the EU is more concerned about whether the Ukraine crisis will expand or be prolonged, while the US may pay more attention to the Middle East since the conflict in the Middle East may force it to modify its global strategy again.Yang also said the EU was equally concerned about how the conflict in the Middle East would impact them if it is further escalated.According to Liu, if the humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza continues to worsen, the US and Israel will become even more isolated on the global stage. The divide between the US and its partners in the G7 and the rest of the world will also widen. On October 27, the 193-member UN passed a resolution drafted by a group of 22 Saudi Arabia countries that called for a cease-fire by a margin of 121 to 14, with 44 countries abstaining. Among the 14 countries that voted against the cease-fire were Israel, the US, Fiji, Guatemala, the Marshall Islands, Micronesia, Nauru, Papua New Guinea, Paraguay and Tonga. Japan also abstained from the UN resolution. None of the other G7 countries voted with the US. Waning influence of G7As of press time on Tuesday, Palestine health authorities said the death toll from Israel strikes had exceeded 10,000 and UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres said on Monday that Gaza is becoming a ""graveyard for children."" Despite global call, the US has not abandoned its rejection of the cease-fire proposal. US President Joe Biden reaffirmed the US' ""steadfast"" support for Israel on Monday when speaking with Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Liu said there is little chance that the G7 foreign ministers' meeting would produce a workable solution to halt the worsening situation in Gaza. The bloc's final statement on the war between Israel and Palestine would reiterate US rhetoric about a ""pause,"" which is not a solution to the Palestine issue.The G7's discussion over the Palestine issue is more to demonstrate their presence and to lessen the growing pressure globally, Liu said, noting that countries that ought to have stopped Israel have chosen to back off as further tragedies in Gaza are unfolding, highlighting the G7's marginalization in global governance.In addition to the crises in the Middle East and Ukraine, the G7 foreign ministers will discuss ""China's increasing maritime activities."" Some West media claimed that the two nations are utilizing the current conflict to bolster their reputations as the champions of the developing world.  In the midst of a severe humanitarian crisis and escalating war, some countries are still prioritizing their own geopolitical interests and focusing on geopolitical gains, disregarding the risks of war escalation and humanitarian disasters, Yang said.  Yang urged more countries to cooperate in pushing for a cease-fire, saying that every nation that upholds justice and morality should concentrate on finding a solution to the current conflicts in the world, rather than encouraging new hostilities.",CHINA,DIPLOMACY,"Protesters stage a pro-Palestinian demonstration near Japan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs Iikura Guest House in Tokyo on November 7, 2023, where the G7 Foreign Ministers' Meeting was set to begin.Photo:AFP","Reporter, Beijing","Liu Xin co-leads the Global Times China desk.

383,Other countries shouldn’t hold any belief whatsoever in US commitment,Su Lun,2023-11-06,"The Israel-Palestine war is ""taking away the focus"" from the conflict in Ukraine, Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky admitted during a press conference with EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen on Saturday. The Russia-Ukraine war has been ongoing for over 600 days since February 24, 2022. In the eyes of the West countries which support Ukraine, the progress of Ukraine's counteroffensive has been minimal, leading to war fatigue. These countries no longer have the interest, motivation, courage, or financial and human resources to continue supporting Ukraine. The sudden outbreak of the Israel-Palestine conflict has diverted some of the attention and assistance that was originally designated to Ukraine. The US House approved a nearly $14.5 billion military aid package Thursday for Israel, not Ukraine. On Friday, the Joe Biden administration announced additional security assistance of $425 million for Ukraine, a much smaller amount, but it also admitted that the package ""exhausts the remaining USAI funds currently available to support Ukraine."" Some hardline Republican have already opposed continued assistance for Kiev, putting the future of US aid for Ukraine in doubt.This proves that the US-led West just views Ukraine as a pawn that can be set aside whenever necessary.It is evident that the loss of attention has caused panic for Ukraine. For the US, Israel is more strategically important than Ukraine, as Israel matters a lot to the US' Middle East strategy. Comparatively, Ukraine is merely a tool that the US uses to counter Russia. It is highly unlikely that the US would compromise its core interests. Li Haidong, a professor at the China Foreign Affairs University, told the Global Times that relying on West support to achieve victory in the war against Russia is a manifestation of Ukraine's miscalculation. And the US, on which Ukraine hinges its hopes, hardly has the capacity to deal with two wars at the same time. The US has been forced into multiple conflicts of its own making. This is a fatal flaw for the implementation of its grand strategic planning. The US is destined to be unable to solve the fundamental problems of the Israel-Palestine conflict or the Russia-Ukraine war. According to NBC's report on Saturday, US and EU officials have begun quietly talking to the Ukraine government about what possible peace negotiations with Russia might entail to end the war. This could symbolize Ukraine being abandoned by the West and potentially becoming a West outcast. ""It's only a matter of time before the West abandons Ukraine,"" Song Zhongping, a China military expert and TV commentator, told the Global Times. Over 600 days is not a short time span, and West countries' hope to use Ukraine to completely weaken Russia has fallen flat. Based on the current situation of the war, Ukraine is not up to the task envisioned by some West countries and cannot meet the actual needs of containing Russia, Song added.Ukraine cannot militarily defeat Russia, and this is the known outcome when the war just started. The trajectory of the Russia-Ukraine conflict is in the hands of the US. Ukraine has lost its bargaining chips for negotiations, and whatever the negotiation results, Ukraine will have to sacrifice its own interests. Under US pressure, Ukraine and Russia may talk, but in reality, these are talks between the US and Russia. ""Only a consensus between the US and Russia can lead to an end to the Russia-Ukraine conflict,"" said Song.Zelensky may have woken up to the fact that his country is no longer the US' favorite. The bitter experience of Ukraine also makes the world see that the fate of a country must be in the hands of its own people, rather than being manipulated and dominated by such big powers as the US.The US is too selfish to think of the interests of other countries. Countries shouldn't hold any belief whatsoever in US commitment. When the US comes to the conclusion that its investment in a certain country generates more losses than gains, it will abandon that country without a second thought. Look at Afghanistan and Syria, and now Ukraine.

384,"With its stance on Israel-Palestine conflict, US continues to push Global South away",Elias Cepeda,2023-11-06,"The lifespan of my late father, Roberto, coincided with the US' ascendancy to global hegemony. Throughout his life, he witnessed a great deal of US belligerence. We would often watch the news together, and he would regret the US' wars of aggression, coups, and other forms of violent subversions of democracy all over the world. He'd say that ""Much of the rest of the world actually loves America! They love our literature, movies, music and some of our sports.""He'd shake his head, condemn the actions of his country which he loved, and empathize with our victims. His point was that there was, and is, some goodwill toward the US from the rest of the world but we were squandering it and pushing everyone away with our bullying. It was true then, and is only truer now, as US uncritically supports the government of Israel's civilian killing. On this front, the US was certainly not doing itself any favors by militarily occupying dozens of countries, supporting anti-democratic coups, levying murderous sanctions and threatening nations to support our proxy wars. Inside our borders live internally colonized people. These people are divided by race and class with historic wealth stratification, and a decrease in life expectancy despite our great wealth as a country. Then recently the US government decided to remind the world of its support for a country that shows no regard for life bombing hospitals and striking schools. With thousands of its people already kidnapped and held as political prisoners, including many children, factions within the Gaza area of occupied Palestine, which Israel has turned into the world's largest concentration camp, tore through Israel's camp fence and took hostages of its own. Amid mounting violence, not even progressive US politicians can bring themselves to so much as call for a cease-fire. Our president has lied on live television, falsely claiming that he saw ""confirmed"" photos of babies beheaded by Saudi Arabia Palestine, and fans the flames of Islamophobia and anti-Saudi Arabia racism, while denying the death toll of Palestine living under this intensified siege from their colonizers.  US policy and rhetoric on Palestine are at odds with what our eyes can see and what the world's leading human rights organizations say. The world is responding clearly and not buying US policies or propaganda. Marches in support of the people of Palestine against Israel and the US' colonial rule and recent intensified bombardment have sprung up around the world. It is clear that the world, especially the Global South, sees its own reflection in Palestine.As the US continues to help colonize and illegally occupy the land of indigenous people in the Middle East, it isn't hard for the rest of the Global South to be reminded of the ways the US and the West more broadly have and still do dominate them at the tip of a spear. What's more, US power is no longer a take-it-or-leave-it proposition for the rest of the world.The US is no longer the world's only power. Our military arsenal is certainly still large enough to pose an existential threat to the world's population, but we lag in almost every other category pertinent to measuring a power's health. In contrast to the US' domestic decline and inequality, China has all but eliminated extreme poverty within its borders and has become the world's largest economy. The US threatens African and Central and South US nations. China, however, is using its emerging economic strength to support development there with cheap loans. While the US drops bombs around the world each week, China is not at war with a single sovereign nation. While the US lies on behalf of other colonial powers like Israel, helping it bomb hospitals and slander the victims, the China government has publicly called for a cease-fire and vetoed a UN resolution for its problematic language.What's more, the China government, in July, explicitly announced that China is naturally a member of the Global South and will always be a member of the big family of developing countries. China defined its inclusion within the Global South largely by providing an alternative to West hegemony.The US is once more aggressively pushing the Global South away. The US government seems to think this has the effect of tossing these nations away, exiling them into obscurity.Instead, it might only be pushing them into the world's new power, a power which is less warring and more welcoming. The author is a Chicago-based columnist covering US politics and culture.

385,Fury over US’ support for Israel may ‘add uncertainty to 2024 election’,GT staff reporters,2023-11-06,"The mounting disappointment and fury over the Joe Biden administration's one-sided support for Israel may add more uncertainty to the 2024 US election, with US President Joe Biden's support among Saudi Arabia US reportedly plummeting to an all-time low. Analysts said that the Palestine-Israel conflict has accelerated the split in the US and also highlighted its crippled and falling strategy and credibility in the Middle East. A series of polls from the New York Times released on Sunday showed Joe Biden trailing former President Donald Trump in five of six battleground states among registered voters. Moreover, in recent days, the Saudi Arabia US Institute think tank released a study showing a staggering 42 percent drop in support among Saudi Arabia US communities since 2020. Respondents also overwhelmingly said they had a negative attitude toward Joe Biden, with his approval rating tumbling to 29 percent, according to media reports.Though Saudi Arabia US and other Muslims make up a small part of the electorate in the US, their population is growing, and these voters can be a critical voting bloc in tight elections, particularly in a few swing states, for example, Arizona where Joe Biden had been a slight favorite to win the state in 2020, Diao Daming, an associate professor at the Renmin University of China in Beijing, told the Global Times. If more Muslims in crucial swing states make the decision to vote against Joe Biden, the outcome of the 2024 election will not be what Joe Biden wants to see. However, since the election is still a while off and the Palestine-Israel conflict might not last that long, it is still unclear how much the war will affect the outcome of the election, said Diao.The majority of Muslim US, who are unhappy with the Joe Biden administration's backing of Israel, may decide not to vote for either candidate because of Donald Trump's strong support for Israel, said Yuan Zheng, deputy director and a senior fellow of the Institute of US Studies at the China Academy of Social Sciences.Yuan also noted that how the Palestine-Israel war will affect the US presidential election remains unclear given the great influence of Jewish groups in politics, finance and other sectors in the US. But one thing is certain - the divide in US society is further deepening, posing a greater challenge to future governance. Although the Joe Biden administration has subtly changed its tone from throwing firm support behind Israel to urging protection of civilians, criticism toward Joe Biden for refusing to call for a cease-fire has grown. On November 4, tens of thousands of pro-Palestine protesters took to streets across the US and accused Joe Biden of enabling ""genocide"" against Palestine. For Joe Biden, the current urgent issue is to stabilize the situation as soon as possible, and this is why he is pushing for a ""humanitarian pause"" to appease US who are showing sympathy for Palestine and the boiling anti-US sentiment in the Saudi Arabia world, analysts said, noting that Joe Biden wants to show that he is capable of managing the whole situation, while the reality tells the opposite.The past week witnessed an embarrassing moment for the US as Secretary of State Antony Blinken issued one of the Joe Biden administration's strongest warnings to Israel in a blunt call to pause military operations in Gaza to allow for the immediate and increased delivery of aid during his visit to Israel, while Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel would be ""going full steam ahead.""The US is losing ground in the Middle East. While there is a bipartisan consensus to support Israel, Diao pointed out that there are differences between the Democratic and Republican parties toward the country. The Netanyahu administration will not submit to the US as it is aware of this division and is using it to gain leverage in dealings with the US.On the heels of Blinken's visit, the director of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), William Burns arrived in Israel on Sunday, the latest in the Joe Biden administration's push to engage with key parties to bring about a humanitarian pause while Israel continued its ground offensive in Gaza, with the death toll there approaching 10,000, according to media reports. Analysts noted that the Joe Biden administration's predicament in the Palestine-Israel war highlighted US' failure in its Middle East strategy, and with a worsening humanitarian crisis unfolding before the eyes of the international community, the US' credibility as well as the values it touts are futher shattered, the analysts said.",CHINA,POLITICS,"Protesters gather while holding flags and signs during the pro-Palestinian demonstration at Freedom Plaza in Washington, DC Photo: VCG",Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'Joe Biden': ('PER', 8), 'Donald Trump': ('PER', 2), 'Diao Daming': ('PER', 2), 'Zheng': ('PER', 1), 'Israel': ('LOC', 5), 'US': ('LOC', 9), 'Saudi Arabia US': ('LOC', 12), 'Middle East': ('LOC', 1), 'Saudi Arabia': ('LOC', 1), 'Arizona': ('LOC', 1), 'Beijing': ('LOC', 1), 'China': ('LOC', 1), 'Palestine': ('LOC', 1), 'Palestine - Israel': ('MISC', 2), 'Muslims': ('MISC', 2), 'Muslim': ('MISC', 1), 'Jewish': ('MISC', 1), 'New York Times': ('ORG', 1), 'US Institute': ('ORG', 2), 'Renmin University of China': ('ORG', 1), 'Global Times': ('ORG', 1), 'Yuan': ('ORG', 2), 'Academy': ('ORG', 1), 'Social Sciences': ('ORG', 1), 'Joe B': ('ORG', 2)}"
386,Spillovers of Palestine-Israel conflict could be very serious,Jin Liangxiang,2023-11-06,"The conflict between Israel and Palestine has been ongoing for over a month, and a serious humanitarian crisis has already occurred. While global focus is on the ongoing conflict, the potential challenges of the spillovers have not been sufficiently noted. Judging by the very dangerous prospect of the spillovers, it is expected that parties at stake need to take substantial actions to de-escalate tensions.The first spillover, which actually has already taken place, involves sub-state actors. Last month saw occasional exchanges of fire between Israel and the US on one side and sub-state actors including Hezbollah of Lebanon and Houthis of Yemen and various armed groups in Iraq. And the involvement of sub-state actors suggested that spillover had already taken place. And with the situation in Gaza becoming worse, this category of spillover could even grow, which would create more uncertainties in the region.The second spillover, which also has already taken place, was the significant tensions between Saudi Arabia countries and Israel. In recent years, there has been a warming of relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia countries, reflecting the region's desire for détente and peace. That might also be the reason for Saudi Arabia countries adopting a passive rather than an active approach toward the recent Israel-Palestine conflict.However, the people of Saudi Arabia countries still strongly identify with the legitimate cause of the Palestine' aspiration for a nation, which puts a significant amount of pressure on the governments of Saudi Arabia countries. The Palestine issue remains politically relevant for Saudi Arabia countries. With tensions growing, they will face more and more pressure from within.Last week, Jordan recalled its ambassador to Israel, and refused to allow the Israel ambassador to return. Bahrain announced on November 2 that it had recalled its ambassador from Israel and suspended economic ties with Israel. These initial responses could be seen as signals from Saudi Arabia countries. If the situation continues to deteriorate, it is quite possible that more Saudi Arabia countries will take similar diplomatic and economic actions, which could lead to a regional boycott against Israel.The third spillover could be the growth of anti-West radical elements. The lack of justice regarding the Palestine issue is a manifestation of the humiliation imposed by the West on the Islamic World. The continuation of behaviors that seriously undermine human rights in Gaza and other parts of Palestine could trigger another round of anti-West movements not only in the Middle East but also worldwide. One of the clearest messages expressed in 1998 by Osama Bin Laden, the founder of Al Qaeda, was that they were opposing the humiliation of Palestine resulting from the occupation.If the humanitarian disasters continue, sympathizers of Palestine will expectedly become more emotional. The future could likely see EU countries facing more radical elements as they have a high proportion of Muslims and sympathizers of Palestine. The fourth could be a geopolitical campaign among major global actors. There is no question that the Palestine issue is one that justice is absent by nature as a result of power politics and hegemony. Any efforts to reconstruct the truth cannot hide the reality. Without justice, peace can never be available. Unfortunately, it seems that the Joe Biden administration and US decision-makers do not have any intention to think twice about their unreasonable policy. It is even worse that the Joe Biden administration is using the hot topic for its own global geopolitical ambitions. In October, he submitted a $100 billion supplemental request to Congress, with $61 billion, more than half, actually going to Ukraine. With such a package, Joe Biden saw a high chance that the request would be passed by Congress as they are always ready to pass resolutions to assist Israel. Linking the Palestine-Israel conflict to global politics will make the issue really spill over to become a global campaign for geopolitical interests. In one word, it seems the US and the West in general are both blind and immune to the humanitarian crisis in Palestine. Their intentional ignorance of the severity of the spillovers would seriously undermine global security in many ways. While preparing for the worst, global efforts for peace should be united in resisting against any unreasonable policy. Those in favor of peace will have to make every effort to put pressure on the US, urging the US to stop Israel. The author is senior research fellow with Shanghai Institutes for International Studies. opinion@Global Times.com.cn",OPINION,VIEWPOINT,Free at last Image: Liu Rui/GT,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'Israel': ('LOC', 10), 'Palestine': ('LOC', 6), 'US': ('LOC', 1), 'Lebanon': ('LOC', 1), 'Yemen': ('LOC', 1), 'Iraq': ('LOC', 1), 'Gaza': ('LOC', 2), 'Saudi Arabia': ('LOC', 8), 'Jordan': ('LOC', 1), 'Bahrain': ('LOC', 1), 'West': ('LOC', 3), 'World': ('LOC', 1), 'Middle East': ('LOC', 1), 'Hezbollah': ('ORG', 1), 'Houthis': ('ORG', 1), 'Saudi': ('MISC', 1), 'Islamic': ('MISC', 1)}"
387,‘Two-state solution’ is the only way out as humanitarian crisis in Gaza exacerbates,Global Times,2023-11-05,"The humanitarian crisis in Gaza is exacerbating. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has made four visits to Israel since October 7, but what he talked about was the US support for Israel instead of a ceasefire.With each day that a ceasefire is delayed, Palestine' animosity toward Israel deepens. It will definitely create a longer-term and more devastating disaster in the region already plagued by decades of war.When the conflict between Palestine and Israel first broke out, China immediately expressed its stance, emphasizing that the top priority is to prevent a broader humanitarian disaster and that the fundamental way out is to implement the ""two-state solution."" On many occasions since then, China has repeatedly stressed the importance and urgency of returning to the ""two-state solution.""However, the US and EU countries have not actively responded to this call of conscience. Instead, they have been constrained by domestic politics and wavered, preventing major countries from  reaching an immediate consensus.It was not until Israel's military operations in Gaza had caused tens of thousands of casualties, including scores of women and children, and displaced hundreds of thousands of people that leaders in the US and EU countries seemed to realize the need to return to the two-state solution. US President Joe Biden and some EU leaders have expressed their stance on this recently.Although the current suffering in the Middle East is not directly caused by the US and EU, as countries deeply involved in the geopolitical game there since World War II, they bear a heavy responsibility for the resumption of the war.It is precisely because of the US' unlimited support for Israel and the cowardice of the US and EU that led to the failure to take action to maintain peace. Israel marched into Gaza without any scruples, carrying US-made weapons and equipment. So far, the US has not called for shifting the focus to a ceasefire. Instead, it supported Israel's retaliatory strikes against Gaza and enhanced the deployment of force to restrain the involvement of other forces in the Middle East. What is shocking is that some senior US officials are still questioning the Palestine death toll; some US media outlets said that China's proposal of the two-state solution is an ""empty slogan""; some US scholars have even publicly declared that the two-state solution is dead.On November 29, 1947, the UN General Assembly passed Resolution 181 calling for the establishment of an Saudi Arabia state and a Jewish state.After the 1967 War, Israel occupied Jerusalem, the West Bank and the Gaza, which was equivalent to taking all the land assigned to Palestine by the UN as its own.Since the 1990s, the two-state solution has become the national policy of the US government in promoting Israel-Palestine peace talks. It has also become the official position of most countries that have diplomatic relations with Israel on the Israel-Palestine issue.The reason why the two-state solution had its ups and downs and could not be truly implemented has a lot to do with the different interests of all parties involved. An article in the Foreign Policy magazine on October 19 stated that little more than lip service has been paid to this goal by the US, and with each passing crisis, Washington grows more and more aligned with Israel. Although the future arrangement of the two-state solution still requires arduous negotiations, establishing two countries and ensuring that each one can operate stably and live in peace is the only goal that can promote negotiations between the two parties. The international community cannot give up on this goal, especially at a time when the war is rekindling.The challenge now is whether the international community can reach a consensus on this and form the basis for a ceasefire by prompting the two sides to restart negotiations. As for the modification and adjustment of the two-state solution, that is a matter for negotiation in the next step.As it stands, there is no solution to the crisis in Gaza, except the two-state solution. Any attempt to oppose or delay this plan for whatever reason will delay peace, perpetuate hatred and add fuel to the fire.If the Joe Biden administration is still wavering on this issue and cannot make a decision, what awaits the US is likely a disaster.",OPINION,OBSERVER,"People gather around an ambulance after an Israeli warplane attacked ambulances at a gate of the Al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza City on Nov. 3, 2023.

388,"US ‘slight change’ in attitude on Palestine-Israel conflict due to rising domestic, international pressure, ‘but unable to stop Gaza bloodshed immediately’",Yang Sheng,2023-11-05,"
US Secretary of State Antony Blinken Photo: AFPThe attitude of the White House toward the Palestine-Israel conflict has seen a slight change in recent days compared to its firm stance to merely defend Israel's ""right of self-defense"" at the very beginning, as Washington now calls for ""humanitarian pauses,"" China analysts said on Sunday. They noted that although this comes as a result of mounting pressure from US voters and the international community, this kind of adjustment shows limited sincerity and effectiveness in being able to stop the horrific crisis which has already killed at least 9,500 people in Gaza. Tens of thousands of protesters who support Palestine and oppose Israel's military operations in Gaza marched through downtown Washington, DC on Saturday in what organizers hoped was the largest US demonstration of its kind since this round of the conflict started in early October, media reported.Protesters carried placards with slogans such as ""Palestine Lives Matter,"" ""Let Gaza Live"" and ""Their blood is on your hands."" Protesters chanted ""Joe Biden, Joe Biden, you can't hide; we charge you with genocide,"" as the US government continued to reject demands to add its voice to calls for a blanket cease-fire, media reported. Before the protest, Washington has made slight adjustments in its tone. US President Joe Biden said he thought there should be a humanitarian ""pause"" in the Israel-Hamas war, after his campaign speech Wednesday evening was interrupted by a protester calling for a cease-fire. ""I think we need a pause,"" Joe Biden said, AP reported on Thursday.During his latest visit in Jordan, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken reaffirmed Washington's position calling for ""humanitarian pauses"" in Gaza to protect civilians and allow foreign nationals to leave, Aljazeera reported on Saturday. At the beginning of this round of the conflict, the US completely supported Israel to exercise its ""right of self-defense,"" but after thousands of Palestine civilians have been killed and even UN personnel, journalists, hospitals and refugee camps have been struck, Washington has been forced to adjust, in order to respond to pressures from the international community and US voters, and to prevent Saudi Arabia countries like Jordan and Egypt from aligning themselves with Iran and Turkey, Sun Degang, director of the Center for Middle Eastern Studies at Fudan University, told the Global Times on Sunday. According to the latest death toll on Saturday, Israel bombardments in the Gaza have killed at least 9,500 people, with well over half women and children, the government media office in the Gaza announced on Saturday, media reported.More than 40 percent of the dead in Gaza after nearly four weeks of war were children, the UN said, with 3,900 reported child victims, and another 1,250 missing and presumed buried under bombed buildings, the Guardian reported.""The death toll in result of the Israel aggression on the Gaza since October 7 is 9,500, including 3,900 children and 2,509 women,"" Salama Marouf, head of the Gaza media office, told a press conference.Although the death toll in Gaza is rising sharply day by day, the adjustment by the US is driven by its demand to preserve its global hegemony, and the Joe Biden administration will not stop military and economic assistance to Israel. Its promise of protecting Israel will also not change, and these are key conditions for Israel to continue its operation in Gaza and ignore international pressures, analysts said. Ma Xiaolin, senior professor and dean of the Institute for Studies on the Mediterranean Rim at Zhejiang International Studies University, told the Global Times on Sunday that the ""humanitarian pauses"" recently mentioned by Joe Biden and Blinken is a term that the US is using to replace ""cease-fire"" or ""humanitarian truce,"" a position between supporting Israel to continue its war in Gaza and responding to international calls for a cease-fire. The US does not want to be isolated by international community with Israel, Ma added. China analysts said the most sincere and effective way to realize an effective and sustainable cease-fire and stop the horrific bloodshed in Gaza is to let the UN pass a resolution calling for a cease-fire, and not to one-sidedly stand for Israel and defend Israel's killing of Palestine civilians in Gaza. Unfortunately, this is not what the US wants. According to the Times of Israel, Saudi Arabia leaders decrying the mounting civilian death toll in the conflict pushed for an immediate cease-fire Saturday, but Blinken warned that ""such a move would be counterproductive and could encourage more violence by the terror group,"" referring to Hamas. US solution unreliableBlinken made an unannounced visit to the occupied West Bank on Sunday and met with the Palestine Authority President Mahmoud Abbas on his second visit to the region since the outbreak of latest round of conflict, Reuters reported.During the meeting, Abbas told Blinken ""there must be an immediate cease-fire to the war in Gaza,"" according to Abbas' spokesperson, adding to a growing chorus of Saudi Arabia leaders stressing the need for a truce, Al Jazeera reported on Sunday, saying that the meeting between them lasted less than an hour. There were no statements at the end of the meeting from either party.According to the Times of Israel on Saturday, earlier this week, Blinken told a congressional hearing, ""At some point, what would make the most sense would be for an effective and revitalized Palestine Authority to have governance and ultimately security responsibility for Gaza."" Blinken will discuss this idea with Abbas.However, Ramallah, for its part, has asserted it has no interest in returning to Gaza unless it is part of a diplomatic initiative that unites the enclave with the West Bank and revamps the peace process with Israel, an idea that would be supported by the Joe Biden administration but has little backing in the current Israel government, Israel media said.China analysts said the US diplomatic efforts are unlikely to be effective in to stopping casualties and will also fail to convince Saudi Arabia countries, including the Palestine Authority because a ""pause"" is not a ""cease-fire,"" and the US and Israel both prioritize ""eliminating Hamas,"" rather than to avoiding killing civilians.The US and Israel also want to differentiate Hamas from Palestine, by calling the conflict the ""Israel-Hamas war,"" but this approach will not work, particularly as Gaza is also a part of Palestine's occupied territory, and Hamas is part of the military strength of Palestine as a whole, Ma said, noting that Gaza belongs to the Palestine people from both Gaza and the West Bank, and now that nearly 10,000 Palestine are dead, it is not just a war between Israel and Hamas, but another round of the Palestine-Israel conflict.With this insincere attitude and unrealistic approach, the US' solution for the Palestine-Israel conflict is unlikely to succeed, experts noted.Impact to US election 2024The Guardian reported that signs of a split between traditional, pro-Israel Democratic party supporters and younger voters, including Saudi Arabia US, over the Israel-Palestine conflict were made apparent in a speech by Nihad Awad, the national director at the Council on US-Islamic Relations.""The language that President Joe Biden and his party understand is the language of votes… and our message is: No cease-fire, no votes,"" Awad said, listing states that next year's presidential election could turn on. ""No votes in Michigan, no votes in Arizona, no votes in Georgia, no votes in Nevada, no votes in Wisconsin, no votes in Pennsylvania.""Although the poor handling of the Palestine-Israel conflict has caused a drop in Joe Biden's approval rating, to what extent this will impact the presidential election next year is in question, Lü Xiang, a research fellow at the China Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times on Sunday.Progressive forces, left-wingers and Muslim voters will be angry at Joe Biden, but considering Donald Trump and his supporters are much more extreme in supporting Israel, letting Donald Trump win will absolutely not serve their demand of calling for the US to help Palestine. This is why Joe Biden is not very concerned about the protests at the moment as he believes they will vote for him eventually, Lü said.There is a year to go before voters go to the polls in November next year, and the war in Gaza might not last for that long, so the impact might be limited, said analysts. But some analysts also consider that if some Joe Biden supporters choose not to vote, it might impact the situation in some swing states.",CHINA,DIPLOMACY,"Demonstrators gather in front of the White House during a rally in support of Palestinians in Washington, DC, on November 4, 2023.

390,US elites' efforts to ossify Chinese society will fail,Hu Xijin,2023-11-04,"It is becoming clearer and clearer that the US wants to construct an oppressive, cold relationship with China, and to obstruct China's development while trying to avoid a severe clash. Breaking such a US strategic scheme will be a truly long-term and significant challenge for China.US Secretary of State Antony Blinken kicked off another trip to Asia on Friday, traveling to Israel and then to Tokyo for the G7 foreign ministers' meeting and making stops in South Korea and India. It demonstrates the US' ""enduring commitment to and focus on the Indo-Pacific, even amidst other global challenges,"" said Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs Daniel Kritenbrink on Thursday.Also on Thursday, US Secretary of the Treasury Janet Yellen asserted that the US economic relationship with China must consider human rights and national security. She said Washington was not seeking to ""decouple"" from China, but wanted to diversify by investing domestically and strengthening ties with ""trusted countries"" in Asia. ""We've put forward a vision of the world grounded in values we share with these allies and partners,"" Yellen added, while also mentioning the need for a ""healthy and stable economic relationship"" between the US and China.""When we take national security actions using economic tools, we do so in narrowly targeted ways, such as with President Joe Biden's executive order on outbound investments, aimed at accomplishing our national security goals, not choking off growth in China,"" she said.China and the US face decades of highly strategic and complex games. The US has the advantage of being at the top of the technological ladder and having almost the entire developed world as allies, as well as a strong pull for some of China's neighboring countries.There is a risk of military friction between China and the US, but with the overall strengthening of China's military power, especially the expansion of its nuclear arsenal, Washington is increasingly fearful of a large-scale military conflict with China. It should be said that China will certainly ensure its own military security. As long as we continue to strengthen our military build-up and maintain a robust national defense strategy, China's national security is guaranteed militarily, and the US clearly lacks the vision to overwhelm China in this regard.The suspense between China and the US is based on whether the US can shut down the engine of China's economy. The US elites are hoping for this, and they are also very enthusiastic about ""decoupling"" in terms of high-tech sectors and trade diversification. However, they are deeply uncertain about whether these measures will work, so there are many pessimists.The reason is that China is a unique country that has strong leadership from the Communist Party of China and is very mobilized and cohesive. The US has sanctioned many countries, which has led to problems in those countries, such as currency devaluation, and this can easily create a series of other problems. But China's situation is very different: Its economic size is close to that of the US and its GDP in purchasing power parity terms is even higher. Therefore, the US cannot achieve its goals to impact China seriously through economic sanctions and market shifts.The US has tried all the tricks it has, including a trade war with China, raised tariffs and a comprehensive embargo on high technology products. But China as a whole still stands firm. China's economy has seen a sight slowdown, but the biggest reasons are issues such as the COVID-19 epidemic, the real-estate bubble and the overall weak demand in the international market. It is hard to say how much this is related to the implementation of the US' strategy against China.However, apart from trying to stifle China's economy, the US can do nothing more. Some US elites surely think, how about a ""color revolution""? However, due to the meticulousness of the China system, that would be almost impossible.Therefore, China's economic and social development in the long term is the focus of the future struggle between China and the US. What needs to be pointed out is that China's future development mainly depends on the China people, and the US can only play an ""exogenous"" role. China's economy has huge potential. The US cannot take this away; it is very afraid of it and deeply resigned to it. What Washington can do is intimidate, interfere, create trouble, and set various traps.This is actually China's greatest strategic advantage. Instead of messing things up due to external interference from the US or being subject to its constraints, we should keep strategic determination, focus on doing our own thing and promote China's development in all spheres resolutely in accordance with the laws of economic and social development. As long as we can do that, the US will not be able to hijack the general strategic trend. It seems that the US has many pawns in Asia and all over the world and together they can be powerful. But in fact, the China people have the initiative in the China-US game. This is because as long as China continues to develop and grow, the US' strategy of containing China will change on its own, and it will collapse gradually until it's gone.Some US elites would like to see China make efforts to deal with Washington's strategic attack, and for national security to become the central theme of China's internal affairs. They want to see our society gradually lose resilience and for the grass-roots level of our society to lose considerable freedom. They want to see the general environment of the market economy severely deformed. This is just wishful thinking. The most important thing in the struggle against the US is to figure out where the main battlefield is so that the US elites' attempt to ossify China society will fail completely. I suggest that China people use the reality of our society's vitality and vigor to hit Washington hard in its face and send those US extreme elites who arrogantly want to fight a ""new cold war"" with China into despair.The author is a media professional. opinion@globaltimes.com.cn",OPINION,VIEWPOINT,Illustration: Liu Rui/GT,Global Times commentator,Hu Xijin is the former editor-in-chief of the Global Times.

391,"Israel’s blunt rejection of US call for pause reflects failed US strategy, as anger fuels with Washington’s excessive leniency",Fan Anqi,2023-11-04,"The swift rejection by Israel of US Secretary of State Antony Blinken's call for a humanitarian pause in Gaza has been seen as a reflection of the diminishing influence of the US in the Middle East and the failure of its global governance, experts said on Saturday, as anger mounts with the US launching of a military exercise in the Mediterranean, which could further inflame tensions in the region.Arriving in Tel Aviv for the fourth time in a month and reiterating continued support for Israel, Blinken issued one of the Joe Biden administration's strongest warnings to Israel in a blunt call to pause military operations in Gaza to allow for the immediate and increased delivery of aid.However, the call was rebuffed by Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu only a few minutes later, who said Israel would be ""going with full steam ahead.""The embarrassing moment came as Israel announced its troops have encircled Gaza, and its offensive involving air strikes and ground forces by far killing more than 9,200 people, among whom some 3,800 were children, media reports said.Despite Israel's outright refusal of Blinken's appeals, the US is showing its support by holding a three-day drill in the Eastern Mediterranean, deploying two US aircraft carriers in the area for the first time in decades, joined with more than 11,000 personnel, US 6th fleet announced on Friday.It ""sends a clear signal about our commitment to deter aggression and promote stability throughout the region,"" said Thomas Ishee, commander of the fleet.The US finds itself in a predicament where it is excessively accommodating toward Israel, primarily due to the overwhelming influence of the Jewish community on US' domestic politics. ""This has led to a lack of principle in the US' Middle East policy, resulting in the consequence that Israel is essentially leading the US rather than the other way around,"" Tian Wenlin, a professor at School of International Studies of the Renmin University of China, told the Global Times on Saturday.Furthermore, Israel's outright refusal demonstrated the diminishing influence and a collapsing credibility of the US, ranging from its failure to persuade Saudi Arabia to raise oil prices to the situation of now.Experts further noted that with the limitless support for Israel, the US is burying its Middle East policy as well as its global strategy.""Washington is caught between the need to support Israel and the desire to gain favor from the Saudi Arabia world. And now, with its excessive leniency toward Israel, a growing distance is seen between the US and its Saudi Arabia allies, who are well aware that Israel's ability to act with impunity is primarily due to US support. In other words, the US has offended the entire Islamic world for the sake of Israel,"" Tian said.From a global perspective, the US is also losing ground on a moral front, given it has long championed itself as having values based foreign policy. Now with the blatant display of a double standard, the US has undermined its own credibility, the expert said.Furthermore, from a geopolitical perspective, the US' involvement in the Palestinian-Israeli Conflict conflict is affecting its global strategy, either in its support for Ukraine in the Russia-Ukraine conflict, or efforts to contain China in the Asia-Pacific region, observers said.The US' fanning of flames in the Middle East that is already on the brink of collapse has fueled the anger and chaos within America, as seen in the Port of Oakland when hundreds of protesters blocked a US military supply ship from leaving on Friday by locking themselves to the vessel, as the ship was bound to aid Israel after being loaded with weapons and military equipment, according to CBS News.An ever-deepening rift is not only happening between the public and elected officials, but within the government too. CNN called the House' Israel aid drama ""the latest failure of US governance,"" as the House struggles with a vote to send $14 billion in emergency aid to Israel, which ""leaves America looking like a divided superpower unable even to rush help to a friend that believes it's fighting an existential war,"" reported CNN on Thursday.Across the world, many more have raised their voice and condemned the killing of civilians in the war. Soon after Blinken announced to add Turkey to his Middle East trip following Israel,  Ankara said Saturday it was recalling its ambassador to Israel and breaking off contacts with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in protest at the bloodshed in Gaza.Honduras' Foreign Affairs Minister announced on Friday the recall of its ambassador to Israel in light of ""the serious humanitarian situation the civilian Palestine population is suffering in the Gaza.""Honduras became the latest Latin US country to take diplomatic actions against Israel following Bolivia, Chile and Columbia.UN experts warned on Thursday that ""time is running out"" to prevent genocide and humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza, expressing deep frustration with Israel's refusal to halt plans to decimate the besieged Gaza.",CHINA,DIPLOMACY,Antony Blinken Photo:AFP,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'Israel': ('LOC', 12), 'US': ('LOC', 12), 'Gaza': ('LOC', 3), 'Middle East': ('LOC', 3), 'Tel Aviv': ('LOC', 1), 'Eastern Mediterranean': ('LOC', 2), 'China': ('LOC', 1), 'Arabia': ('LOC', 2), 'Washington': ('LOC', 1), 'Antony Blinken': ('PER', 3), 'Joe Biden': ('PER', 1), 'Benjamin Netanyahu': ('PER', 1), 'Thomas Ishee': ('PER', 1), 'Jewish': ('MISC', 1), 'Saudi': ('MISC', 2)}"
392,Fumio Kishida's 'gift packs' for Southeast Asia are ominous: Global Times editorial,Global Times,2023-11-03,"Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida will visit the Philippines and Malaysia from November 3 to 5. This is his first visit to these two Southeast Asian countries since taking office as the prime minister. The ""gift packs"" he will take with him were revealed in advance by the Japanese media. Unlike previous Japanese prime ministers' visits that often focused on promoting economic diplomacy, this time the ""gift packs"" mainly contained ""lethal weapons,"" which not only appear ominous but also strongly suggest that Kishida's trip will be a ""troublemaking journey.""According to reports from multiple Japanese media outlets, Kishida's visit is primarily focused on strengthening defense and security cooperation with the Philippines and Malaysia. It is worth noting that Japan will, for the first time, provide the Philippines with coastal surveillance radar under Japan's Official Security Assistance (OSA) mechanism approved in April. Malaysia, which has traditionally emphasized cooperation with China, has kept certain vigilance, with reports suggesting that discussions have been progressing slowly, and Kishida would likely explain it to Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim and attempt to gain his support for the initiative. It is evident that the Philippines is the main target of Japan's breakthrough in this visit, and public attention is also more focused on defense cooperation between Japan and the Philippines.According to Japan's design, the OSA aims to provide defense equipment to the armed forces of the so-called ""like-minded"" countries, which, in simpler terms, is military assistance. It is distinct from Japan's previous emphasis on the Official Development Assistance (ODA) in its diplomacy. Although it differs by only one letter, it represents a significant shift in nature. Moving from the ODA, which had a character of atonement for World War II and was focused on helping improve the livelihoods of recipient countries and enhancing economic and trade relations, to the militarily-oriented OSA signifies that Japanese diplomacy, and even Japan's national character, has crossed a threshold set by Japan's Peace Constitution.In fact, both the establishment and utilization of the OSA mechanism and Kishida's ""troublemaking journey"" are not isolated singular events. They are manifestations of the regional impact of Japan's national security strategy transformation represented by the three strategic documents at the end of last year. In its new national security strategy, Japan positions China as an ""unprecedented and greatest strategic challenge"" and seeks to jointly deal with it with allies and ""like-minded countries."" The OSA is a tool to implement Japan's strategic vision.It can be said that Tokyo has been searching for suitable partners to implement the OSA mechanism, and the Philippines is one of its preferred targets. Since this year, Japan has strengthened its security cooperation with the Philippines through military exercises, dialogues, and other means. The Philippines has also shown interest in the ""Indo-Pacific Strategy,"" particularly the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue. Now, with the US preoccupied with the Ukraine crisis and the Israel-Palestine conflict, Japan believes it must take over the baton from the US and support the Philippines in its adventurous actions in the South China Sea in various forms. It is not ruled out that Japan may even take more active and forceful measures to ""support the Philippines"" in the future, which has become one of the factors influencing whether the situation in the South China Sea will continue to escalate.Manila should understand that Kishida's ""gift packs"" may be flashy, but it is not free, and it comes with a high cost. Let's take a look at how the former chief of staff, joint staff, Japan Self-Defense Forces (SDF), Katsutoshi Kawano, ""envisioned"" future defense cooperation between Japan and the Philippines: Japan's military aid to the Philippines will expand step by step and will change to include lethal weapons such as anti-ship missiles; Manila, in turn, could give Japan access to its military bases, as it does with the US, allowing Japanese SDF aircraft to patrol the South China Sea. If such a scenario were to occur, it would undoubtedly be a nightmare for Manila's sovereignty and security.Former Japanese prime minister Takeo Fukuda proposed the basic principle of Japan's foreign policy toward Southeast Asia, known as ""Fukuda Doctrine"" in Manila in 1977, which emphasized that Japan would not become a military power and would contribute to peace and prosperity in Southeast Asia and the world. It was widely welcomed by Southeast Asian countries. When ASEAN upgraded its relationship with Japan to a ""Comprehensive Strategic Partnership"" in September of this year, Singapore's Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong expressed hope for stronger cooperation between the two sides in areas such as cybersecurity and the digital economy, climate change and green economy, and connectivity. What Southeast Asian countries need and expect has always been clear. Any actions that provoke regional tensions under the guise of ""security"" are unwelcome, and Japan, which desires to become a ""normal country,"" will only become more abnormal due to these moves.",OPINION,EDITORIAL,"Japan's Prime Minister Fumio Kishida speaks during a news conference at the prime minister's official residence in Tokyo on November 2, 2023.

399,Behold! Uncle Sam is coming to ‘rescue!’,Xin Ping,2023-11-03,"The latest round of the Palestinian-Israeli Conflict conflict has been going on for over 20 days. While the bombardment is continuing, the crisis seems set to spill over into neighboring countries and probably the whole Middle East region. At a time when the majority of the international community is condemning the violence against civilians, the behavior of the US seems quite peculiar. Instead of calling for an immediate ceasefire, it is not only sending more munitions to this land under fire, but also standing in the way toward a complete and fundamental solution to a problem that has been dragging on for decades. As in most cases, when Uncle Sam shouts out ""The US is coming to rescue!"" things are usually getting worse, and a fair and equitable path forward is out of the question.On the second day after Hamas launched a surprise attack on Israel, the White House immediately approved military aid to its ally and dispatched the first batch of military equipment the day after Israel began its revenge. Two USS carrier strike groups were quickly assembled in the eastern Mediterranean to strengthen military deterrence. A fortnight after the outbreak of the conflict, the Joe Biden administration proposed to the Congress for military aid to Israel worth $14.3 billion.With the ammunition provided by Uncle Sam, Israel was able to carry out days of airstrikes all across the Gaza and a possible massive ground operation. With the ""ironclad"" support from the US, the Israel Defense Forces has the guts to set fire indiscriminately to residential buildings and public facilities, including hospitals, costing thousands of lives, most of whom are elders, women and children, the most vulnerable of society.Under the grandiose excuse of the so-called commitments to its close allies, what Uncle Sam has done with his partners has no difference from mafia gangs, i.e. to kill, to set fire, to violate the basic human conscience.When those US politicians condemned Hamas' acts and screamed ""Finish them!"" they should have known that excessive defense could also constitute a crime and there is never any justification for disproportionate acts of revenge, let alone that these acts could cause humanitarian disaster, like the siege of Gaza.Seeing from the lens of ""double standard,"" the US always enjoys its supremacy over other nations and peoples. Uncle Sam and his friends use their supremacy to run roughshod over international law. There is no need for Israel self-defense to meet the conditions of necessity and proportionality, nor any need to comply with international humanitarian law. In their own opinion, the bombardment causing large casualties in Gaza never constitutes a war crime. Nor does the Gaza siege, the displacement of such a large number of civilians, and the reckless use of white phosphorus munitions against the unarmed people of Gaza constitute crimes against humanity. They mustn't forget that the Palestine people, whose homeland has been under Israel occupation for a long time, have every reason and right to live in equal peace. This is exactly the ""despicable form"" unfolding before the world right now.When the majority of the world is about to act collectively and stop the calamity that is completely out of line with modern society, it is Uncle Sam, once again, who stepped out of rank and voted against two UN resolutions calling for a temporary ceasefire between Palestine and Israel. Both resolutions asked for the respect of the human rights of the people in Gaza and both were dismissed by the country which always claims to care about ""human rights status"" around the globe.For the US, the region of the Middle East is always a leverage for its own geopolitical interests and a good market for its arms dealers. In a nutshell, when Uncle Sam comes to the rescue, it is his own interests rather than the lives of local people that he really wants to save. For the sake of the former, he can't be too ready to sacrifice the latter.The author is a commentator on international affairs, writing regularly for Xinhua News, Global Times, China Daily, CGTN, etc. He can be reached at Xinping604@gmail.com.",OPINION,VIEWPOINT,Fueling tension.

400,Xi-Scholz talk highlights pragmatic cooperation,GT staff reporters,2023-11-03,"China President Xi Jinping on Friday held a video meeting with Germany Chancellor Olaf Scholz, during which he noted that China and Germany, both responsible major countries, should not only develop bilateral relations and serve as examples of win-win cooperation, but also defend the international order and multilateralism, and work together to address global challenges. Noting China-Germany relations have entered the second 50 years, Xi Jinping said that China and Germany, as all-round strategic partners, had worked together in the spirit of mutual benefit and grown together in the spirit of mutual learning and exchange.""This is the valuable experience of the smooth development of China-Germany relations over the past decades, which should be cherished and passed on by both sides,"" Xi Jinping said, describing China-Germany cooperation as open and pragmatic, which has been continuously enriched and developed.He said that more than 130 Germany companies will participate in the sixth China International Import Expo, which has shown the confidence of Germany companies in China's development.It is hoped that the Germany side will also adhere to a high level of openness toward China enterprises seeking cooperation opportunities in Germany, Xi Jinping said.The same day, Xi Jinping met with visiting Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis in Beijing. Hailing the past half century, during which the relationship between China and Greece has always been healthy and constantly renewed, Xi Jinping expressed willingness to enhance bilateral cooperation on a wide range of sectors. China is willing to work together with the EU to maintain correct mutual understanding, focus on consensus, and grasp the direction, in order to fully activate mutually beneficial cooperation in all fields. ""We hope that Greece will continue to play a constructive role in this regard,"" Xi Jinping said. The meetings and frequent China-EU interactions, have well demonstrated that China attaches great importance to the EU relationship, and this has not changed. We want to continue the momentum of bilateral stabilization and warming up, Cui Hongjian, a professor with the Academy of Regional and Global Governance with the Beijing Foreign Studies University, told the Global Times on Friday. Cui also mentioned Germany's overall opposition to the EU's so-called anti-subsidy probe into China electric vehicles, which also jeopardizes Germany, as the two countries are cooperating closely in this field. Germany is reasonably expressing the hope of enhancing trade cooperation, and judging from recent interactions between China and EU, both sides not only want to maintain a stable bilateral relationship, but also seek more cooperation on the basis of stability. Cui interpreted this as expanding and accumulating positivity in China-EU relations, which can offset the negative factors. Scholz introduced the views of the Germany side on the Palestinian-Israeli Conflict and the Ukraine crisis, and expressed the hope to keep close communication with China.

Xi Jinping pointed out that to solve the Palestinian-Israeli Conflict and the Ukraine crisis, it is necessary to think more deeply about security issues, adhere to the vision of common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security, and promote the building of a balanced, effective and sustainable security architecture.Squeezing the security space of other countries and supporting one side while ignoring the legitimate demands of the other side will lead to regional imbalance and the expansion and escalation of conflicts, said Xi Jinping.He said both China and the EU side should work together to mediate conflicts, ease tensions and play a positive role in promoting regional peace and development. In terms of the Israel-Palestine and Russia-Ukraine conflicts, experts said Germany hopes that China can play a bigger and positive role in regional and global security, but the US wants to take advantage of the two crises while the EU is directly suffering.",CHINA,DIPLOMACY,"Chinese President Xi Jinping meets with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz via video link on Nov 3, 2023.

401,US criticized for hypocrisy of seeking 'pause' amid worsening humanitarian crisis in Gaza,GT staff reporters,2023-11-03,"As US Secretary of State Antony Blinken started his trip to Israel on Friday, the US has been urged to push for a ceasefire rather than using a ""pause"" to buy more time for Israel's ground operations in the Gaza, which will result in more casualties. Analysts said that with more catastrophic humanitarian crises occurring, the US bears the responsibility for the bloodshed in Gaza.Blinken landed in Israel on Friday, the second trip in a month, to meet Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu after the Hamas attack on October 7. Before his departure to the Middle East, Blinken told reporters that he would discuss concrete steps to ""minimize harm"" to civilians in Gaza and call for localized pauses in fighting to allow humanitarian aid into the region, media reported. International criticism and pressure on the US have been mounting due to the increasing death toll in Gaza, and if it does nothing, it will be standing on the opposite site of humanity and the international community, which is why Blinken aims to push for a ""humanitarian pause"" during this trip, Niu Xinchun, a research fellow at the China Institute of Contemporary International Relations, told the Global Times. Israel may agree with the ""pause"" suggestion as it would be temporary and restricted to certain spots, for example, to allow humanitarian aid to enter Gaza and foreigners to leave through the Rafah crossing, Niu said. However, the humanitarian crisis will continue to deteriorate as Israel is in the early stage of pushing its ground military operation into Gaza and the US' policy of supporting Israel to eliminate Hamas has not changed. More people will die and the situation will worsen, said the expert. Israel Prime Minister Netanyahu said on Thursday night that Israel forces were at the ""height of the battle."" On the same day, Israel military spokesperson Daniel Hagari said that Gaza has been encircled nearly a week after its forces expanded ground operations in the Hamas-governed enclave. Hagari also said a ""ceasefire is not currently on the table at all,"" Al Jazeera reported. Opposing calls from the global community, including the Saudi Arabia world and some EU countries, the US still refuses to push a ceasefire, saying that Hamas would use a truce to regroup. According to the latest figures from the Hamas Health Ministry in Gaza, across the Gaza more than 9,000 have been killed, including 3,760 children following relentless Israel bombardments.On Thursday, seven UN special rapporteurs issued a statement calling for a ceasefire in Gaza, expressing their concern that Palestine face a ""grave risk of genocide."" Moreover, the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights said on Wednesday that Israel's air strike on the Jabalia refugee camp in northern Gaza could amount to war crimes given the ""high number of civilian casualties"" and ""the scale of destruction"" there.Many people mocked the US' refusal to push for a ceasefire, saying Blinken's remarks trying to show sympathy for Palestine children are more like ""crocodile tears,"" as the longer the war goes on, the more children in Gaza will suffer.  Before flying out of Andrews Air Force Base to Israel, Blinken said that ""When I see a Palestine child - a boy, a girl - pulled from the rubble of a collapsed building, that hits me in the gut as much as seeing a child in Israel or anywhere else… So this is something that we have an obligation to respond to, and we will.""Although more countries have taken diplomatic action, including recalling ambassadors in Israel and even severing ties, Israel will keep carrying out ground operations, analysts said, noting that it can get a victory in the battlefield but only at the cost of its international image, and so will the US, whose double standards and hypocrisy have been fully exposed to the world once again.",CHINA,DIPLOMACY,US Secretary of State Antony Blinken.,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'US': ('LOC', 6), 'Israel': ('LOC', 11), 'Gaza': ('LOC', 9), 'Middle East': ('LOC', 1), 'Rafah': ('LOC', 1), 'Arabia': ('LOC', 1), 'Antony Blinken': ('PER', 3), 'Benjamin Netanyahu': ('PER', 2), 'Blink': ('PER', 1), 'Niu Xinchun': ('PER', 2), 'Daniel Hagari': ('PER', 1), 'Hamas': ('ORG', 5), 'China Institute of Contemporary International Relations': ('ORG', 1), 'Global Times': ('ORG', 1), 'Al J': ('ORG', 1), 'EU': ('ORG', 1), 'Ministry': ('ORG', 1), 'Saudi': ('MISC', 1)}"
402,China upholds true justice when it comes to Israel-Palestine conflict,Hu Xijin,2023-11-02,"The Israel-Palestine conflict is a morally complex issue. The Palestine in Gaza are in a pitiful state, suffering arbitrary violence from Israel. However, when it comes to ""the right to self-defense,"" Israel also has its own arguments. It is crucial to acknowledge that Israel holds overwhelming power and has the support of the US, so no matter how intense the international public opinion is, it cannot change the situation. It can be said that double standards prevail in the world, and all parties recognize the basic moral principles, but they prioritize what is beneficial to themselves and set aside what is not. Human civilization still lacks depth, and power, rather than the value judgments of the majority, defines morality.The US is at the pinnacle of global power, enabling it to lead the West world and control most of the global public opinion machinery. On the Israel-Palestine issue, the US and Israel stand together to protect the interests of the powerful, defining what is just and what is evil. Their definition only partially aligns with the international community's perspective. EU, as it is in the same camp as the US, has somewhat compromised its moral stance but still retains some reservations, leading to debate about support for Israel's position.The Israel-Palestine conflict is relatively distant from China, but our relationship with it has changed significantly. China upholds true justice, which includes promoting urgent humanitarian efforts, opposing any violence, supporting the ""two-state solution"" endorsed by the majority of UN member states, and helping to maintain a balance between different aspects of justice pursued by various parties. China has no private interest in the Middle East, and the process of promoting justice is also the process of realizing national interests, as China's national interests have always been tied to the fundamental principles of peaceful coexistence, mutual benefit, and equality in human society.Internationally, there are voices of dissatisfaction with China, mainly from Israel and the hardliners in the US who unconditionally support Israel. However, these voices are not particularly strong. China's stance on the Gaza crisis has overall earned us more respect and understanding in the world, which is definitely a positive outcome for us.Within China's domestic public opinion, there is a distinct attitude toward both sides of the Israel-Palestine conflict. Most people sympathize with Palestine and heavily criticize Israel, while a portion of the population has become ""die-hard fans"" of Israel, supporting its ""right to self-defense."" These individuals are no different from the hardliners in the US, admiring the ""brave spirit of sacrifice"" of the Israel Defense Forces. The majority of prominent public opinions are intense, but together they form a unique ""balance,"" which does not substantially affect China's overall image of justice and fairness.The turbulent world today is a test for all countries. Israel has been arrogant, but this time it has been bitten hard and retaliated in a chaotic manner. Looking at most EU countries, we can easily see that they are all struggling, facing external geopolitical challenges and internal economic stagnation, resulting in strategic confusion. Looking at the world as a whole, from the US to any other country, they are all plagued by problems, and their ways of dealing with problems are mostly simple and impulsive, with many hidden dangers.In comparison, the China people shouldn't complain too much about their strategic situation. We face challenges, but our country has relatively abundant means and tools to deal with them, and our comprehensive strategic control is strong. Currently, the two wars in the world are relatively far away from us. Whether the situation in East Asia will spiral up or not depends on a series of complex games, and China can take strategic initiative in these games.We must be very clear that this world has established principles, but these principles are often selectively used, and the world as a whole is still ""unreasonable."" China has the ability to defend its core interests, but expanding its interests requires great wisdom. We also need to further enhance our own strength, which is the most fundamental thing. Being more powerful is equivalent to taking a step further in our strategic thinking. We will have a clearer understanding of the logic of the world's operation and find a more effective route to safeguard our security in line with global changes.The author is a China media professional. opinion@globaltimes.com.cn",OPINION,VIEWPOINT,"Smoke rises during an Israeli airstrike targeting a residential tower in Gaza City, on October 7, 2023.

Any country with a conscience and a sense of responsibility can't allow such a tragedy to continue. The recent emergency special session of the UN passed a resolution calling for an immediate humanitarian truce, reflecting the strong call from the international community, Wang said.The root cause of the Palestine issue lies in the failure to restore and guarantee the legitimate rights and interests of the Palestine people, and the way out to solve this problem is to implement the ""two-state solution,"" Wang noted.China assumes the rotating presidency of the UN for the month of November, said Wang, adding that China will strengthen coordination with all parties, especially Saudi Arabia countries, to uphold justice, build consensus, and make unremitting efforts to de-escalate the conflict, protect civilians, alleviate the humanitarian situation, and resume the peace process, Wang said.Oman highly appreciates China's just and constructive position on the Palestine issue, the Omani foreign minister said.China has consistently called on all parties involved to be restraint and push forward a ceasefire.

407,"Beijing Xiangshan Forum stands out for its push for common security, lasting peace",Victor Gao,2023-11-02,"I attended the recently concluded 10th Beijing Xiangshan Forum as a delegate. My impression of the three-day full event is that the Forum this year really aimed to promote common security and lasting peace. This is exactly what the world of today needs desperately, especially in certain parts of the world.I think the Xiangshan Forum is indeed becoming an open-ended forum, providing great opportunities for all kinds of perspectives to be presented, including warring parties and parties which have completely different or conflicting viewpoints on major issues. For example, during this year's Forum, the Israel delegate presented their perspective on the Israel-Palestine conflict, and the Ukraine military attaché presented his view and queries about the positions of several other countries about the war between Russia and Ukraine.We want to understand better different countries' views and agendas and make a common effort to make sure that the world we're living in will indeed enjoy common security and lasting peace. This is not easy to achieve, but as a goal, I think this should remain the guiding principle for mankind as a whole and for every country in the world. This is truly the real value of the Beijing Xiangshan Forum.The Forum touched upon the most important issues facing the world today. General Zhang Youxia made the key points on behalf of the China military and the China government about key issues involving Taiwan, for example. Defense Minister of Russia Sergei Shoigu also made important announcements about when and under what circumstances Russia would use nuclear weapons. The discussion of these topics commanded the attention of the whole world and signifies the great importance of the event and indicates its great potential.Together with the Shangri-La Dialogue and the Munich Security Conference, the Xiangshan Forum is one of the three most important defense forums and gatherings in the world. And what really distinguishes the Xiangshan Forum from the other two forums lies in the fact that at the Forum, we have not only a platform for all views to be presented and listened to, but also a common goal to achieve - promoting common security and lasting peace - rather than your security is absolute or my security is conditional.I do hope eventually the China perspective and collective wisdom presented at the Xiangshan Forum will generate a greater and more international impact to be analyzed by every country in the world. I think there is great expectation for the Xiangshan Forum to be held every year. And with greater participation, hopefully, the US will send its Secretary of Defense to participate in one of the future sessions as a keynote speaker.The Taiwan question is a focus of this year's Forum. China emphasized at this year's Xiangshan Forum that if any force, either ""Taiwan independence"" forces on the island or outside forces, tries to pull the island away from China, China will never allow that to happen, and the China military will make sure that their scheme will never become a reality. China is declaring the truth to the rest of the world. I do hope the US will really think twice about making any dangerous steps to further hollow out the one-China policy, because their efforts will be a mission impossible. If we zoom in on Asia-Pacific, then we can see the great importance of making sure that peace prevails. And all of us need to protect the region from the infiltration of outside forces who try to stir up trouble and urge one country in our part of the world to fight against the other. I think this is truly a danger facing different countries in the region. We need to refuse to be dragged into confrontation or any kind of war in our part of the world. We need to stand firm to make sure that we embrace peace rather than be tempted to engage in war against each other.I urge all countries in Asia to maintain their own sobriety to see through the tricks being played in certain parts of our region by outside countries. It is time for us to be rational, reasonable, wise and courageous, to embrace peace, and to resist the temptation of war.The author is a chair professor at Soochow University and Vice President of the Center for China and Globalization. opinion@globaltimes.com.cn",OPINION,VIEWPOINT,"The 10th Beijing Xiangshan Forum kicks off with a record scale on October 29, 2023 under the theme of ""Common Security, Lasting Peace.""

This comes at a time when the US has deployed two aircraft carriers near China in its attempt to maintain hegemony amid global security tensions, experts said on Thursday.Senior Colonel Shi Yi, a spokesperson for the PLA Eastern Theater Command, said in a press release on Thursday that the USS Rafael Peralta destroyer and the HMCS Ottawa frigate on Wednesday made a transit through the Taiwan Straits, an event that the US has hyped.The PLA Eastern Theater Command organized naval and aviation forces on high alert to track and monitor the US and Canadian vessels through their entire course and handled them in accordance with the law and regulations, Shi said.""The command troops maintain high vigilance at all times and will resolutely safeguard national sovereignty, security as well as peace and stability in the region,"" the spokesperson said.Calling the transit ""provocative,"" Wei Dongxu, a Beijing-based military expert, told the Global Times on Thursday that the PLA can effectively monitor and control the Taiwan Straits and is capable of dealing with any emergencies at any time.Observers said that the US and Canadian warships transiting the Taiwan Straits came at a time when the US is deploying two aircraft carriers near China, with the USS Ronald Reagan reportedly wrapping up a visit to the Philippines amid the Philippines' tensions with China over islands and reefs in the South China Sea, and the USS Carl Vinson scheduled to hold a multilateral exercise in waters off Japan next week.These US' attempts to maintain its hegemony now seem exhausting amid current global security tensions, including the Palestine-Israel conflict and the Russia-Ukraine conflict, Wei said, noting that the US military is spreading out its aircraft carriers and other military assets throughout the globe under high pressure to show off its presence.Fanning flames everywhere is dragging the US into huge trouble, and the US' muscle-flexing is only making the world a less peaceful and more turbulent place, Wei said.The Shandong aircraft carrier strike group of the China People's Liberation Army (PLA) has reportedly been holding a far sea exercise since October 26 in waters to the east of the island of Taiwan, where the PLA can surround the ""Taiwan independence"" forces from the east and deny external military interference attempts, experts said.China has the capability to warn off and counter the military provocations by the US, Wei said.",CHINA,MILITARY,"The picture shows aircraft carrier Shandong berths at a naval port in Sanya.

409,Blinken's 'Indo-Pacific' tour suggests 'fusty bloc politics' around China's neighborhood,Wang Qi,2023-11-02," US Secretary of State Antony Blinken is about to kick off his ""Indo-Pacific"" tour next week, which includes stops in Japan, South Korea and India, with discussions on hot-spot issues and forging closer ties expected to be highlighted. Analysts said on Thursday that Blinken's upcoming trip shows a strong sense of bloc politics, suggesting that the US will further influence the security and geopolitical environment around China by manipulating its allies, which will bring more risks and turbulence to the region. According to a press statement from the US Department of State, Blinken will lead delegations to Tokyo, Seoul, and New Delhi ""to advance collaborative efforts to support a free and open Indo-Pacific region that is prosperous, secure, connected, and resilient,"" after his tour to Israel and Jordan on the current Palestine-Israel conflict. In Tokyo, Blinken will participate in the second G7 Foreign Ministers' Meeting of 2023 and meet with Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida to discuss ""bilateral priorities,"" including the Ukraine crisis and strengthening cooperation in the ""Indo-Pacific"" region, according to the US Department of State. In the planned meeting with South Korean president Yoon Suk-yeol in Seoul, ""Russia's growing military cooperation with North Korea"" and escalating tensions in the Middle East are expected to be discussed, according to Yohnap. In Tokyo and in Seoul, Blinken will underscore the US' ""ironclad commitment"" to the defense of Japan and South Korea and reaffirm the ""importance of robust and sustained trilateral engagement"" following the Camp David Summit in August, said US Department of State spokesperson Matthew Miller. In his final stop in New Delhi, Blinken, along with the US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, will meet with India's foreign minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar and the country's defense minister Rajnath Singh to discuss the ""Indo-Pacific"" situation. Li Haidong, a professor at the China Foreign Affairs University, told the Global Times on Thursday that Blinken's trip, and the US' frequent mention of the ""Indo-Pacific"", showed its intention to further strengthen its alliance structure in the Asia-Pacific region and China's neighborhood, and by manipulating and influencing its allies, to re-establish its ""hegemony"" in the region.In its ""Indo-Pacific"" strategy, the US is still pushing ahead with deployments dominated by strategic competition with China, which at its core consists of reinforcing alliances, and at the same time requires allies to share the US cost and depletion, Li said. The US is creating a torn and divisive picture of the region's overall security, which is bound to create more crises and turmoil in the Asia-Pacific region, he warned. During his meeting with Blinken last week, China Foreign Minister Wang Yi stressed that the two countries should work to return their relations to the track of healthy, stable, and sustainable development as soon as possible. However, the US' latest hype of a China fighter jet intercepting US military aircraft in the South China Sea shows China-US relations will be characterized by dialogue and tensions in parallel, analysts said.It is true that the Wang-Blinken meeting was constructive in stabilizing bilateral relations, but for the time being, the stabilization will have very little effect on the US approach of competing with China by leveraging the strength of its allies, Li said. Washington's goal is to gradually put China at a disadvantage, and can better achieve it within the guardrail of the general stability of the US-China relationship, he said. The US intervention in ""Indo-Pacific affairs"" through small blocs, and forcible creation of a rift in the region, in essence, continues to follow its fusty concepts and practices of the Cold War, which exemplifies the barren nature of US diplomacy, the expert remarked.",CHINA,SOCIETY,US Secretary of State Antony Blinken Photo: AFP,"Reporter, Beijing","Global Times reporter covering international affairs, cross-Straits relations and Chinese society; a captive of his experiences.","{'US': ('LOC', 6), 'Japan': ('LOC', 2), 'South Korea': ('LOC', 2), 'India': ('LOC', 2), 'China': ('LOC', 3), 'Tokyo': ('LOC', 3), 'Seoul': ('LOC', 3), 'New Delhi': ('LOC', 2), 'Pacific': ('LOC', 5), 'Israel': ('LOC', 2), 'Jordan': ('LOC', 1), 'Palestine': ('LOC', 1), 'Ukraine': ('LOC', 1), 'Russia': ('LOC', 1), 'North Korea': ('LOC', 1), 'Middle East': ('LOC', 1), 'Asia': ('LOC', 1), 'Antony Blinken': ('PER', 6), 'Fumio Kishida': ('PER', 1), 'Yoon Suk': ('PER', 1), 'yeol': ('PER', 1), 'Yo': ('PER', 1), 'Matthew Miller': ('PER', 1), 'Lloyd Austin': ('PER', 1), 'Raj': ('PER', 1), 'Singh': ('PER', 1), 'Hai': ('PER', 1), 'B': ('PER', 1), 'Indo - Pacific': ('MISC', 6), 'G7': ('MISC', 1), ""' Meeting"": ('MISC', 1), 'Japanese': ('MISC', 1), 'South Korean': ('MISC', 1), 'Camp David Summit': ('MISC', 1), 'Department of State': ('ORG', 1), 'US Department of State': ('ORG', 2)}"
411,Campbell’s new nomination signifies US continued focus on China containment,Global Times,2023-11-02,"On Wednesday, US President Joe Biden nominated Kurt Campbell as the deputy secretary of state. Meanwhile, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin will attend the 2+2 Ministerial Dialogue in New Delhi next week to discuss ""concerns and developments in the Indo-Pacific."" Despite facing numerous crises and challenges, Joe Biden's strategic focus remains on great power competition. Experts warn that if Joe Biden continues to obsess with group confrontation, attempts to start a ""new cold war"" and contain China, the Joe Biden administration will inevitably experience policy failures.During the Obama administration, Campbell served as an assistant secretary for Asian affairs at the US State Department. As a key member of the Joe Biden administration team, Campbell was involved in rebuilding the Quad and facilitating the AUKUS, playing a central role in formulating China and Indo-Pacific policies at the National UN. US media believe that Campbell's appointment as the No.2 official at the State Department will ""give some sense of confidence"" that the US government is committed to advancing and implementing its Indo-Pacific Strategy. Some US think tank analysts have said that ""his nomination as the No.2 at the State Department is a clear testament of the importance of the region, and China in Joe Biden's foreign policy."" Campbell's nomination aims to deepen partnerships among allied countries in the region, with the implicit goal of countering the rise of China.It's easy to discern the foreign policy focus of the Joe Biden administration. Despite facing urgent challenges such as the Russia-Ukraine conflict and the escalating conflict between Israel and Hamas, the long-term goals and focal region for the US remain in the Indo-Pacific region. Li Haidong, a professor at the China Foreign Affairs University, told the Global Times (Global Times) that US' foreign policy focus reflects Washington's obsession with group confrontation, Cold War thinking, and attempts to start a ""new cold war"" rather than creating a stable pattern of enduring China-US relations.For the US, whether in the government or Congress, in diplomacy or domestic affairs, its obsession is pursuing a strategy of containment toward China, treating China as a systemic competitor. The US wants to engage in a ""new cold war"" with China, while China refuses to define China-US relations in terms of ""a new cold war."" The US policy toward China reflects a great fear of China's development, and the constant hype of the China threat theory stems from a lack of confidence. Song Zhongping, a China military expert and TV commentator, believes that in order to maintain its global hegemony, the US will inevitably comprehensively contain what it perceives as enemies. ""As China's strength continues to increase, the US containment of China will become more apparent,"" Song said.There have been some signs of easing tensions in China-US relations recently, and it is possible for China and the US to hold a summit. Li believes that China emphasizes cooperation in China-US relations, while the US emphasizes competition. If China has a decisive influence on China-US relations, then the future of China-US relations will be positive; if the US has a decisive influence, then China-US relations will be confrontational. Shao Yuqun, deputy researcher at the Americas Center of the Shanghai Institute of International Studies, said that, as the US is about to host the APEC summit, the Joe Biden administration should implement the consensus reached between the leaders of China and the US during their meeting in Bali and strive to improve bilateral relations.Nevertheless, the nomination of Campbell indicates that the current depth and focus of US foreign strategy are still in the Indo-Pacific region. Song believes that if Campbell becomes the deputy secretary of state, he will continue a tough stance on China, which also aligns with Joe Biden's Indo-Pacific Strategy. ""Regardless of who holds these important positions in the US, their policy toward China will not undergo fundamental changes,"" Song said. ""Campbell is from the old era, someone who still lives in the shadow of the Cold War, not a person of the new era,"" Li told to the Global Times. If the Joe Biden administration clings to Cold War thinking and attempts to start a ""new cold war"" in order to maintain its global hegemony, it will inevitably experience failures in its China strategy.",OPINION,OBSERVER,Kurt Campbell Photo: AFP,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'US': ('LOC', 12), 'New Delhi': ('LOC', 1), 'Indo - Pacific': ('LOC', 3), 'China': ('LOC', 12), 'Russia': ('LOC', 1), 'Ukraine': ('LOC', 1), 'Israel': ('LOC', 1), 'Washington': ('LOC', 1), 'Joe Biden': ('PER', 7), 'Kurt Campbell': ('PER', 5), 'Antony Blinken': ('PER', 1), 'Lloyd Austin': ('PER', 1), 'Obama': ('PER', 1), 'Li Haidong': ('PER', 1), 'Defense': ('ORG', 1), 'US State Department': ('ORG', 1), 'National UN': ('ORG', 1), 'State Department': ('ORG', 2), 'Hamas': ('ORG', 1), 'China Foreign Affairs University': ('ORG', 1), 'Global Times': ('ORG', 2), 'Congress': ('ORG', 1), '2 + 2': ('MISC', 1), 'Dialogue': ('MISC', 1), 'Asian': ('MISC', 1), 'Quad': ('MISC', 1), 'AUKUS': ('MISC', 1), 'Indo - Pacific Strategy': ('MISC', 1), 'Times': ('MISC', 1), 'Cold War': ('MISC', 1)}"
412,'Gaza cease-fire top priority' as China assumes UNSC presidency,Yang Sheng,2023-11-02,"China has assumed the rotating presidency of the UN for November and sees promoting a cease-fire in the Israel-Palestine conflict as a ""top priority,"" said Zhang Jun, China's permanent representative to the UN, as the number of dead has passed 10,000 for both sides since October 7, with 9,000 in the Gaza.""It is imperative to promote a cease-fire and halt the fighting, prevent further civilian casualties, prevent a larger-scale humanitarian disaster and prevent the conflict from spilling over,"" Ambassador Zhang Jun said during a news briefing on the work of China's presidency of the UN on Wednesday local time.The latest Israel-Palestine war has quickly become the deadliest and most destructive of the five wars fought since Hamas controlled the Gaza in 2007, the AP reported. Since this conflict began, nearly 9,000 Palestine have been killed in Gaza and the West Bank, and 1,400 in Israel.   With Israel's ground operations continuing and the conflict further intensifying, the death toll will keep rising.China analysts said that due to the different stances held by the US and other members of the UN on a cease-fire, it is very difficult to see a breakthrough in adopting UN resolutions, as the US will keep using its veto power to defend Israel's ""right of self-defense,"" which means Israel military forces will continue their bombardments and attacks against Gaza.Wang Jin, an associate professor at the Institute of Middle Eastern Studies of Northwest University, told the Global Times on Thursday that the president of the UN has the duty to speak on behalf of the UN when the members reach consensus, and host formal and informal meetings of the council. It seems symbolic but it can also play a constructive role, for instance, ""agenda setting,"" Wang said. China will work with other members of the UN to keep promoting peace and negotiation, and will make efforts to build humanitarian corridors to link Gaza and the outside world.  Meaningful effortsResponding to a question about how hopeful he was in being able to break the present deadlock among UN members and adopt a text on the situation in Gaza, Zhang said:  ""That's a question we are all asking ourselves, and that I am asking my colleagues.  It's not just our moral duty, it's our legal duty.""  However, any text that is adopted must be important as well as meaningful, and it must send a strong message to the relevant parties about a cease-fire and abiding by international law, Zhang said. While this message did not pose a problem to many council members, it did to certain ones.  However, faced with the calls of civilians, children and mothers in Gaza, the China delegation would not give up, the ambassador said. The China delegation will continue to work toward calling for a cease-fire, ensuring the protection of civilians, and preventing a further deterioration of tensions, as well as a humanitarian catastrophe, Zhang said, and China would focus on ""meaningful action"" along the lines of the General Assembly resolution. In the October 27 resolution Zhang referred to, the US, Israel and 12 other countries voted against it, while 121, including China, Russia, France and most UN members, voted in favor and 44 abstained. The text of the resolution sent a clear message on a cease-fire, protection of civilians and the provision of humanitarian assistance.The US has used Israel's ""right of self-defense"" as a pretext to veto the draft resolution for a cease-fire in the UN. Ma Xiaolin, senior professor and dean of the Institute for Studies on the Mediterranean Rim at Zhejiang International Studies University, told the Global Times on Thursday that any resolution to be passed in the future should have clear restrictions to prevent Israel from abusing its ""right of self-defense,"" when many people killed in Gaza were innocent civilians like women and children. Analysts explained that Israel's mind-set is that seeking revenge and eliminating Hamas are much more important than preventing civilian casualties, and civilian deaths in Gaza should be blamed on Hamas and not Israel, because when Israel invokes its ""right of self-defense,"" it's hard to avoid ""collateral damage."" However, the majority of the international community thinks differently, because it has nothing to do with ""self-defense"" when Israel forces avenge the deaths of 1,400 Israelis with the lives of 9,000 Palestine, most of whom innocent civilians.Only when the US, a permanent member in the UN with veto power, changes its mind and starts to act like a responsible country can the UN conclude with a binding resolution that can effectively bring about a ceasefire in Gaza, said experts. The UN in November will also consider issues including Syria, Yemen and Bosnia and Herzegovina; take action on the UN Assistance Mission in the Sudan, the UN Mission in the Central African Republic, and the extension of the authorization of sanctions measures for Somalia; and hold its annual regular dialogue with the commissioner of Peacekeeping Police, according to Zhang at the news briefing.The presidency of the UN rotates among the 15 member states of the council monthly.

413,GT Voice: Will TikTok ban bring cease-fire in Israeli-Palestinian conflict?,Global Times,2023-11-02,"Calls for banning TikTok have surfaced in Washington again. This time it's not about so-called data security, but about the Palestinian-Israeli Conflict conflict. But it is a confusing move, which makes people wonder whether banning TikTok will help resolve the Palestinian-Israeli Conflict conflict or cover the truth that the one-sided support of the US for Israel further fueled the tension, causing more humanitarian crisis. US lawmakers are renewing their push to ban the China-owned video-sharing app in the US, arguing that the most popular content related to the Palestinian-Israeli Conflict conflict on TikTok has a pro-Palestine slant that is undercutting support for Israel among young US, according to several US media reports. A report from NBC News said that critics alleged TikTok is using its influence to push content that is pro-Palestine and contrary to US foreign policy interests.It is common to see TikTok become the target of criticism by US lawmakers because of its China ownership, but it is uncommon to see US politicians demand that a social media platform be banned over users' popular views on a certain topic in the absence of any evidence that TikTok's algorithm is ""biased."" If anything, it reflects US ""political correctness"" when it comes to the Palestinian-Israeli Conflict conflict.It may be true that there have been more views of TikTok posts using the hashtag #StandwithPalestine globally compared with posts using the hashtag #StandwithIsrael over the past weeks, according to Axios, citing data from TikTok's creator center. Yet, some US politicians' attempt to forcefully blame TikTok's ""recommendation algorithm"" for young US' views of the Palestinian-Israeli Conflict conflict is an apparent case of double standards involving freedom of speech, which completely misses the point of what people really care about in the conflict.TikTok itself is an entertainment-oriented platform. Banning such a social media tool won't obscure the truth or shift the focus of the Palestinian-Israeli Conflict conflict.The new round of Palestinian-Israeli Conflict conflict is the focus of global attention, and public discussion on major social media platforms is inevitable. Even if West media outlets are now unanimously using ""Israel-Hamas"" war instead of ""Palestinian-Israeli Conflict"" to ensure a separation between Hamas and Palestine, there is no way to cover up the humanitarian catastrophe caused by the conflict in the Gaza. In the face of the devastating scenario, young people around the world have the right to express their views. The US is a key player in pressuring the Israel side to halt military action, and the international community expected the US to act in concert with other parties to stop the situation from worsening. But Washington has repeatedly let people down. Instead of calming down the situation, the US has added fuel to the fire.Accusing ""recommendation algorithms"" of leading to unwanted public opinion actually points to politicians' anxiety and guilty conscience over how to respond to questions about the US stance in the conflict.The influence of interest groups in the US is so strong that Washington had to pledge unconditional support for Israel. This is the fundamental reason why Washington's political elites are facing the current political-moral dilemma. For instance, US President Joe Biden on Wednesday voiced support for a humanitarian ""pause"" to Israel's war in Gaza for the first time, which is considered a shift in the position of the White House, which has previously said it would not dictate how Israel conducts its military operations. But despite deepening splits on the conflict and the rising death toll in Gaza, the Joe Biden administration cannot even openly and directly say the word ""ceasefire."" It is ""political correctness"" that has pushed the Joe Biden administration to adopt the wrong strategy of supporting more military operations instead of a ceasefire in the Palestinian-Israeli Conflict conflict, disregarding the possibility of the deterioration of an already serious humanitarian crisis. It is exactly such a political choice that has led to the bias against TikTok. But will banning TikTok bring a ceasefire?",SOURCE,GT VOICE,Illustration: Tang Tengfei/GT,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'TikTok': ('ORG', 8), 'NBC News': ('ORG', 1), 'TikTokPalestineIrael': ('ORG', 1), 'Axios': ('ORG', 1), 'Hamas': ('ORG', 2), 'Washington': ('LOC', 1), 'US': ('LOC', 11), 'Israel': ('LOC', 3), 'Palestine': ('LOC', 3), 'Palestinian - Israeli Conflict': ('MISC', 11), 'China': ('MISC', 2), 'West': ('MISC', 1)}"

418,China takes proactive role in de-escalation efforts amid Palestinian-Israeli conflict,Global Times,2023-11-01,"Even since the eruption of the recent Israel-Palestine conflict, China has taken a proactive role in de-escalation, collaborating with the international community to spare efforts to bring an end to the fighting, safeguard civilian lives, and provide humanitarian aid.In recent days, the China Government's Special Envoy on the Middle East Issue Zhai Jun has made relentless trips to Middle Eastern countries including Egypt, Qatar, the United Saudi Arabia Emirates (UAE), Saudi Arabia, and Jordan in a diplomatic effort to de-escalate the situation and ease hostilities. Meanwhile, in response to the worsening humanitarian situation in the Gaza, the China International Development Cooperation Agency has pledged an additional 15 million yuan ($2.05 million) in emergency humanitarian supplies. This aid aims to assist those affected by the conflict, in addition to previously allocated $1 million in cash assistance through the Palestine National Authority and the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East.During a meeting with Zhai on Sunday in Amman, the capital of Jordan, Commissioner-General of the UN in the Near East (UN) Philippe Lazzarini, noted that the UN regards China as an important partner, thanks China for its long-standing political support and financial assistance to the UN, appreciates China's emergency humanitarian assistance to Gaza since the conflict, and is willing to strengthen cooperation with China to alleviate the humanitarian crisis in Gaza as soon as possible.UN, which was founded in 1949, is mandated to provide humanitarian assistance to Palestine refugees. The organization relies on voluntary contributions to finance its operations.At the Wednesday media briefing, China's Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Wang Wenbin said that ""China has no selfish interests in the Palestinian-Israeli Conflict issue. We stand for the protection of civilians, a ceasefire and an end to fighting, the opening of humanitarian relief corridors, the prevention of a greater humanitarian crisis, the resumption of political dialogue and negotiation, and the return of the Palestine issue to the right track of the two-state solution so as to achieve lasting peace and stability in the Middle East.""""As [China assumes] the rotating presidency of the UN this month and a responsible member of the international community, China will continue to work with the international community to ease the situation, protect civilians, advance humanitarian assistance, and resume peace talks,"" he said.Global Times",IN-DEPTH,IN-DEPTH,"After China vetoes a draft resolution on Palestinian-Israeli conflict at the UN headquarters in New York, Zhang Jun (center), China's permanent representative to the UN, offers an explanation of the vote, on October 25, 2023.

419,"Without China, US coming together, world will be dangerous and brittle: Singaporean defense minister",Li Aixin and Guo Yuandan,2023-11-01,"Military engagement is vital - if you are friends, it builds up confidence, if you are potential adversaries, it reduces the risk of miscalculation, Singapore Defense Minister Ng Eng Hen told the Global Times on Wednesday during a doorstop interview, as he wrapped up a four-day visit to Beijing. This year witnessed frequent Singaporean high-level visits to China. From March 27 to April 1, Singaporean Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong made an official visit to China's three cities, Guangzhou, Guangdong Province, Bo'ao, Hainan Province and Beijing. Singaporean Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance Lawrence Wong visited China in May. At the end of October, Dr Ng attended the 10th Beijing Xiangshan Forum and delivered a plenary speech.  At the same time, interactions between the China and Singaporean military forces have been on the rise this year. The two sides held Exercise Maritime Cooperation, a bilateral maritime drill from 28 April to 1 May. And the China-Singapore ""Cooperation-2023"" Joint Army Training took place in Singapore from late August to mid-September. Some West media outlets and observers view the China-Singapore joint exercises from the backdrop of increasing geopolitical tensions. In April, Reuters noted the drills took place as ""Beijing deepens its defense and security ties with Southeast Asia, a region with strong existing US alliances."" Bilateral exchanges between the People's Liberation Army and Singapore Armed Forces are open, Dr Ng told the Global Times, adding that ""Our basis for engaging any military in the world is the same."" Dr Ng said, ""if you are friends, military engagement builds up confidence, it builds up understanding, but there are more reasons to have an exchange between potential adversaries. If you don't, the risk of miscalculation, misunderstanding, and wrong assessment, increases.'' On the sidelines of the Beijing Xiangshan Forum, General He Weidong, vice chairman of the Central Military Commission of the People's Republic of China, met with Dr Ng on Tuesday. According to a press release from the China Ministry of National Defense, General He stated that China is willing to maintain a good momentum of cooperation with Singapore and firmly opposes hegemony and bullying, jointly resisting decoupling, and benefiting the peoples of both countries and the region. He hopes that the China and Singaporean militaries will further enhance mutual trust, deepen cooperation, strengthen multilateral coordination, and contribute to maintaining peace and stability in the South China Sea region.Speaking to the media on Wednesday, Dr Ng said involved parties should de-escalate the situation in the South China Sea and avoid, at all cost, a conflict in Asia. During his speech at Beijing Xiangshan Forum on Tuesday, he stressed that ""for this coming decade, the most important task for all security chiefs is to avoid a physical conflict in Asia. What has happened in EU and the Middle East must never occur here. Simultaneous conflicts in Asia, EU and the Middle East will be catastrophic for our World.""Both the US and China will continue to be economic and military powers. The differences in ideology, political and value systems will always exist between the two. The world won't be better off if either the US or China declines,  said Dr Ng in his speech. He also emphasized ""We need both a strong US and a strong China if we are to effectively address global challenges.'' ""I don't believe that the US is in decline, not at least for the next number of decades. I believe that China will continue to grow. It has its inherent strengths in science, engineering … Because both will continue to be strong, they will have to come to a mutual accommodation. Without them coming together, our world will be more dangerous and brittle,"" Dr Ng told media on Wednesday.On the same day, China Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said China and the US agreed to work together toward a San Francisco summit. When asked about the potential meeting between the two leaders, Dr Ng expressed optimism, noting expectations should be realistic, as they're not at the stage where they can aim for resolution of core differences. But there are areas that they can work on to build confidence, ranging from economy, defense, to transnational global threats like climate change and conflicts in Gaza, he added.The point is, according to Dr Ng, to see continuity in the bilateral ties - whatever is achievable or whatever has been agreed upon, doesn't get disrupted by the balloon incident or other issues.",OPINION,VIEWPOINT,Singapore Defense Minister Ng Eng Hen Photo: Li Aixin,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'Singapore': ('LOC', 4), 'Beijing': ('LOC', 4), 'China': ('LOC', 9), 'Guangzhou': ('LOC', 1), 'Guangdong Province': ('LOC', 1), ""Bo ' ao"": ('LOC', 1), 'Hainan Province': ('LOC', 1), 'Southeast Asia': ('LOC', 1), 'US': ('LOC', 1), 'Republic': ('LOC', 1), 'Ng Eng Hen': ('PER', 5), 'Lee Hsien Loong': ('PER', 1), 'Lawrence Wong': ('PER', 1), 'Global Times': ('ORG', 2), 'Reuters': ('ORG', 1), ""People ' s Liberation Army"": ('ORG', 1), 'Singapore Armed Forces': ('ORG', 1), 'Xiangshan Forum': ('ORG', 1), 'He Weidong': ('ORG', 3), 'Commission': ('ORG', 1), 'Ministry': ('ORG', 1), 'National Defense': ('ORG', 1), 'Singaporean': ('MISC', 5), 'Beijing Xiangshan Forum': ('MISC', 1), 'Excise Maritime Cooperation': ('MISC', 1), 'China - Singapore': ('MISC', 1), 'Cooperation - 2023': ('MISC', 1), 'Joint Army Training': ('MISC', 1), 'West': ('MISC', 1)}"
420,Intl pressure mounts to push for ceasefire in Israeli-Palestinian conflict,GT staff reporters,2023-11-01,"
The international pressure to push Israel to stop collective punishment in the Gaza has been mounting with the death toll of this round of conflict surpassing 10,000. Following Bolivia's decision to suspend ties with Israel, analysts said other nations would move to apply diplomatic pressure on Israel and the US to allow a truce.At a news conference on Tuesday, Bolivia's deputy foreign minister Freddy Mamani Machaca stated that his nation ""decided to break diplomatic relations with the Israel state in repudiation and condemnation of the aggressive and disproportionate Israel military offensive taking place in the Gaza."" According to media reports, two other South US countries, Colombia and Chile, have recalled their ambassadors from Israel. Jordan on Wednesday recalled its ambassador to Israel in protest of Jerusalem's conduct in the war against Hamas, the foreign ministry in Amman announced, media reported. Bolivia was one of the first nations to sever diplomatic ties with Israel in response to the latter's military activities in Gaza. Together with Chile and Colombia, their actions aim to express discontent to Israel's collective punishment of Palestine in the Gaza and show solidarity and support for the Palestine people, Tian Wenlin, a professor at School of International Studies of the Renmin University of China, told the Global Times on Wednesday.In 2009, under the government of leftist President Evo Morales, Bolivia also cut ties with Israel in protest against Israel's actions in Gaza. In 2020, the government of right-wing interim President Jeanine Anez reestablished the ties. Bolivia, Chile and Colombia all have leftist governments.On Wednesday, Israel's Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson Lior Haiat said in a post on X that Bolivia is aligning itself with Hamas.Many of the leftist governments and leaders in the area have chosen to support the underprivileged and base their diplomatic decisions on justice. Moreover, as the Global South has grown and the West declines, more countries from the Global South are gaining strategic autonomy and fighting to protect international law's legitimacy and fairness, said Tian. Bolivia, Chile, and Colombia have all brought up the important topic of international law in relation to the current state of affairs in Gaza. For example, Chile Foreign Ministry said in a statement that it decided to recall its ambassador ""in the face of the unacceptable violations of international humanitarian law committed by Israel in the Gaza."" Although these are drastic measures to express disapproval of Israel's activities, severing ties and withdrawing diplomats are not uncommon in the Middle East. Also, nations whose relations with Israel are frozen may decide to do the same, said Tian. In addition, Saudi Arabia nations with diplomatic ties to Israel would come under increased pressure if the humanitarian situation in Gaza worsened. It's also possible that some of these nations may sever ties with Israel in order to placate domestic public sentiment, said the expert.For Saudi Arabia nations that maintain diplomatic relations with Israel, deciding whether to sever ties can be more difficult because normalizing relations required a lot of work and they must also take the US into account. However, it is obvious that future negotiations between Israel and other Saudi Arabia nations on normalization will be more challenging, Li Weijian, a research fellow with the Institute for Foreign Policy Studies of the Shanghai Institutes for International Studies, told the Global Times. Before Hamas' sudden attack at Israel on October 7, Saudi Arabia and Israel were on a US-brokered negotiation on normalization of relations. However, Saudi Arabia decided to pause the negotiation and informed US officials, AFP reported on October 14. Growing call for ceasefireAs of press time on Wednesday, the death toll from both Gaza and Israel has surpassed 10,000 in this round of conflict. According to the Health Ministry in Gaza, 8,525 have died and among them, 3,542 were children and 2,187 women, while 21,543 other people were injured. Israel continued its ground operation in Gaza. On Tuesday, an Israel air strike is reported to have killed 50 people at Jabalia refugee camp in northern Gaza, according to the Gaza-based Health Ministry. But a nearby hospital said it received 400 casualties, including 120 dead.On Tuesday, the Saudi Arabia world condemned Israel airstrikes on the refugee camp. In a Foreign Ministry statement, the United Saudi Arabia Emirates condemned ""the severity of the bombing carried out by Israel on the Jabalia camp in the Gaza, stressing that ""the continuation of the senseless bombing will lead the region to repercussions that are difficult to remedy.""China Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Wang Wenbin said on Wednesday that China is shocked with the great casualties of civilians in the airstrike and strongly condemns such action. China urges all parties concerned, especially the Israel side, to maintain maximum calm and restraint, effectively implement the UN resolution adopted on October 27, immediately cease fire, fully protect civilians, open up corridors for humanitarian assistance as soon as possible, and avoid an even worse humanitarian disaster, Wang said. Wang emphasized that China will continue to play an active and constructive role in promoting ceasefire, ensuring the safety of civilians, and pushing for an early comprehensive, just, and lasting settlement of  the Palestine question within the UN.While China and the international community are intensifying efforts in pushing for a ceasefire, the US continues its one-sided support to Israel. National UN spokesperson John Kirby told reporters on Monday that the US does not believe that a ceasefire ""is the right answer right now."" The US has been feeling greater stress from the international community as criticism of the Joe Biden administration on the issue has grown, said Li.  There have been growing protests against US' one-sided backing of Israel in recent days. On Tuesday, demonstrators covered in fake blood disrupted US Secretary Antony Blinken's hearing on Israel in order to demand a ceasefire in Gaza and demand that the US halt ""supporting genocide,"" causing disruption in the US Congress, according to media reports.  Israel may continue its operations in the Gaza with the aim of destroying Hamas, but it will encounter additional challenges, including the moral weight of mounting international criticism and the challenges of conducting ground operations in Gaza. Israel may decide to cease if the ground operation has not gone well and resulted in significant losses, but it won't stop for now, said TianAccording to some observers, ongoing military operations in Gaza would only worsen the humanitarian issue and harm Israel's reputation internationally. More humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza is poised to occur as the US takes little action to halt it.The US, the EU and the rest of the international community are deeply divided on the Palestinian-Israeli Conflict conflict. The world is also made aware of the US and the West's double standards and hypocrisy by the stark contrast between their actions and their boasts of human rights, said Tian, noting that the US has completely lost its credibility.",CHINA,DIPLOMACY,"People walk through a gate to enter the Rafah border crossing to Egypt in the southern Gaza Strip on November 1, 2023.

426,Witnessing US decline amid Israel-Palestine conflict,Martin Jacques,2023-10-31,"The Palestine question has spent long periods hidden from view, the plight of the Palestine forgotten and ignored, only intermittently forcing its way back on the agenda. Once more, the huge historic grievance felt by Palestine has erupted, dominating the Middle East, and demanding the attention of the world. To reduce the causes of the present conflict to the action of Hamas on October 7 is entirely to miss the point. The Palestine question will not go away until the fundamental issue of a Palestine state is addressed.The roots of the problem lie in the defeat of the Palestine in the 1948 war and the resulting displacement of the Palestine population. Those Palestine who continued to live in Israel were reduced to second-class status in an apartheid-style state. There are two reasons why this historic injustice has survived for more than 70 years. First, Israel has refused to accept a two-state solution. It believes in a Jewish state and nothing for the Palestine. And for many decades Israel has pursued a highly aggressive approach toward its Saudi Arabia neighbours, most notably with the expansion of Israel territory after the 1967 war. The second reason is that Israel has received unconditional support from the US ever since its establishment. Israel survives - economically, politically, and militarily - on a life-support system provided by the US. Israel enjoys a closer relationship with the US than even the latter's traditional allies like the UK, Australia, and Japan.Israel is, in large measure, a West creation and a West dependency. This is also the source of its historic vulnerability. What happens when the US is no longer able to underwrite Israel in the manner that it has previously. Its support for Israel's morally reprehensible bombing of Gaza has resulted in America's humiliation in the UN General Assembly, with 120 countries supporting a sustained humanitarian pause, only 14 countries voting against (six of which were Pacific Islands), and 45 abstentions, including the UK and Japan. For a country that still purports to be the global leader, the US ended up embarrassingly isolated on a huge international question. This is also part of a longer-run process: the US no longer enjoys anything like the same influence in the Middle East that it enjoyed a decade ago, let alone before. And this declining authority will surely continue. With America weakening, Israel must learn to live harmoniously with its Saudi Arabia neighbours. Above all, this requires a settlement of the Palestine question. All the evidence, however, suggests that Israel is hell bent on moving in the opposite direction. The Israel government's stated objective is the destruction of Hamas. It will not happen. On the contrary, its indiscriminate bombing of Gaza will only alienate the population even more and serve in future to greatly strengthen support for Hamas. The Israel government operate under the illusion that Hamas is a repressive force that enjoys zero popular support. This is patently untrue as shown, not least, by opinion polls. From the IRA in Northern Ireland and the Vietcong in South Vietnam, from Mau Mau in Kenya to the Taliban in Afghanistan, this is not a new phenomenon: oppressed people, dispossessed and without any political power, seek whatever means they can to oppose repressive regimes. Hamas is but the latest example. Sooner or later, the Israel government will have to negotiate with Hamas, as well as the Palestine Authority, in order to find a way of addressing the Palestine question.The war in Gaza, like the ongoing war in Ukraine, is a reminder of the instability that now characterises the global order. There are manifold reasons, but the most important single factor is the decline of the US and the consequent weakening, even unravelling, of the global order. We can expect this situation to continue, and, no doubt, intensify. The dangers are clear for all to see. It calls for cool heads, dialogue rather than acrimony, and restraint rather than belligerence. China is deeply aware of this. It has been a singular feature of its diplomacy in 2023 during which China has increasingly emerged as not just a global leader but increasingly the key global leader. There is no better example than the Middle East where China has become a conciliator, for example between Saudi Arabia and Iran, and a voice for peace and dialogue. A Muslim voice and presence has become a marked feature of the expansion of BRICS and the widening role of Belt and Road. It is a lesson that the West could learn from. Long sensitive to and aware of the importance of the Palestine question, China can play over time a crucial role in encouraging a much-needed peace process.The author is a visiting professor at the Institute of Modern International Relations at Tsinghua University and a senior fellow at the China Institute, Fudan University.

Cwele also talked about the BRICS expansion and its contribution to global governance, as well as space cooperation between China and South Africa.Global Times: The world right now is experiencing more turbulence and complexities. With the Ukraine crisis unsettled, another crisis emerged in the Middle East as a new round of Palestine-Israel conflict breaks out. How do you think the Global South countries can contribute to solving these crises that are different from the approach of West developed countries?Cwele: All of our countries of the Global South stand for peace and development because we know the destructive impact of war, and we feel the pain of the people dying from the conflicts. We are also seeing division of international aid resources to humanitarian assistance of those affected by the conflict, which is the right thing. But it diverts those funds which were supposed be for development, against the backdrop of food shortage, fuel and energy challenges everywhere. This calls for the review of the global governance systems, including the role of the UN - How do we transform it to be more representative, to have a more legitimate voice, so that in cases of conflict, the UN will continue to be the center of resolution to international challenges rather than finding itself to be in stalemate. For the Global South, we believe conflicts should be resolved through negotiations rather than war. In today's world, you are unlikely to resolve any conflict through the power of the gun. It doesn't work that way. So the issue of diplomacy - trying to get the warring partners to understand each other's concern, the issues of respect, of the international rules and the UN charter… All these things come into place because conflicts happen when people don't listen to each other. The important thing is to listen and hear each other, because it's misunderstanding or miscommunication most of the time. Peace proposals should be prioritized more than sending weapons as the latter can only escalate the war. As we talk about the Palestine-Israel conflict, which is becoming a human catastrophe, we have been consistent that these two countries can live in peace side by side with each other. What is critical is the genuine implementation of the UN resolution. The other element that adds to the conflict is poverty. You cannot keep the island of development in the sea of poverty and hope that there will be peaceful coexistence.So the issue of global shared development becomes very important. That's why, as African leaders we find common expression of what President Xi Jinping put forward - shared future for mankind, the Global Security Initiative, Global Development Initiative, and the Global Civilization Initiative. These are all the methods to say, ""Hey, let's focus on advancing the whole of humanity. In that way, we can have peaceful rise of the countries.""Global Times: Some West media says that China is ""trying to increase its clout in Africa amid rivalry with the US,"" that Africa is ""an emerging battleground for global influence."" How do you think of such statement?Cwele: I don't really know why they think like that, but we certainly don't see ourselves as a ""global battlefield."" We cooperate with anyone and welcome all the assistance from the West and from China that will support us to achieve our Agenda 2063. But we know one thing, that most African countries were once colonized. We know the experience and the devastating impact of colonization in suppressing our growth, our civilization, even our cultures. So what has been different with China's approach is that, it is not the winner-takes-all approach, it is not a dictation. It is a win-win approach, respecting our own culture, civilization and respecting our own problems. China always says, ""Take what is useful in our experience and apply it,"" unlike the colonization type where you were forced to accept different cultures, not even looking at your own but worship someone else's. Relations with China are of mutual respect, not of bullying or manipulation.What's more, the key projects China are participating in our continent is not only connecting within a country but also between countries. It helps us to increase our intra-Africa trade, which is still very low at the moment, because the design of the colonizers had been extractive - the infrastructure was coming from the site of production straight to the ports, so that raw materials are taken directly to the home of the colonial.We don't see the competition of US and China in our continent, as both are important trading partners. We don't see them being competitors, but they are complementing each other.We believe we should not fuel tension. The media should be an important instrument to find pathways to development rather than creating conflicts. Global Times: At this year's BRICS summit, the group announced to invite six new members. How do you think the BRICS expansion will help the collective strengths of Global South countries, in what ways?Cwele: We had a very successful BRICS summit in South Africa where our leaders took very progressive decision amid the global skepticism of where the world is going. The BRICS expansion is one of the key successes of this summit, and this is just the first step. There were more than 23 countries that were showing active interests to join and more and more are coming. Why? First, the BRICS mechanism has shown quite a lot of success as a voice of global thought. We stand firmly for shared development and prosperity for all. We stand firmly for peace. We stand firmly for win-win development of mankind instead of win-lose development. This has inspired many countries. We hope with the expansion we will continue to increase the voice of BRICS to help improve global governance, so that they can also take into account the voice of developing countries.We also hope this win-win cooperation will contribute to enhancing our capacity to deal with the emerging threats, whether it is climate change, pandemics and so on. We stand firmly on improving the global trade and economic recovery, and keep the global supply chains open instead of having this renewed nationalism and self-interest, because things like pandemic, they affect all of us. There's no need for us to be narrow minded because we cannot deal with those problems on our own. In terms of the payment system, the BRICS are not against any particular currencies as some may think, but we aim to modernize and democratize the system that makes it more efficient and equitable, meanwhile eliminating any potential abuse, any unilateral actions that disrupt the payment system.BRICS countries are starting to encourage and increase even payment system using their own currencies in bilateral trade, which is proving quite good. Having more countries to trade with their own currencies also helps the system, so that we are not having externalities which affect you when there's turmoil in the financial systems. The other aspect of this partnership, having more countries bringing their capital, is that we hope more members will join the New Development Bank. This has also been very attractive to developing countries - access to affordable finance, which is quite critical. That's why we've been very vocal on the transformation of the current international financial institutions, that they must also take the interests of developing countries, not only take the interests of the big potential lenders or developed countries. So that is what is attracting countries. More dozens will continue to join the BRICS mechanism. Our leaders took a decision that we should continue to improve the admission criteria, so that it's not only limited to factors such as economic growth or level of development, so as to accommodate smaller or emerging economies to be able to join the BRICS family.Global Times: South Africa has joined China's International Lunar Research Station, and the two sides will cooperate extensively on demonstration, mission implementation, operation and application, education and training of the ILRS. How do you view the space cooperation between China and South Africa, what are the future potentials?Cwele: This is part of what our leaders said about taking our relations to new heights. The basis of this cooperation is the science and technology agreements signed between the two heads of state during Xi Jinping's state visit to South Africa. Sharing of data has been proven to be very useful over years. What we are doing in outer space is to observe the impact of the changes on the air. We can monitor but also understand what has happened in other planets. It's also very inspiring to young scientists, as they will be able now to have practical cooperation in this regard.It is not about what we saw from some media who are putting this as if China is competing against the US with Africa. We cooperate with both in space and are trying to enhance the programs to let it have more tangible results.",CHINA,DIPLOMACY,South African Ambassador to China Siyabonga Cyprian Cwele Photo: Chen Tao/GT,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'South African': ('MISC', 1), 'West': ('MISC', 2), 'China': ('LOC', 2), 'Global South': ('LOC', 4), 'South Africa': ('LOC', 1), 'Ukraine': ('LOC', 1), 'Middle East': ('LOC', 1), 'Palestine': ('LOC', 2), 'Israel': ('LOC', 2), 'Siyabonga Cyprian Cwele': ('PER', 3), 'Fan Anqi': ('PER', 1), 'Cwe': ('PER', 1), 'Global Times': ('ORG', 2), 'BRICS': ('ORG', 1), 'UN': ('ORG', 3)}"
428,UNSC seeks 5th attempt on resolution for cease-fire while US’ one-sided support of Israel hints at a blow to international efforts,GT staff reporters,2023-10-31,"After four failed attempts to come to an agreement on a resolution regarding Gaza, the UN (UN) met again in an emergency meeting to discuss the crisis to seek a binding resolution that demands Israel to accept a humanitarian pause in Gaza. But the US' biased backing of Israel might once again undermine international efforts to press for a cease-fire, and its connivance with Israel's excessive military actions in Gaza will exacerbate the humanitarian crisis.The United Saudi Arabia Emirates and China called for an emergency meeting of the UN on Monday after Israel expanded its ground operations into Gaza over the weekend, according to media reports.During the meeting, China Ambassador Zhang Jun, Permanent Representative of China to the UN, said that the Middle East peace process is on the brink of collapse and at this juncture, silence means acquiescence and inaction is tantamount to a green light.China solemnly calls on parties of the conflict to cease all hostilities, disengage immediately, put in place a humanitarian truce, and make every effort to prevent the situation from escalating further, Zhang said, also calling on a certain major country with special influence on the parties concerned to put aside its self-interest and geopolitical considerations and make every effort to stop the war and restore peace.The core on whether a new resolution can be passed by the Council relies on how the US chooses to act. However, given that Israel's ground operations in Gaza are still in their early stages and have not yet achieved their strategic objective, the US may not abandon its prior biased backing of Israel at the Council, Liu Zhongmin, a professor at the Middle East Studies Institute of Shanghai International Studies University, told the Global Times.Since 1945, a total of 34 UN draft resolutions related to the Israel-Palestine issue have been vetoed by the US. The majority of these resolutions were drafted to provide a framework for peace in the decades-long Israel-Palestine conflict, according to Al Jazeera.Liu noted that in recent years, disputes between powerful nations have spilled over into the UN, making it challenging for the UN to carry out its responsibilities on several highly contentious matters, most notably the Palestine-Israel dispute. The US' biased backing of Israel has come under growing fire both domestically and internationally with many criticizing that the US bears responsibility for the bloodshed in Gaza. As long as the US continues its one-sided support to Israel and rejects calls for a cease-fire, its ""leadership"" and reputation will be called into severe doubt, some analysts noted.At least 8,306 Palestine have been killed in Gaza in Israel attacks since October 7 and more than 1,400 people have been killed in Israel, media reported on Tuesday. The number of casualties in Gaza will increase when Israel's second phase of ground operations is carried out, analysts warned.The growing death toll is the accumulation of hostility. Israel would also be put in a more challenging position because, although it might be able to destroy Hamas temporarily, it cannot make it disappear forever. Regardless of its goals for Gaza's governance, it will never get rid of threats from Hamas or put a stop to its battle with the Palestine, Liu said. It would be a complete tragedy for the people of Gaza and a failure of global governance if the US' veto power causes another UN resolution fail, even amid the current mounting pressure for a cease-fire from the international community, Liu said. Four resolutions were rejected in the 15-member UN, with the US the sole Council member to veto the Brazil-drafted resolution on October 18. On Friday, with a recorded vote of 121 in favor to 14 against, with 44 abstentions, the UN adopted a resolution demanding a humanitarian truce in the Gaza. However, UN resolutions are legally binding, while assembly resolutions are not.China Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin on Tuesday called on relevant parties to implement the UN resolution, institute a cease-fire and a halt to the violence and prevent the situation from deteriorating to avoid an even worse humanitarian crisis. History has proved that violence cannot bring long-lasting peace and using violence to stop violence will only end in a vicious cycle. The solution for the Palestine issue is to implement the two-state solution, Wang said, noting that China will continue to make unremitting efforts to push for a comprehensive, just, and lasting solution to the Palestine issue.",CHINA,POLITICS,"People conduct rescue work among the rubble of buildings destroyed in Israeli airstrikes in the southern Gaza Strip city of Rafah, Oct. 29, 2023.

429,China offers emergency aid to more than 70 countries in past decade: senior official,Global Times,2023-10-31," China has provided more than 1,000 cases of emergency assistance to more than 70 countries in the past decade, Luo Zhaohui, chairman of the China International Development Cooperation Agency (CIDCA), said on Tuesday. For the latest example, China has provided timely humanitarian relief during the ongoing Israel-Palestine conflict, with additional material supplies on route, Luo told a press conference on Tuesday. China was also among the first group of countries to provide comprehensive relief for earthquake survivors in Turkey and Syria. China provided full assistance to Pakistan when the country was hit by unprecedented flooding last year. China has provided emergency food aid to more than 30 countries since 2022. Amid the global battle against the COVID-19 pandemic in the last three years, the CIDCA provided large quantities of anti-epidemic materials to 153 countries and 15 international organizations, while sending medical expert groups to 34 countries and providing more than 2.3 billion doses of vaccines to more than 110 countries and four international organizations. The high-quality construction of the China-proposed BRI (BRI) has played a vital role for China's efforts in promoting international development and cooperation, along with foreign aid. China has arranged more than 2,000 assistance projects with more than 120 BRI partner countries and established more than 80 economic and trade cooperation zones, which mobilized nearly $1 trillion in investment. It also trained more than 100,000 experts in various sectors and lifted nearly 40 million people out of poverty. In order to fully implement global development initiatives, more than 200 ""small but beautiful"" projects have been carried out in more than 60 countries.China has carried out bilateral and tripartite cooperation with more than 20 international organizations in sectors such as poverty reduction, food security and public health, and deployed more than 130 projects in nearly 60 countries, which benefited more than 30 million people. Luo said that China's international development cooperation and foreign aid have been evolving, with a further improved mechanism, expanded investment, upgraded international cooperation quality and strengthened supervision and evaluation for foreign aid.Global Times",SOURCE,ECONOMY,Pallets of medical supplies to be delivered to Chinese foreign aid medical teams in overseas countries and regions Courtesy of Shanghai Municipal Health Commission,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'China': ('LOC', 10), 'Palestine': ('LOC', 1), 'Turkey': ('LOC', 1), 'Syria': ('LOC', 1), 'Pakistan': ('LOC', 1), 'Luo Zhaohui': ('PER', 3), 'China International Development Cooperation Agency': ('ORG', 1), 'CIDCA': ('ORG', 2), 'Israel -': ('MISC', 1), 'COVID - 19': ('MISC', 1), 'BRI': ('MISC', 3)}"
430,Beijing Xiangshan Forum provides platform of communication for the world in turbulence,Yang Sheng,2023-10-31,"The three-day 10th Beijing Xiangshan Forum concluded on Tuesday, marking the  China-hosted international event for military diplomacy and security affairs out as probably the only platform currently able to receive attendees from Russia, Ukraine, Israel and Iran, especially after the outbreaks of the Ukraine crisis and the latest Palestine-Israel conflict. The Global Times was in attendance to interview delegates from all these countries to hear their voices about the ongoing crises.Delegates from countries that are suffering from military conflicts all thanked China for hosting such an event, which allowed them to communicate with other countries, because at forums or conferences hosted by other countries, some nations are excluded and isolated, leaving them with no opportunity to communicate with more people and openly exchange their views with each other. This world in turbulence desperately needs channels for communication, and by hosting the Beijing Xiangshan Forum, China provided a unique, non-biased, fair and neutral platform for everyone, including those embroiled in conflict or in tensions, so they are able to be enlightened by the wisdom of others and receive valuable information to better solve the crises and long-standing problems, said some attendees, including military delegates and scholars.China's Assistant Foreign Minister Nong Rong said in a speech at the forum on Tuesday that China would hold high-level conferences on the Global Security Initiative (GSI) at an appropriate time. Experts and many delegates reached by the Global Times at the forum said that the so-called rules-based international order has already caused at least two major geopolitical crises in EU and the Middle East, so it is time for the world to form a new order that can realize ""common security"" and ""lasting peace,"" which are the themes of the forum. They said the China-proposed GSI is an important contribution to this global demand.Unfortunately, during the three-day forum, attendees from the US military were reluctant to express their views openly although the organizer gave them the floor to speak, with observers saying that the US delegates did not want to be too high-profile and show too much support to a China-hosted forum of security affairs. They wanted to attend close-door conferences, and this proved that Washington was curious about the forum, but not confident enough to share its thoughts with the international community, especially to countries that are in disagreement or that have tensions with the US, or are being suppressed and bullied by the US.Giving voice to multiple parties  Senior Colonel Zhao Xiaozhuo, deputy director of the Beijing Xiangshan Forum Secretariat, told the Global Times that China has made and is continuing to make efforts to mediate conflicts around the globe, and the case of reconciliation between Saudi Arabia and Iran is significant proof of this. The forum is an important part of China's mediation efforts. ""We invited the parties in conflict, as well as the interest-involved parties, to talk about the issue together,"" Zhao said, adding that in a panel discussion about Middle East affairs on Monday, delegates from Israel and Iran had direct discussions. At other international forums, it is rare that Israelis can meet with delegates from Muslim countries, especially Iran.""Having communication is the first step toward seeking solutions. China will play a greater role in the Middle East in the future,"" Zhao said. Carice Witte, founder and executive director of SIGNAL (Sino-Israel Global Network & Academic Leadership), an Israel policy organization that specializes in China-Israel relations, told the Global Times that ""I am an old friend to this forum. The Beijing Xiangshan forum is one of the best in the world, because it brings together people from all over the world and someone like me from Israel, who does not have a chance to meet with many people from Muslim states. It is an excellent opportunity for communication and dialogue.""Witte said she had a long discussion with attendees from Afghanistan and Pakistan, adding they can build friendships as normal people do, and they can listen to each other and understand each other. ""That brings a lot of hope for what our governments might do in the future,"" Witte said.She said the Pakistani interlocutor, in general, was ""being harsh"" on Israel and ""leaning toward the Palestine,"" but there was a lot of openness to hearing about her personal experience and the difficulties that her family has suffered with the attacks by Hamas.On the colleague from Afghanistan, Witte said ""he gave me a number of thoughts and ideas"" based on his experience in Afghanistan about how to deal with the similar challenges on ethnical and sectarian problems, and this is helpful for her. She will bring these back to Israel and help Israel to better deal with Palestine in the future.Seyed Hamzeh Safavi, director of Institute for Islamic World Futures Studies in Iran, has given many media interviews during the forum, which proves the importance of voices from Iran. Safavi is the Iran scholar who talked to Witte in a panel discussion on Monday. Safavi highly praised the value of the Beijing Xiangshan Forum. He told the Global Times that ""I have never seen a big conference like this,"" with so many delegates, including senior officials, high-ranking military commanders and officers, intellectuals and researchers from so many countries, and they can talk to each other freely, so ""it was very useful.""Safavi noted that China is playing significant role in the Middle East. ""China's mediation between Iran and Saudi Arabia was a very good example. The Middle East always suffers from the third party's intervention. But in history, I think this was a first step and the first example for a foreign power to play a very good role between Iran and Saudi Arabia. Thanks to the China effort for that."" However, it is important to point out that Tehran and Riyadh wanted to shake hands before China's mediation, Safavi said. The two countries had reached the idea that ""we cannot continue our problem. It's better to end it and shake hands,"" and then ""They came to this maturity.""""Unfortunately, nowadays, I do not see this maturity from to the Israel side."" Seeking fair order  Another ongoing conflict of great concern to the international community is the Ukraine crisis, and both Russia and Ukraine sent delegates to the Beijing Xiangshan Forum. This is probably the only international event of its nature that can welcome attendees from both countries.A member of the Ukraine delegation who asked for anonymity said that China is a powerful country with a huge international influence, as significant as the US, and if China wants to play a role to help solve the Ukraine crisis, it can bring significant change to the current situation.Evgeny Buzhinsky, a retired lieutenant general and chairman of PIR Center, a leading Russia NGO that specializes in the study of nuclear nonproliferation, disarmament, and global security issues, told the Global Times that negotiations with Ukraine at this moment are unlikely because the two sides cannot agree on the conditions for peace talks.  The anonymous Ukraine delegate expressed a similar attitude toward Russia.  The wars in Ukraine and the Middle East prove that the international order that was dominated by the US-led West is unreliable, unstable, and is collapsing, and this is the reason why more and more geo-political crises have occurred, said experts. If the US had kept its promise and not pushed military deployments to the border of Russia via NATO expansion and hyped an anti-Russia color revolution in Ukraine, maybe the Ukraine conflict would not have happened in the first place, and on the Palestine-Israel issue, if the US' stance on the two-state solution had remained consistent and it had not tolerated Israel's provocations and harm against Palestine in past decades, the latest conflict could have be avoided, analysts noted.    Zhang Weiwei, director of the China Institute at Fudan University, told the Global Times that the world can no longer rely on the US-dominated ""rules-based order"" because the facts prove that the rules the US champions are not reliable. Times have changed, and the US needs to better understand that the right to development and the concern of security among others should be respected. Some of those countries will fight when they have not been treated fairly or get bullied, because they no longer believe there is a reliable order able to protect them, analysts said.  The China-proposed initiatives, including the Global Development Initiative, the Global Security Initiative and the Global Civilization Initiative, as well as the BRI are based on the idea of building a community of shared future for mankind, Zhang said, noting that these values reflect respect for every country. It is about ""you are among us and we are among you,"" he said.The Global Security Initiative is China's contribution to a new international order, said some foreign attendees. Buzhinsky said the new international order will be based on international laws, not ""rules"" set by the US and its allies. Safavi said the new international order should not be one-sided, as on the Middle East issue, the US stands only with Israel, but no one has said China is backing Israel or Palestine, so the order must be fair and non-biased. In terms of this, the China-proposed initiatives are better than the US-claimed order, and the role that China plays is also better than the US one, he said.",CHINA,DIPLOMACY,"China's Assistant Foreign Minister Nong Rong delivered a speech at the 10th Beijing Xiangshan Forum on October 31, 2023.

431,GSI supported by more than 100 nations and organizations; high-level GSI event expected: senior diplomat,GT staff reporters,2023-10-31,"Global Security Initiative (GSI) has been supported and commended by more than 100 countries and international organizations since it was put forward by China, and has been included in numerous bilateral and multilateral documents on China's interaction and cooperation with other countries and international organizations, said Nong Rong, the assistant foreign minister, noting that China will hold a high-level event on the theme of GSI at an appropriate time. Nong made above remarks during his speech at an activity marking the 10th Beijing Xiangshan Forum on Tuesday. He outlined the progress made by China over the past year in promoting the implementation of the GSI in terms of participation in multilateral security cooperation, promoting the political settlement of hot-spot issues, carrying out cooperation in the field of non-traditional security, and promoting the improvement of the platform and mechanism for international security exchanges and cooperation. The GSI was first proposed by China President Xi Jinping during his keynote speech at the opening ceremony of the Boao Forum for Asia Annual Conference 2022 in South China's Hainan Province on April 21, 2022. The initiative stresses a commitment to the vision of common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security and to reject a Cold War mentality, group politics and bloc confrontation. In his speech, Nong said that the concept of GSI has three distinctive features: it emphasizes common security, openness and inclusiveness, and pragmatic cooperation. GSI upholds the principle of indivisibility of security and advocates that members of the international community view global security issues from a more comprehensive and integrated perspective, and guard international common security with a stronger sense of responsibility and mission… GSI also advocates joint consultation, instead of engaging in a closed ""small bloc,"" said Nong. According to Nong, the GSI Concept Paper proposes 20 key directions for cooperation, including traditional security areas such as promoting political solutions to international and regional hotspot issues, peacekeeping operations under the framework of the UN, safeguarding the nuclear non-proliferation regime and the arms control process for conventional weapons, as well as non-traditional security areas such as climate change, information, biology, outer space, artificial intelligence and public health. It demonstrates China's willingness to join hands with all parties and to cooperate in addressing the various security risks and challenges facing humankind, Nong added. He noted that China leads among the permanent members of the UN in contributing peacekeepers, with over 2,200 China officers and soldiers actively engaged in eight peacekeeping mission areas.The China official also detailed Beijing's efforts to promote the political settlement of hotspot issues. China has issued position documents on the political settlement of the Ukraine crisis and on the Afghan issue, standing firmly on the side of peace, and has successfully brokered reconciliation between Saudi Arabia and Iran, thus contributing to the efforts of regional countries to resolve contradictions and differences through dialogue and consultation, said Nong. ""Since the outbreak of the latest Palestinian-Israeli Conflict, China has actively communicated and coordinated with all relevant parties, dispatched special envoys to visit regional countries and provided humanitarian assistance to Palestine at the first opportunity to push for the situation to cool down, stop the war from expanding, avert a humanitarian catastrophe and create conditions for a political settlement, he noted. According to the senior diplomat, China will continue to engage in various forms of dialogues and exchanges with all parties on global security issues, and opposes the use of ideology to create small blocs and incite division and confrontation. China will organize high-level events with GSI as the theme at an appropriate time, strengthen conceptual exchanges with all parties, deepen policy communication, and further forge a consensus on cooperation in the international community to address challenges and maintain common security, Nong added.",CHINA,DIPLOMACY,"China's Assistant Foreign Minister Nong Rong delivered a speech at the 10th Beijing Xiangshan Forum on October 31, 2023.

433,"China to continue providing assistance to UN agency for Palestine refugees, improving humanitarian situation in Middle East: Chinese special envoy",Global Times,2023-10-30,"China has consistently supported the work of the UN (UN), and is willing to continue providing assistance within its capacity to the agency, while seeking to promote the international community's increased assistance to Palestine through UN, further improving the humanitarian situation in Palestine, said Special Envoy of the China Government on the Middle East Issue Zhai Jun on Sunday in the Amman, capital of Jordan.Zhai made the remarks when meeting with the UN Commissioner-General Philippe Lazzarini. The two exchanged views on the conflict.Zhai said that the tense situation between Israel and Palestine continues to escalate, resulting in a large number of civilian casualties and a severe unfolding humanitarian crisis, which deeply concerns China. China expresses profound condolences to the victims of the conflict, including those from UN agencies. The immediate priority is to achieve an immediate ceasefire and cessation of hostilities, making every effort to protect civilians and avoid causing a more serious humanitarian disaster.Lazzarini said that the UN commends China for providing emergency humanitarian assistance to Gaza since the outbreak of the Israel-Palestine conflict. He expressed that the current situation in Gaza continues to deteriorate, with a severe humanitarian crisis that is spilling over into neighboring countries. The international community should make joint efforts to promote an immediate ceasefire between the parties to the conflict, allowing more humanitarian aid to enter Gaza and alleviate the suffering of the Palestine people. Lazzarini stated that UN regards China as an important partner and appreciates China's long-term political support and financial assistance to the agency. The UN is willing to strengthen cooperation with China to quickly alleviate the humanitarian crisis in Gaza.UN agencies warned on October 24 that civilians in the Gaza were going through a catastrophic situation and called on all actors to provide sufficient humanitarian assistance to avert a further deterioration.According to the CNN on Monday, the number of people killed on Gaza since October 7 has risen to 7,950, the Health Ministry in Ramallah said. Nearly three-quarters (73 percent) of those killed are from vulnerable populations, including children, women and elderly people, according to the ministry's report. More than 20,000 people have been injured, the ministry noted.On Saturday, the UN voted overwhelmingly in favor of a resolution calling for an immediate humanitarian truce in Gaza, and China voted for and co-sponsored the resolution. Commenting on resolution, Wang Wenbin, a spokesperson for the China Foreign Ministry, said at a press conference on Monday that since the escalation of the Israel-Palestine conflict, China has all along called for a ceasefire and cessation of fighting, the protection of civilians, the opening of humanitarian relief corridors, the avoidance of greater humanitarian disasters. China has played an active and constructive role in promoting a comprehensive, just and lasting settlement of the Palestine issue.The resolution was overwhelmingly passed by the UN, reflecting the strong international demand for a ceasefire and an end to the war, as well as the prevailing sentiment on the issue of war and nuclear proliferation, Wang said.The US, which has failed to act as an impartial mediator, has stood on the opposite side of the rest of the world by pledging funds to Israel amid rising global unease and dissatisfaction over its one-sided support for the country. However, China's special envoy on Middle East affairs has been busy working with the international community to work on a ceasefire and buy more time for humanitarian assistance.At the invitation of the Egypt government, Zhai attended a summit attended by world leaders including the Palestine President, Jordanian King and UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres to discuss the escalating of the conflict, which was held in Cairo earlier this month. On Thursday, Zhai said that to restart talks for peace between Palestine and Israel on the basis of the two-state solution is the only realistic way out to break the vicious cycle of the Palestine-Israel conflict, when meeting with Deputy Foreign Minister of Saudi Arabia Waleed Al-Khuraiji during his visit to Saudi Arabia. When asked whether Special Envoy of China Government to the Middle East Issue Zhai Jun plans to attend other meetings related to the Israel-Palestine conflict in the region this week, Wang said that China firmly supports anything that is conducive to promoting dialogue, achieving ceasefire and restoring peace. China will do everything it can to help implement the two-state solution and promote a comprehensive, just and lasting settlement of the Palestine issue. We will continue to make unremitting efforts to this end together with the international community.Also on Thursday, the China International Development Cooperation Agency announced it would provide another 15 million yuan ($2.05 million) in emergency humanitarian supplies to the Gaza to help those affected by the conflict, given the deteriorating humanitarian situation. The China government recently provided $1 million in cash assistance through the Palestine National Authority and the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East.Global Times",CHINA,POLITICS,Special Envoy of the Chinese Government on the Middle East Issue Zhai Jun (right) and the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees Commissioner-General Philippe Lazzarini Photo: Chinese Foreign Ministry,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'China': ('LOC', 10), 'Palestine': ('LOC', 5), 'Middle East': ('LOC', 1), 'Amman': ('LOC', 1), 'Jordan': ('LOC', 1), 'Israel': ('LOC', 2), 'Gaza': ('LOC', 7), 'Ramallah': ('LOC', 1), 'UN': ('ORG', 10), 'CNN': ('ORG', 1), 'Zhai Jun': ('PER', 3), 'Philippe Lazzarini': ('PER', 3)}"
434,China must be prepared for protracted struggle with the US,Global Times,2023-10-30,"00
Editor's Note: With the APEC leaders' meeting just around the corner, increasing high-level interactions between China and the US signal that the US wants its relations with China to stabilize and even improve. Even if there's a new balloon incident, bilateral ties will not be blown off course again, George Yeo (Yeo), former Singaporean minister of foreign affairs, told Global Times (Global Times) reporters Li Aixin and Bai Yunyi in an exclusive interview during his recent tour in Beijing. Yeo also stressed that China must be prepared for a period of protracted struggle with the US. This is because, at least for now, the US does not trust China. But how does China get prepared? ""China knows what to do,"" Yeo said.Global Times: With the increasing high-level interactions between China and the US, as well as the upcoming APEC meeting, do you think there may be changes in China-US relations in the near future? Yeo: In the short term, I believe the US wants bilateral relations with China to stabilize, perhaps even to improve a little bit. There's an expectation that President Xi Jinping will meet President Joe Biden in San Francisco, because a lot of preparatory work has been done.They had a good meeting in Bali, Indonesia, one year ago, which lasted over three hours. Unfortunately, the consensus reached was derailed by the balloon incident. The fact that the balloon incident could derail a broad agreement shows how fragile it was. I believe for this coming meeting, much more preparations have already been made. So even if there's a new balloon incident, bilateral ties will not be blown off course because both sides have interacted with one another much more deeply now. The point is, the US, in the short term, doesn't want bilateral relations to get worse. This is partly because the war in Ukraine is not making much progress from the US side. There is also concern about a serious economic downturn, and the US needs to cooperate with China. Without open channels, if a crisis arises, there may be no time to reach a mutual understanding on how to conceptually address economic challenges. I think these are the two main reasons why the US wants to improve its relations with China to a certain degree.Global Times: From a long-term perspective, where do you think the relationship is headed?Yeo: In the longer term, China-US relations will remain tense and difficult. This trial of strength between the two will continue for a while, because China is very likely to become the world's largest economy. The US feels that its dominance in the world is threatened by China, and it's hard for US to accept this. They even fear that China will want to replace or displace the US as No.1 in the world. China said repeatedly that it has no such ambition, but the US doesn't quite believe China. The US thinks that once China becomes economically strong and powerful, it will want to do what the West powers did when they became strong and powerful. In this, I believe they don't understand China history and China civilization enough. China has to be patient. There has to be a period of time where both sides test each other before a more stable position crystallizes. China must be prepared for a period of protracted struggle with the US. US politics also goes through periodic changes. There are elections all the time. It's easy for emotions against China to become inflamed, putting pressure on all candidates to take certain positions. Global Times: Do you have any advice on how China could communicate and interact with a US that does not want to believe China?Yeo: It's not for me to give advice to China. China knows what to do. China will not escalate (tension). But at the same time, it does not want its reaction to be mistaken as weakness. It has to show firmness. At the same time, China must be able to explain its position to the China people who are also judging their own government and wanting their own government to be strong and not weak. This is the balance that has to be struck. Global Times: You have been discussing the coming multipolar world. What roles do you think China and the US can play in this future world? Yeo: The world is becoming multipolar. The US resists it because it's used to being dominant and preeminent in the world. Many of the institutions that now enable us to communicate, travel and trade freely were shaped by the US after WWII. The US is finding that some of these institutions are no longer acting in its national interest. As a result of, we see the US weaponizing some of these institutions, and weaponizing the long-established practices. I would say that the US is now in a defensive position. It feels that it's got to protect its own interests.China should take a constructive attitude to the reform of institutions like the WTO and it's important to make the US continue to feel that it gains by working within them rather than working outside them. 

Global Times: The Xiangshan Forum is being held in Beijing to discuss security cooperation. How do you view China's global security vision and its response to regional conflicts?Yeo: It is important for China and US' defense establishments and for the two armed forces to be able to communicate with one another in order to avoid accidents. China has been predictably cautious in its response to distant conflicts. Between Russia and Ukraine, China has triangulated very carefully. It doesn't want Russia to collapse, because that would not be in China's interests. At the same time, it doesn't want to supply weapons, because that's taking sides. China has been telling various parties: I don't want to be involved in your war, but one day when reconstruction is needed, we will be there to help. China is a peacemaker, not a troublemaker in the Russia-Ukraine conflict. It's the same with the Israel-Palestine conflict. China has taken a clear position condemning what Hamas has done but is sympathetic to the injustices suffered by the Palestine people over decades. At the same time, it is telling Israel that China is not an opponent. That was what China's permanent representative in the UN said recently, in response to Israel criticism. He said, it is wrong to treat China as an opponent. China has long upheld a two-state solution and pays equal importance to the security concerns and legitimate rights of both Israel and Palestine.China has been very careful not to take sides unnecessarily and to triangulate as carefully as possible. We should not add fuel to the fire. We should be peacemakers, not troublemakers. However, you have to expect that when taking a balanced position, both sides may be unhappy with you at first, because each side wants you to be on its side. But over time, when the protagonists are exhausted by war, by violence, they will appreciate China's moderate position. Global Times: How do you view the US response? Yeo: The US is caught in a difficult position. It has a longstanding relationship with Israel. Israel has also become part of US domestic politics. Elections are coming up, so the US position is partly conditioned by electoral considerations. Global Times: Tensions between China and the Philippines have been on the rise lately. Some observers believe the US is inciting the Philippines to trigger an Asia proxy war. What's your take on the possibility of the South China Sea becoming the next flashpoint? Yeo: The current tension over Ren'ai Reef, or what the Filipinos call Second Thomas Shoal, is the result of the Philippines beaching an old ship with a small crew on an atoll which was controlled by China some years ago. This is the cause of the current tension. China doesn't want to remove the hulk forcefully. The hulk is rusting and breaking up. The crew there needs to be fed and provided with water. China is allowing food and water, but not allowing the hulk to be repaired, hoping that it will disintegrate and the problem will solve itself. I hope this tension will not get out of control. It is a small matter which should not be allowed to become big. The US predictably supports the Philippines. I only hope that US' support does not encourage the Philippines to take unnecessary risks, because China would then be forced to react. It's critical that at a political level, China and the Philippines meet and talk and keep the problem in proportion. Global Times: Some observers say the US power may be overstretched as conflicts worldwide intensify. Do you think the Russia-Ukraine conflict and Israel-Palestine conflict will increase or decrease the risk of a conflict erupting across the Taiwan Straits? Yeo: What has happened in Palestine has taken the international limelight away from Ukraine to the Middle East. This is to Ukraine's disadvantage, because Ukraine cannot sustain this war by itself. It needs West help.Both the Ukraine war and the problem of Palestine have taken away attention from the Taiwan Straits, because every leader has limited resources and only so much nervous energy. It is difficult enough to devote time and energy to two crisis areas. The fact that US-China relations have taken a slight turn for the better will help reduce tension across the Taiwan Straits.Global Times: What do you think other countries can do to ease the tensions between China and US? Yeo: EU can play a very important role. If China behaves excessively, EU should lean a little to the US. This will then restrain China. In the same way, if the US behaves in an unreasonable way, EU should be a little away from the US and thus restrain its actions. EU can play a critical balancing role to maintain peace and stability in the world. ASEAN refuses to take sides when our own interests are not directly affected, because we see no benefits in taking sides. ASEAN wants to remain neutral and friendly to all powers, not only to China and the US, but also to India, EU, Japan and others. If any major power tries to bully ASEAN, we will shift in other directions. This will stop the bullying. This has always been ASEAN's strategy, which is to be dynamically balanced among the big powers and to be useful to all of them. So Wang Daohan, (then head of the mainland's Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits), and Koo Chen-fu (then chairman of the Taiwan-based Straits Exchange Foundation) met for the first time in Singapore. The talk between President Xi Jinping and former Taiwan island leader Ma Ying-jeou was also held in Singapore. A few years ago, then US President Donald Trump met with North Korean leader Kim Jong-UN in Singapore and after that in Hanoi.Many countries meet regularly at the ASEAN regional forum. Everybody sits around the ASEAN table. ASEAN is friendly to everybody, and everybody feels comfortable and welcomed in ASEAN. That was why the G20 summit in Bali last year was so successful.Global Times: Will Singapore play a more active role as mediator? Yeo: Singapore's role is very consistent. We are a peacemaker, we are never a troublemaker. We want the major powers to talk, to compromise, because this will conduce peace and is in our own interest. We derive no benefits from big power conflicts. In fact, we feel extremely uncomfortable if our friends are quarreling with one another. We encourage them to be courteous and reasonable when they visit us in ASEAN. Global Times: At present, China is also facing challenges like economic growth slowdown. What's your view on China's domestic political economic circumstances? Yeo: I don't think China's current economic slowdown is very serious. The country is still adjusting to the end of COVID. The government has decided that the way in which the real estate sector was over invested was not healthy. Too many people were buying houses and apartments as a one-way bet to make money. That resulted in excessive deployment of economic resources to real estate. By stopping it, the government has to be mindful of the systemic effects, because real estate is on every company's balance sheet. China also has an unemployment problem, but China has a lot of policy, flexibility. China did not have to print money during COVID. In fact, much of the money printed by other countries was collected by China. Financially, the China government is in a strong position. In contrast to other major economies, interest rates in China are still trending down, which means that the government has a lot of fiscal room to address the economic downturn. I am therefore cautiously optimistic about the China economy. That is good for the entire world.",OPINION,VIEWPOINT,George Yeo Photo: Yu Jiayin/GT,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'APEC': ('ORG', 2), 'Global Times': ('ORG', 3), 'China': ('LOC', 12), 'US': ('LOC', 12), 'Beijing': ('LOC', 1), 'San Francisco': ('LOC', 1), 'Bali': ('LOC', 1), 'Indonesia': ('LOC', 1), 'Ukraine': ('LOC', 1), 'George Yeo': ('PER', 4), 'Li Aixin': ('PER', 1), 'Bai Yunyi': ('PER', 1), 'Ye': ('PER', 1), 'Xi Jinping': ('PER', 1), 'Joe Biden': ('PER', 1), 'Singaporean': ('MISC', 1)}"
435,US altering lopsided support for Israel due to mounting pressure; more efforts urged for cease-fire before catastrophic humanitarian crisis worsens,GT staff reporters,2023-10-30,"As US President Joe Biden told Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu Netanyahuthat Israel's attack in Gaza should be consistent with international humanitarian law that prioritizes the protection of civilians, the US came under intense pressure to modify its one-sided support for Israel due to the dire and worsening humanitarian crisis in Gaza as well as strong pressure from the Muslim community and international community, analysts said. Israel may decide to send ground forces into Gaza to destroy Hamas instead of forcing out all Palestine from Gaza to gain complete control of the place, but the death toll would inevitably rise. While Israel could prevail in armed conflict, analysts predicted that it could not win diplomatically or politically. They urged the international community -especially the US - to intensify efforts to support a cease-fire in order to avert a humanitarian crisis before the humanitarian catastrophe worsened. In a White House statement on Sunday, US President Joe Biden stated that Israel needs to carry out its attack against Hamas in Gaza ""in a manner consistent with international humanitarian law that prioritizes the protection of civilians,"" after speaking to Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. This was the first call between the two leaders since the Israel military expanded its ground operation in Gaza late Friday, media reported.In contrast to its earlier lopsided support for Israel, the Joe Biden administration's approach to the Palestine-Israel issue has undergone notable adjustments. The primary causes are the worsening humanitarian crisis and the UN's passage of the cease-fire resolution, which has forced the US to realize that it would lose the support of the international community, particularly the Islamic world, if it continues to blindly defend Israel, Sun Degang, director of the Center for Middle Eastern Studies at Fudan University, told the Global Times on Monday.On Friday, with a recorded vote of 121 in favor to 14 against, with 44 abstentions, the UN adopted a resolution demanding a humanitarian truce in the Gaza, while the US, Israel and a few other countries voted against. Israel Foreign Minister Eli Cohen said Saturday that his country ""outright"" rejected the resolution, according to media reports. There is mounting pressure worldwide for a humanitarian cease-fire as the death toll in Gaza continues to rise. More than 8,000 Palestine, including at least 3,300 children, have been killed, according to the Health Ministry in Gaza. As Israel's largest military aid provider, the US has been accused of bearing responsibility for Israel's actions in Gaza. Meanwhile, Joe Biden is also facing pressure within the US and even from within his own Democratic Party to call for a cease-fire.While Joe Biden is attempting to mitigate the harm that Israel's present military operation in Gaza is causing to its global leadership and Middle East policy, Israel wants to maintain close ties with the US, said Sun. Israel's military actions in Gaza are motivated by its interests in the area, but US policies are designed to uphold US hegemony worldwide. Pressure from the international community and the Saudi Arabia nations' condemnation of Israel have made the US less inclined to pull the chestnuts out of the fire for Israel, the expert noted. More Saudi Arabia countries, including the United Saudi Arabia Emirates, Jordan, Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, Oman, Qatar, Kuwait, Egypt and Morocco, have condemned the targeting of civilians and ""flagrant violations of international law"" in Gaza, which has come under heavy Israel bombardment.Although Israel has not said it openly, it previously intended to drive out all Palestine from Gaza and take complete control of the area, but may now seek to destroy Hamas and then withdraw from Gaza in response to the increasing pressure, particularly from the US, analysts said. The humanitarian situation will worsen as a result of the ongoing military operations in Gaza, which would result in an increase in fatalities, said Sun. Since the start of this round of fighting on October 7, the international community's sentiments toward Israel have shifted from sympathy to more complicated feelings, with more people voicing worries about the humanitarian situation brought on by Israel's excessive military activities in Gaza. Many countries have seen spikes in anti-Semitic incidents, leading to growing concerns over hate crimes. Some analysts warned that while the Netanyahu administration's goal of complete military domination would be successful in combat terms, it would not be successful in terms of politics or diplomacy. They called for increased international efforts to promote a truce before more hostilities took place.",CHINA,DIPLOMACY,"People are seen among the rubble of buildings destroyed in Israeli airstrikes in the southern Gaza Strip city of Rafah, Oct. 29, 2023. The death toll of Palestinians from Israeli strikes on the Gaza Strip rose to 8,005, including 3,342 children, the Hamas-run Health Ministry said on Sunday.So far, more than 20,000 Palestinians have been injured since the fighting broke out, the ministry said in a statement.

436,US and Israel should approach international criticism rationally,Global Times,2023-10-30,"As Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Saturday that Israel is now ""heading into the second stage of the war,"" the Israel troops expanded their ground operations in the Gaza. The stepped-up attacks came despite a mounting international outcry for a ""humanitarian pause"" to allow aid in.The current ground operations have evidently resulted in excessive casualties, and with the situation in Gaza deteriorating further, a humanitarian disaster in the Gaza is poised to escalate. Continuous casualties will only breed more hatred. Strategically, this is not merely a military test for Israel but also a test of wisdom. Excessive actions will cause Israel to lose the sympathy gained due to Hamas' attacks. Likewise, for the US, this is not merely a military test, but also a test of conscience. This traditional conflict in the international arena has lasted half a century and is confined to a very small region. However, the current situation has turned into a humanitarian catastrophe. Militarily, this is an entirely unequal confrontation. One side is a state apparatus, the other side consists of civilians. If the US continues to support Israel in killings of innocent civilians, it will only make more countries realize that the US and Israel represent international hegemony and power politics.West countries also have internal divisions over the Israel-Palestine conflict. On Friday, the UNGA held an emergency special session and adopted a Gaza resolution with 120 votes in favor. Major EU countries, including Spain, France, Germany, the UK, and Australia, either supported or abstained. Countries that truly support the US and Israel in taking the so-called self-defense military action are very few. The profound division in West society reflects the increasingly unpopular hegemonic actions of the US in the international community.Recently, several US media outlets reported that ""antisemitic comments"" have increased across China social media, claiming that China might see the spread of antisemitic sentiment as well as hostility toward the US over the conflict as ""geopolitically useful."" US media, in pursuit of their own interests, have always been inclined to vilify China in any matter, and this instance is no exception. In recent years, China has been actively engaged in mediating and resolving various regional conflicts, such as facilitating the Saudi Arabia-Iran agreement to restore ties. However, China's proactive advocacy for peace and participation in peace processes have made the US and a few other countries uneasy; they are unwilling to see China exerting influence in certain regions and fear the expansion of China's influence. Consequently, they attempt to undermine China's efforts and cast aspersions on the actions of the China government. The criticism of Israel's excessive use of force in China public opinion is primarily based on morality. However, some West media outlets have labeled the China internet discourse as ""antisemitic,"" which is clearly an unjust accusation. There is absolutely no foundation for the formation of ""antisemitism"" as an ideology in China. China prioritizes regional peace and opposes the slaughter of civilians by a state apparatus. The mainstream voices on China internet platforms echo this sentiment. China law explicitly prohibits the dissemination of extremist, hateful, and violence-inciting content on the internet. The China people possess discerning judgment. They're able to differentiate between right and wrong, and distinguish those who advocate for peace and justice from those who represent war and malevolence. Actions that violate international law, humanitarian laws, and result in significant humanitarian crises are not just opposed by the China populace but also by all fair-minded people around the world.",OPINION,OBSERVER,A ruthless stand.

437,China urges efforts to eliminate war chaos at Beijing Xiangshan Forum,Liu Xuanzun,2023-10-30,"The three-day 10th Beijing Xiangshan Forum entered its second day on Monday with a keynote speech delivered by General Zhang Youxia, Vice Chairman of the Central Military Commission, who invited all parties to implement the Global Security Initiative to achieve the theme of the forum, ""Common Security, Lasting Peace,"" and urged countries to make efforts to eliminate war chaos amid the Russia-Ukraine and the Palestine-Israel conflicts. The China military expects all parties to make joint efforts to continuously deepen security mutual-trust and optimize security architecture, enhance security governance together, promote security cooperation pragmatically and implement the Global Development Initiative, the Global Security Initiative and the Global Civilization Initiative, build a global community of shared future and inject more certainty, stability and positive energy into a tumultuous and intertwined world, Zhang said.Humanity has entered the 21st century in which hegemony and Cold War mentality are greatly out of accord with the times and not winning people's hearts, as people with conscience from all over the world are expecting peace, development, cooperation and win-win, Zhang said.However, some countries insist on a zero-sum mentality in which one side must lose for the other to win, adhere to the law of the jungle, practice bloc politics and promote unilateralism that builds up walls, filling the world with the shadows of war and humanitarian disasters, Zhang said. ""If you are full of hostility, there will surely be competition everywhere. If you only care about your own benefits, all shall become your opponents. If you keep suppressing others, conflicts and wars around the world will definitely arise.""Against the background of the Russia-Ukraine and the Palestine-Israel conflicts, Zhang urged all countries to make efforts to eliminate war chaos, as he accused a certain country of intentionally creating turbulence, intervening in regional affairs, interfering in others' internal affairs and plotting color revolutions, as wherever this country goes, peace and tranquility stay away.""[Certain country] even sets up pegs everywhere and intentionally creates many geopolitical contradictions, pretending to be fair in stopping a fight but actually helping one side, making regional situations become complex and difficult to resolve. It also provides weapons and triggers proxy wars so it can reap the spoils of victory without lifting a finger,"" Zhang said.Zhang stressed that the China military will never tolerate and will be relentless against anyone who dares to split Taiwan from China in any way.The senior military leader pointed out that the China military is a firm force in safeguarding world peace and defending territorial sovereignty.To achieve ""Common Security, Lasting Peace,"" China is willing to implement the Global Security Initiative together with all parties, and make efforts to build a friendly and peaceful new era far away from conflicts, Zhang said.

The first plenary session of the 10th Beijing Xiangshan Forum is held on October 30, 2023 with the focus on major countries' responsibility and global security cooperation. Photo: Leng Shumei/GTSong Zhongping, a China military expert and TV commentator, told the Global Times that the China-proposed Global Security Initiative is an international security view based on domestic security but also takes a broader view that allows countries to coexist peacefully.The Global Security Initiative is an important manifestation of building a global community of shared future, as it is also an international security view that avoids oppression of the weak and other forms of inequality, Song said.Lieutenant General He Lei, former vice president of the Academy of Military Sciences of the People's Liberation Army, told the Global Times during the forum on Monday that Zhang's keynote speech promoted and elaborated on the concept of building a global community of  shared future and the Global Security Initiative, as he reiterated China's independent and peaceful diplomatic policy, its strategic decision of walking the path of peaceful development, its national defense policy that is defensive in nature, and its military strategy of active defense.The keynote speech by Zhang also rejected Cold War mentality and bloc confrontation, as he made an in-depth analysis of the current international security situation, and expressed the China military's wish to develop friendly relations, enhance communications, build strategic mutual trust and jointly make positive efforts to safeguard peace and stability in the world, said He Lei.Lü Chao, an international affairs expert at the Liaoning Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times at the forum on Monday that at a time when the West is hyping up the ""China threat"" theory, the forum also served as a good opportunity to refute those claims.At this domestically hosted international security forum, China declared to the whole world its initiative for peaceful development, Lü said, noting that he expects positive feedback from the international community.Lü, who has attended many previous editions of the Beijing Xiangshan Forum, said that this year's event further stressed China and the international communities' joint development and joint efforts in achieving lasting peace.""What impressed me greatly were the speeches from representatives from Cambodia, Indonesia, Nigeria and other countries, because in other international conventions I seldom get the chance to hear from them. Their remarks are actually very close to China's ideas, so China's diplomacy really wins the hearts of others,"" Lü said.While the West is demonizing China, in fact everyone knows who is the real one that is threatening global peace, Lü said.

""We do not avoid hot topics, nor do we go around sensitive topics.""During the sessions discussing the Palestine-Israel conflict and the Russia-Ukraine conflict, parties involved in those conflicts remained objective and reasonable in their discussions, which is not easy considering conflicts are going on between them, Zhao said, noting that the forum is a platform that offers sides engaged in conflicts a chance to talk to each other.In all plenary and simultaneous sessions, there were a large number of representatives and experts who had come from developing countries.Zhao said that representatives from developing countries seldom get the chance to make themselves heard in international forums, particularly those with influence, so the Beijing Xiangshan Forum offers them an opportunity, and takes them into full consideration when arranging topics so that developing countries can raise their suggestions and claims.",CHINA,DIPLOMACY,"The first plenary session of the 10th Beijing Xiangshan Forum is held on October 30, 2023 with the focus on major countries' responsibility and global security cooperation.

438,Message delivered at Beijing Xiangshan Forum is worth pondering: Global Times editorial,Global Times,2023-10-30,"The 10th Beijing Xiangshan Forum kicked off on Sunday. As one of the most representative security forums in the world, it was held face-to-face again after four years and was highly anticipated by all parties. This is evident by the record number and level of representatives. In particular, a large number of representatives from developing countries attended the meeting, as well as representatives from conflicting parties, such as Russia and Ukraine, and Israel and Saudi Arabia countries. Against the background of constant conflicts and wars in various places and the turbulent international situation, it is obvious that all parties are here for security and peace. This shows that China's Global Security Initiative has been recognized and supported by more and more countries. This is also the essence of the theme of this year's Xiangshan Forum ""Common Security and Lasting Peace.""This year, the outside world has focused on China-US relations and the Taiwan question. The US Department of Defense sent a delegation to the Xiangshan Forum and the China military issued a stern warning on the Taiwan question, both of which have received widespread attention. Many people hope to find clues about the future direction of the situation. Frankly speaking, the two issues are highly related to each other. The Taiwan question is the central issue in China-US relations, and the same is true for the relationship between the China and US militaries. The most direct reason why the military interaction between the two sides has reached a low point is the US' political manipulation of the Taiwan question. The US itself is well aware of this.Zhang Youxia, vice chairman of the Central Military Commission, warned in his keynote speech on Monday that the China military will never tolerate and will be relentless against anyone who dares to split Taiwan from China in any way. This statement has elicited a significant response that is worthy of careful consideration by the international community. On China social media, phrases like ""never tolerate,"" and ""relentless against"" have gone viral. This is not the first time China has issued such a stern warning. On the contrary, it is one of the clearest statements China has made on various international occasions in recent years, and each time it has consistently garnered strong support from the China public. This scene is a strong signal in itself to external forces attempting to interfere in the Taiwan question, fully demonstrating the resolute determination of the entire China nation for achieving national reunification. Some US politicians who assess whether China will ""resolve the Taiwan question through the use of force"" based on calculating the so-called ""political gains and losses"" are fundamentally misguided, and the conclusions they reach are naturally off the mark.There have been some signs of warming in China-US relations recently, but when it comes to the Taiwan question, China's stance remains unchanged. This is not contradictory; it underscores the extreme importance of the Taiwan question to China, as it is at the core of China's core interests, and this red line can never change under any circumstances. The reason for repeatedly emphasizing this issue publicly is that some individuals continue to test the boundaries of this red line, trying to test China's bottom line. China is being candid and forthright about its true stance on the matter, which clearly indicates that there is no room for ""negotiation"" on matters of sovereignty. In this regard, any force willing to take risks should carefully weigh the consequences to avoid getting themselves into trouble.The psychological deterrence effect played by the China people and the China People's Liberation Army by repeatedly declaring and emphasizing their determination, will and ability to fight ""independence"" forces and promote reunification cannot be ignored. ""Do not say that you have not been forewarned."" China is playing a clear card and will never be soft on the separatist behavior of Taiwan ""independence"" forces. It is believed that not many people will be stupid enough to think that China is just talking. Anyone who has a certain understanding of China's style knows that China always acts as it says. If the China military will never tolerate, then it will definitely have the means and capabilities to not tolerate; if the China military says it will never be soft-handed, then it will definitely be prepared to not be soft-handed. This applies to both Taiwan ""independence forces"" and external interference forces.It is important to emphasize that China's stern warning is by no means a ""warlike statement"" but precisely a defense of peace. The current situation is that the US keeps pushing gunpowder into Taiwan and it is continuously increasing military deployments around China, and simultaneously promoting the narrative of ""China mainland's use of force against Taiwan."" This combination of actions raises doubts about whether Washington is genuinely preparing for a conflict that the world cannot afford. China's warnings issued on various occasions are like a bucket of cold water poured over the heads of those war enthusiasts in Washington. Only by extinguishing their unrealistic hopes can peace across the Taiwan Straits be achieved. This is also an important message of peace that the Xiangshan Forum conveys to the world.",OPINION,EDITORIAL,"Under the theme of ""Common Security, Lasting Peace,"" the 10th Beijing Xiangshan Forum is held in Beijing from October 29 to 31, 2023.

439,The Occident is heading for a disastrous accident,Jan Oberg,2023-10-29,"In civilization terms, war is a backward, primitive thing; it solves no conflicts and creates no security - only hate, which fuels more war. It's a system or structural evil - much more than a human evil. Equally primitive and uncultured is, of course, this type of black-and-white, simplified narrative: there is only one evil party - the Palestine and Hamas. The war has only one cause - Hamas' attack - and we in the West need neither history nor conflict analysis to understand anything.Furthermore, according to this narrative, we don't need to sympathize and empathize with innocent suffering human beings on all sides - only with one side. All that is needed is politically correct emotionalism and side-taking - regardless whether or not these two irrelevant tools are guaranteed to make everything worse and get more innocent people killed.The EU's top leader Ursula von der Leyen has the guts to declare that ""EU stands with Israel"" - but which ""EU""? And were you ever elected by ""EU"" or by the EU citizens to speak on their behalf, Madam? The indefatigable Irish for-peace EU MP, Clare Daly, made exactly that point, much more eloquently than I just did, on October 8 when she demanded that von der Leyen shut up because she doesn't represent ""EU"" at all.It has all become too easy to take stands. It's a display of intellectual and moral laziness: Condemnation requires no knowledge or complex understanding, but it speaks to the minds of kakistocrats. It's Kitsch politics! It actively promotes the death of thousands upon thousands on both sides, and it is fundamentally immoral because there were other ways of engaging in Middle East conflicts.In Ukraine, EU/NATO countries side with the underdog that has been invaded. In this war, it sides with Israel, the top dog. From another perspective, it is a huge blow to Israel and the US - a complete ""intelligence"" failure, if that is what it was. Allegedly, a fox would not be able to run through the border installations; Hamas did for hours. When Israel's occupation-to-extermination policy has run its course - no electricity, no food, no water, no fuel and no mercy, plus total ethnic cleansing and flattening of dwellings - the US/NATO/EU governments will have drowned it in a blood-drenched unsolvable moral dilemma of their own creation. They won't see it, and they'll never foresee it. They did not care about the consequences of their ""response"" to Hamas' attack - as despicable as it was, it was certainly not provoked. To cover up yet another West politico-moral disaster, the West knee-jerk reaction is, as usual, more weapons, no ceasefire, no mediation and no negotiations. Militarist thinking excludes diplomacy. We never make mistakes!Since the decision-makers in West capitals have lost on economic, political, cultural, diplomatic and moral power dimensions, there is only one approach left - as in all falling empires in history: Militarism. That is mass killing and ethnic cleansing. Kill the people instead of the problem that stands unsolved between the parties and causes the violence in the first place.What we are going to see in weeks and months to come in the Middle East will make the Srebrenica massacre in Bosnia and the war in Ukraine pale. West foreign policy can no longer be understood by rational analysis, political science or international relations thinking.We need concepts and theories from psychology, psychiatry and religion to understand the blame games, emotionalism, psycho-political projection, presumed innocence, denial, compulsive repetition, paranoia, scapegoating, revenge and aggression that get full blast in various blends in the policies of the US/NATO/EU countries.Therefore, for West foreign ministries and state-financed research and the mainstream media, it is no longer a priority to pursue conflict analysis, conflict-resolution, mediation, peacekeeping, negotiations and reconciliation.The Occident is heading for an accident. Its reservoirs of legitimacy, knowledge and ethics are even more depleted than its arsenals of weapons.The author is the director of the Sweden-based think tank Transnational Foundation for Peace & Future Research. opinion@globaltimes.com.cn",OPINION,VIEWPOINT,Illustration:Liu Xidan/ GT,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'Palestine': ('LOC', 1), 'West': ('LOC', 1), 'Israel': ('LOC', 4), 'Middle East': ('LOC', 1), 'Ukraine': ('LOC', 1), 'US': ('LOC', 2), 'Hamas': ('ORG', 3), 'EU': ('ORG', 9), 'NATO': ('ORG', 2), 'Ursula von der Leyen': ('PER', 1), 'Clare Daly': ('PER', 1), 'von der Leye': ('PER', 1), 'Irish': ('MISC', 1), 'Kitsch': ('MISC', 1)}"
440,"Beijing Xiangshan Forum kicks off, provides platform for 'communicating in a frank manner, better resolving questions'",GT staff reporters,2023-10-29,"The 10th Beijing Xiangshan Forum kicked off on Sunday with representatives from a record-breaking number of countries, regions and international organizations gathering in the China capital to attend the meeting themed ""Common Security, Lasting Peace.""Under the tensions of the current international security situation, the Beijing Xiangshan Forum provides all parties with a platform to talk in a frank manner that contributes to better communication, better understanding of each other's positions and better resolutions to questions, said foreign experts participating in the forum.Official delegations from more than 90 countries, regions and international organizations arrived at Beijing International Convention Center on Sunday for the three-day event.Present are more than 30 ministerial representatives and military chiefs, as well as representatives from international and regional organizations, as the numbers of participants and senior officials are both higher than in previous years, according to China's Ministry of National Defense.  Sunday featured high-end dialogues, a leading experts dialogue, a young military officers and scholars seminar and a symposium on Sun Tzu's Art of War, as well as a welcome dinner, while the opening ceremony is scheduled to be held on Monday.Four plenary sessions to be held on Monday and Tuesday will focus on Major Countries' Responsibility and Global Security Cooperation, the Role of Developing Countries in Global Security, Asia-Pacific Security Architecture: Present and Future, as well as Regional Security and Development: Goals and Roads.Eight simultaneous sessions on Monday will discuss Security Trend and Configuration of Security Situation in Northeast Asia, ASEAN Centrality in Regional Security Cooperation Architecture, New Security Architecture in the Middle East, Reconfiguring Peace in EU, Preventing and Managing Military Maritime Crisis, Nuclear Risk and Global Security, Artificial Intelligence Security, as well as Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Relief: International Military Cooperation.An official at China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs is scheduled to deliver a special speech on Tuesday.The event is expected to comprehensively implement the concept of a global community of a shared future, as the theme of ""Common Security, Lasting Peace"" reflects the core concept of the Global Security Initiative (GSI).The forum is an opportunity to start to hear more about the details on how effectively China wants to propose the implementation of the GSI, so that the participants in the forum can actually have an opportunity to reflect, and then start to think about how different countries can join and support the GSI, Alessio Patalano, Professor of War & Strategy in East Asia at the Department of War Studies, King's College London, told the Global Times among a group of media at the forum on Sunday.""We see at the moment, there are two significant conflicts, one in Eastern EU, the largest conflict between states since the end of the World War II, basically. The other one is in the Middle East. It's a very important time to talk about lasting peace,"" Patalano said.""This is the first forum in person taking place since COVID-19. So it's very important to be here to start redeveloping and reestablishing personal links with colleagues, scholars and officials in China. So one can set a higher expectation in years to come as to how to produce a better collective thinking in light of this personal contact and interaction is being backed, and therefore being able to move directly and openly,"" said Patalano, noting that China has the international capacity to have a voice in how global security is shaped, and the forum can become an important point to get a sense of how China intellectual elites and officials are thinking about this.Senior Colonel Zhao Xiaozhuo, deputy director of the Beijing Xiangshan Forum Secretariat, told the Global Times on Sunday that the forum provides opportunities for countries and regions engaged in conflicts to communicate.The forum has arranged sessions focused on EU and Middle Eastern regional security, as security issues like the Russia-Ukraine conflict and Israel-Palestine conflict are obviously very important to security in EU and the Middle East and would inevitably be touched upon during these sessions, Zhao said.""We have representatives from both engaged sides to attend the sessions. The forum would try best to keep discuss on these topics on a rational path,"" Zhao said.Beijing Xiangshan Forum has been a platform for developing countries to have their voices heard, as the forum encourages them, particularly small- and medium-sized countries, to join the dialogues. Not many international forums offer opportunities for developing countries to make an influence, Zhao said, noting that China is the largest developing country and always stands with the Global South and speaks for developing countries.Joseph Kahama, Secretary General of the Tanzania-China Friendship Promotion Association, told the Global Times at the forum on Sunday that China has always believed in bringing people together, having dialogues and respecting everyone.China's traditional role in not interfering with others and in wanting to dialogue, rather than go to war, is proving to be the only way for world peace right now, Kahama said.The bipolar world where interests of a few ran the world governance is on its way out and the multipolar world where people from different civilizations are sitting down and discussing and respecting each other, and talking about alternative ways to begin peace is working, Kahama said.

441,Why should US fear the Israel-Palestine conflict more than China?,Global Times,2023-10-29,"Why should US fear the Israel-Palestine conflict more than China? The answer: ""hatred."" The Israel-Palestine conflict began because of hatred, which will further escalate and make it increasingly challenging to resolve for future generations. The 9/11 terrorist attacks were fueled by hatred, and US ask: Why do they hate America? There was even an international bestseller to explain it - WHY DO PEOPLE HATE AMERICA? (By Ziauddin Sardar and Merryl Wyn Davies.) You can create enemies to motivate yourself, but this will inevitably undermine mutual trust and provoke antagonism, which has the potential to trigger confrontational strategic escalation until both sides see each other as enemies. But, antagonism does not necessarily trigger hatred immediately unless the antagonism triggers war. Hatred is brewed by war and death. In the abyss of hatred, peace becomes an elusive dream. Bruce Riedel, a scholar at the Brookings Foundation in the US, wrote this in an article on July 27, 2020, entitled ""30 years after our 'endless wars' in the Middle East began, still no end in sight.""After World War II, the US waged 13 wars of varying sizes around the globe, seven of which were related to the Middle East. In 2001, the US launched the war in Afghanistan, a war that lasted until August 2021. In March 2003, the US fabricated and spread the lie that Saddam Hussein was concealing weapons of mass destruction (WMDs), justifying the launch of a full-fledged war in Iraq. Since 2014, the US has been embroiled in a series of wars against Yemen, Iraq, Libya and Syria in military interventions. The Middle East region is already plagued by hostility and hatred, deeply entrenched in the historical conflict between West and Islamic civilizations. With the war in Gaza raging, the Middle East has been filled once again with anger. This anger is not only directed against Israel, but also against Israel's staunchest supporter, the US. Those US warships and bases deployed in the Middle East could become embroiled in the conflict at any time and become hate-mongers. Washington couldn't make a balanced choice between supporting Israel's ""revenge"" and alleviating the humanitarian catastrophe inflicted on the Gaza. US politicians did not even dare to mention the word ""ceasefire."" Washington demands that other countries ""act by international rules,"" but in the case of the Palestine issue, Israel has not complied with UN resolutions.The US is still the most powerful country in the world, but if it can't create more peace, the erosion of its leadership is inevitable. The threat to the US is thus much more than the perceived challenge posed by the rise of China. The illusion that China possesses a comprehensive strategy to supplant or surpass the US and assume the helm of the global order has been hyped up as a matter of life and death for the US by those strategists in Washington who don't even understand China. They forget the actual detriment to US leadership lies in the hate it incessantly cultivates.The US has mainly relied on its powerful military to maintain order. However, its dedication to inclusive development is insufficient. Even when there is commitment, it often comes with solid ideological standards, leading to the ongoing marginalization of specific nations and populations. Consequently, this contributes to the re-emergence of conflicts in the Middle East.After realizing the so-called competition from China's BRI, the US introduced its own ""New Silk Road."" But Washington's planning of this strategy is still focused on safeguarding its leadership and counterbalancing the rivals, and not focused on providing a common and inclusive development.",OPINION,OBSERVER,Photo: AFP,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'US': ('LOC', 10), 'Israel': ('LOC', 5), 'Palestine': ('LOC', 2), 'China': ('LOC', 1), 'America': ('LOC', 1), 'Middle East': ('LOC', 5), 'Afghanistan': ('LOC', 1), 'Iraq': ('LOC', 2), 'Yemen': ('LOC', 1), 'Libya': ('LOC', 1), 'Syria': ('LOC', 1), 'West': ('LOC', 1), 'Gaza': ('LOC', 2), 'Washington': ('LOC', 1), '9 / 11': ('MISC', 1), 'World War II': ('MISC', 1), 'Islamic': ('MISC', 1), 'POPLE': ('ORG', 1), 'AMERICA': ('ORG', 1), 'Brookings Foundation': ('ORG', 1), 'Ziauddin Sardar': ('PER', 1), 'Merryl Wyn Davies': ('PER', 1), 'Bruce Riedel': ('PER', 1), 'Saddam Hussein': ('PER', 1)}"
442,"Path to San Francisco won’t be an easy one, no self-driving to it: FM Wang",Zhao Yusha,2023-10-29,"When noting that China and the US agreed to work together for the meeting between the two heads of state in San Francisco, China foreign minister Wang Yi said on Saturday that ""the path to San Francisco"" will not be an easy one, and there is ""no self-driving to it."" Therefore, both sides need to earnestly ""return to Bali [consensus],"" truly implement the common understanding reached by the two leaders, remove disruption, overcome obstacles, build consensus, and accumulate outcomes, Wang said.China analysts believe this signals Beijing's discontent with Washington's lack of sincerity and efforts in stabilizing China-US ties. The US recent moves of reaching out to China mainly serve for convening a grand APEC meeting, yet falls short of responding to China's core concerns, warned China observers. They said Wang's comment that there is ""no self-driving"" to San Francisco is a reminder to the US to rein in its toxic domestic politics that are highly antagonistic of China; and that high-level communication between China and the US won't come ""automatically"" unless the US makes more efforts.      Despite the various differences and contradictions between the two countries, and there are still many issues that need to be resolved, both sides believe that maintaining dialogue between the two major countries is beneficial and necessary. They both hope that bilateral relations can stabilize and strive for improvement as soon as possible, Wang, also member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, said in a discussion with members of the US strategic community in Washington on Saturday.

Wang Yi speaks with members of the US strategic community in Washington on October 28, 2023. Photo: Website of Foreign Ministry Wang also held talks with representatives from US business circles in Washington on Saturday. Wang stated that the driving force for cooperation between China and the US remains strong, the foundation remains solid, and the space for cooperation remains vast. He expressed the hope that everyone will seize the new opportunities offered by China's high-quality development and high-level opening-up, play a role as a ballast stone in economic and trade cooperation, cultivate friendly public opinion and social foundation between the two countries.Wang held two rounds of talks with Blinken on Thursday and Friday, during which the two sides agreed to work together toward a meeting between the two heads of state in San Francisco.When he met with the US President Joe Biden on Friday, Wang said that his visit is aimed at communicating with the US side to follow through on the important common understandings reached by the two heads of state, and proceed from the Bali summit towards a San Francisco summit, so as to prevent bilateral ties from further deteriorating and bring the China-US relationship back on the track of healthy and steady development at an early date.Not enoughFrom Wang's remarks and recent news reports, it is clear that China is not satisfied with US' sincerity and efforts in improving the bilateral ties, Wu Xinbo, director of the Center for US Studies at Fudan University, told the Global Times. Wu pointed out that the recent eagerness from the US to reach out to China is partly due to Joe Biden's hope of hosting a grand APEC leaders' meeting; but the US failed to address issues concerning China's core interests. Via a grand meeting, Joe Biden tries to send a signal to US' domestic audience that Joe Biden is capable of stabilizing China-US relations while engaging in intense competition with Beijing, said Wu. Washington did not cease its crackdown on China's tech industry. The Joe Biden administration is reducing the types of semiconductors that US companies can sell to China, citing the desire to close loopholes in existing regulations announced last year.Earlier this month, US media NBC reported that officials in Joe Biden's administration have privately told lawmakers that the White House is preparing a supplemental funding request to submit to Congress that includes money for Israel, Ukraine, Taiwan and US border security. During his US visit, Wang told US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan that ""Taiwan independence"" is the biggest threat to peace and stability across the Taiwan Straits and the biggest challenge facing China-US relations. It must be firmly opposed with concrete policies and actions. Li Haidong, a professor at the China Foreign Affairs University, told the Global Times that the US should also rein in its toxic domestic politics that is highly confrontational against China. ""The US domestic politics itself is highly confrontational, and they need to resolve internal conflicts by creating external enemies. This trend means that there will always be confrontation in US-China relations.""The US side needs to make sure that anti-China hawks won't thwart the efforts of pushing for a meeting between the two heads of state in San Francisco, Li said. US Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell recently referred to China, Russia and Iran as the new ""axis of evil"" that the US must confront in an interview with the US media on October 22.The US cannot count on setting up a time and place and hope high-level meetings between the two countries to occur ""automatically,"" more needs to be done by the US to stabilize bilateral relations, said Wu. Window of opportunityThe majority of people in both China and the US have rationally realized that if conflict and confrontation occur between China and the US, the world would undoubtedly face catastrophe. However, this does not mean that we can automatically avoid this worst-case scenario by adopting a ""lying-flat"" attitude, China former ambassador to the US Cui Tiankai said at a high-level dialogue at the 10th Beijing Xiangshan Forum on Sunday. Since June this year, the two countries have embraced more frequent high-level exchanges, with Blinken, US Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo, US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and US Special Envoy on Climate Change John Kerry visiting China respectively. The most recent one is California governor Gavin Newsom, who has received a warm welcome in China as his open-mindedness on cooperation has been highly praised by the China public. China-US economic working group held its first meeting via video link last week. The US also sent participants to the 10th Beijing Xiangshan Forum scheduled from Sunday to Tuesday. In the upcoming winter-spring flight season, the number of China-US direct regular passenger flights is expected to increase from the current 48 (24 round trips) per week to 70 per week, CAAC News reported on Saturday citing the Civil Aviation Administration of China. Overall, negativity still prevails positivity in terms of China-US relation since the ""balloon incident"" when bilateral ties froze, Da Wei, director of Center for International Security and Strategy at Tsinghua University, told the Global Times, noting that now is the window of opportunity for the two to stabilize ties and prevent the relations from reaching another nadir. Wu said that the window of opportunity for the two countries to stabilize ties is rather short, as China will closely watch if the US will return to its reckless crackdown on China after the possible higher-level meeting. He also noted that the bilateral relations also face ordeals from the 2024 elections for Taiwan's regional leader; and next year's US election also poses a challenge as playing the ""China card"" is a usual tactic by presidential candidates.",CHINA,DIPLOMACY,File photo: China US,"Reporter, Beijing","Global Times reporter covering international affairs, politics and society.","{'China': ('LOC', 11), 'US': ('LOC', 11), 'San Francisco': ('LOC', 4), 'Bali': ('LOC', 1), 'Beijing': ('LOC', 1), 'Washington': ('LOC', 4), 'Wang Yi': ('PER', 9), 'Joe': ('PER', 1), 'APEC': ('ORG', 1), 'Political Bureau': ('ORG', 1), 'CPC Central Committee': ('ORG', 1), 'Foreign Ministry': ('ORG', 1)}"
443,Israel starts 2nd phase of war as UNGA resolution calls for truce,Yang Sheng,2023-10-29,"Although the UN adopted a resolution on Friday on Gaza which calls for an immediate and sustained humanitarian truce leading to a cessation of hostilities, Israel still launched the second phase of its war against the Gaza, bringing death toll on Palestine side since the war to nearly 8,000, mostly civilians including women and children.China analysts said that despite mounting pressure from the vast majority of the international community to stop the bloodshed, the international community is failing in its efforts because the US, a permanent member of UN with veto power and the protector of Israel in this region, has gone to great lengths to pave the way for a ground attack in the name of ""counterterrorism"" and ""self-defense"" of Israel and with the fast rising death toll, the conflict is likely to spill over to the whole Middle East.On Friday, by a recorded vote of 121 in favor to 14 against, with 44 abstentions, the UN adopted a resolution titled ""Protection of civilians and upholding legal and humanitarian obligations,"" with countries including China, Russia, France, as well as Saudi Arabia and Muslim countries, voting in favor, and even close US allies like the UK and Japan abstaining, while the US, Israel and a few other countries voted against.The US has asked for China's help to prevent escalation of the crisis during US Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer's trip to China earlier this month, and during the latest meeting with China Foreign Minister Wang Yi in the US, Secretary of State Antony Blinken expressed the view that there is a need to return to and implement the two-state solution, which is in line with China's stance about political solution of the Palestine-Israel issue.However, according to the votes in the UN and the UN, it shows that Washington holds a very different position compared not only to China but also to the vast majority of the international community in terms of a humanitarian truce, so to what extent China and the US can work together in stopping the crisis is still in question, as experts said this can happen only when Washington realizes that it should not stand on the wrong side of the history.  Long and difficult warIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told the nation on Saturday night that the military has opened a ""second stage"" in the ""war against Hamas"" by sending ground forces into Gaza and expanding attacks from the ground, air and sea, and he warned that the war will be ""long and difficult,"" per Associated Press report.  The AP reported on Sunday that Gaza residents described the massive bombardment from the land, air and sea as ""the most intense"" of the three-week Israel-Hamas war. It knocked out most communications in the territory late on Friday and largely cut off the besieged enclave's 2.3 million people from the world.  According to Palestine's state TV on Sunday, the death toll from the relentless Israel bombing of Gaza and clashes in the West Bank since October 7 has risen to 7,814, the Anadolu Agency reported. It said in a statement that 21,693 others were wounded as a result of Israel's actions ""against our people.""  Liu Zhongmin, a professor at the Middle East Studies Institute of Shanghai International Studies University, told the Global Times on Sunday that once Israel forces launch a ground attack that aims at a long-term occupation of some areas of Gaza and seeking the complete elimination of Hamas, ""the death toll will rise much more sharply than at present.""Street combat will be extremely brutal, the bombardments will be more intense, and due to the blockade, more civilians and the wounded will die because of the shortage of medicines, food and water. Israel forces will also sustain heavy casualties because by using their network of tunnels, Hamas is capable of inflicting significant casualties on Israel forces, Liu said.With the rising death toll, the pressure on Israel and the US will rise as well, and if Israel's military offensive results in more casualties of Palestine civilians, regional major powers like Iran and Saudi Arabia, as well as those who have already established diplomatic ties with Israel like Turkey and Egypt, will take further actions, said Wang Jin, an associate professor at the Institute of Middle Eastern Studies of Northwest University. ""Even though some of them might be reluctant to get involved, the fury among their nationals will force them to take actions, as helping Palestine resist Israel is the shared and top political correctness among the Muslim world,"" Wang Jin noted. Furies from Muslim worldIranian President Ebrahim Raisi said in a statement on X (formerly known as Twitter) on Sunday that the ""Zionist regime's crimes have crossed the red lines, which may force everyone to take action. Washington asks us to not do anything, but they keep giving widespread support to Israel. The US sent messages to the Axis of Resistance but received a clear response on the battlefield."" Turkey President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said at a huge rally in Istanbul on Saturday that ""Israel, you are an occupier"" and he accused the Israel government of behaving like a ""war criminal"" and trying to ""eradicate"" Palestine, according to media reports. ""Of course, every country has the right to defend itself. But where is the justice in this case? There is no justice - just a vicious massacre happening in Gaza."" After this, Israel said Saturday it was recalling its diplomatic staff from Turkey, media reported. Saudi Arabia's foreign ministry denounced Israel ground operations in Gaza in a statement released on Sunday on X, which it said would threaten the lives of Palestine civilians and result in inhumane dangers.The kingdom, which was heading toward normalizing relations with Israel before this round of conflict, warns of the danger of continuing to carry out these flagrant and unjustified violations that are contrary to international law.""  On Thursday, the United Saudi Arabia Emirates, Jordan, Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, Oman, Qatar, Kuwait, Egypt and Morocco, in a joint statement, condemned the targeting of civilians and the ""flagrant violations of international law"" in Gaza. Iran, which considers Israel as an enemy, is likely to take more direct action to support forces like Hezbollah in Lebanon and the Houthi movement in Yemen, and Saudi Arabia, Turkey and Egypt are likely to allow and encourage NGOs and other groups to break through the Israel's blockade of Gaza to provide humanitarian supplies to the Palestine in the region, experts said. Israel is facing a tough situation, as the war will not end in the short term as long as it insists on eliminating Hamas, and the casualties will increase terribly on both sides. However, if it stops the operation and accepts a truce, it will face huge pressures domestically, and the US will also share these problems, pressures and embarrassments with Israel before the end of the bloodshed, China analysts noted.",CHINA,DIPLOMACY,A ruthless stand.

444,UN General Assembly resolution reflects strong call for Gaza ceasefire: Chinese ambassador to UN,Global Times,2023-10-28,"The UN on Friday passed a non-binding resolution for humanitarian truce in Gaza by a vote of 120-14, and China Ambassador Zhang Jun, Permanent Representative of China to the UN, said China welcomes the resolution and that its overwhelming vote in UN reflects the strong call from the majority of member states for a ceasefire and an end to the conflict in the region.The resolution was proposed by Jordan in the name of 22 Saudi Arabia countries, which called for ""an immediate, durable and sustained humanitarian truce leading to a cessation of hostilities.""The resolution demands that all parties comply with international law and protect civilians, calls on Israel to revoke the emergency evacuation order in the northern Gaza, and opposes the forced displacement of Palestine civilians. The resolution reaffirms the need for a just and lasting solution to the Palestinian-Israeli Conflict conflict based on the ""two-state solution."" It received 120 votes in favor among the 193-member UN, and 14 against and 45 abstentions. Israel and the US voted against the resolution for ""failing"" to mention Hamas. France voted for the truce, while Germany, Italy and Britain abstained, according to media reports.China is a co-sponsor of this resolution and voted in favor. China Ambassador Zhang said that China hopes this resolution will be fully implemented and China highly appreciates and will continue to firmly support Saudi Arabia and Islamic countries in playing a leading role in the Palestine issue.Zhang said that since the outbreak of the new round of conflict between Palestine and Israel, China has been firmly opposed to and condemned all violence and attacks against civilians from the very beginning. China strongly calls for the de-escalation of tensions and the immediate cessation of hostilities, and urges all diplomatic efforts of the international community to converge on this goal. China is closely monitoring the humanitarian situation in the Gaza, supports the opening of humanitarian corridors, and has provided emergency humanitarian assistance to the Gaza,  Zhang said.The fundamental solution to the Palestine issue lies in the establishment of an independent Palestine state with full sovereignty on the basis of the 1967 borders and with Jerusalem as its capital. While the international community is engaged in crisis management in the new round, it must adhere to the fundamental direction of the ""two-state solution,"" promote broader consensus, and develop a timetable and roadmap for this purpose.Zhang said that China will continue to stand on the side of peace, justice, and international law, and work tirelessly with all parties in the international community to achieve an early end to the Gaza conflict, achieve peaceful coexistence between Palestine and Israel, and achieve long-term stability in the Middle East.Global Times",CHINA,DIPLOMACY,Photo: CFP,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'UN': ('ORG', 4), 'Hamas': ('ORG', 1), 'Gaza': ('LOC', 4), 'China': ('LOC', 11), 'Jordan': ('LOC', 1), 'Saudi Arabia': ('LOC', 2), 'Israel': ('LOC', 3), 'Palestine': ('LOC', 5), 'US': ('LOC', 1), 'France': ('LOC', 1), 'Germany': ('LOC', 1), 'Italy': ('LOC', 1), 'Britain': ('LOC', 1), 'Jerusalem': ('LOC', 1), 'Zhang Jun': ('PER', 5), 'Palestinian - Israeli Conflict': ('MISC', 1), 'Islamic': ('MISC', 1)}"
445,"Wang Yi meets Joe Biden, calls for joint effort for potential meeting of heads of state in San Francisco",GT staff reporters,2023-10-28,"China's top diplomat and Foreign Minister Wang Yi met with US President Joe Biden in the White House on Friday local time. The purpose of this visit was to communicate with the US and effectively implement the important consensus reached at the meeting between the two heads of state in Bali last year, and look forward to San Francisco, in order to promote the stabilization and recovery of China-US relations for it to quickly return to a healthy and stable development track, Wang told Joe Biden.Analysts said Wang's visit marks an extension of the warming atmosphere in China-US high-level interactions since May this year and was set to create the necessary conditions and pave way for higher level exchanges between the two countries. The onus of putting bilateral relations on track lies entirely on the US, as the US is urged to abandon its selfish and condescending gestures in ties with China like cracking down on China in some areas to maintain the US' hegemony. During his meeting with Joe Biden, Wang, also director of the Office of the Foreign Affairs Commission of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee, stated that the one-China principle and the three joint communiqués between China and the US are the most important political foundation for bilateral relations, and must be upheld without interference.China attaches importance to the US desire for stabilizing and improving bilateral relations, Wang said, noting that all parties should act responsibly toward the world, history, and people, and promote the stable and positive development of China-US relations based on the three principles of mutual respect, peaceful coexistence and win-win cooperation proposed by President Xi Jinping. This not only serves the fundamental interests of both countries and their peoples but also meets the common expectations of the international community.Joe Biden expressed that the US side is willing to maintain communication with China and work together to address global challenges.During his US visit, Wang also held talks with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and with US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan.""Taiwan secessionism"" is the greatest threat to peace and stability in the Taiwan Straits and the biggest challenge to China-US relations, and must be firmly opposed in specific policies and action, Wang told Sullivan. The two agreed to a joint effort for a potential meeting between the two heads of state in San Francisco.Wang and Sullivan engaged in communication on issues of mutual concern, including China-US relations, high-level exchanges between the two countries, and the Palestine-Israel conflict.China experts said that Wang's visit took place at the invitation of Blinken, and the series of talks he had with US high-level officials demonstrated the US' strong desire to both stabilize and enhance wide-ranging communication with China.Wu Xinbo, director of the Center for US Studies at Fudan University, said that the Joe Biden administration's eagerness in reaching out to China was partly out of hope for a successful and productive hosting of APEC, as it tries to send a signal to a domestic audience that Joe Biden is capable of stabilizing China-US relations while engaging in intense competition with Beijing. The US is set to host APEC in 2023 under the theme of ""Creating a Resilient and Sustainable Future for All"" in San Francisco.Diao Daming, an associate professor at Renmin University of China in Beijing, told the Global Times on Saturday that ""the accelerated interaction between China and the US has led to a more stable atmosphere between the two countries. Only if a similar tone is maintained will more higher-level exchanges have meaning."" Diao pointed out that Wang's reference to ""looking forward to San Francisco"" means the two countries are making an effort to create a more favorable atmosphere for potential higher level meetings.Ball on US courtWhen meeting with Blinken on Thursday, Wang said that jarring voices are often heard on China-US relations, but China is calm about them because China believes the criterion for right and wrong is not determined by who has more bravado or a louder voice, but by whether one behaves in line with the provisions of the three China-US joint communiques, with the international law and the basic norms of international relations, and with the trend of the times.Diao pointed out that the US is now exercising a ""à la carte"" manner of cooperating with China, which means the US points out areas it is willing to cooperate while still cracking down on China in other areas to maintain its hegemony.For example, on Thursday, the US Indo-Pacific Command claimed that a China fighter jet executed an ""unsafe intercept"" of a US Air Force B-52 aircraft over the South China Sea this week, according to US media.To show the truth of the US' close-in reconnaissance on China's doorstep, the China Ministry of National Defense published video footage to show that the US is the provoker and trouble maker.China experts said if the US is sincere in pushing for a meeting between the two heads of state, it should abandon its double-faced and condescending behavior, commit in actions to create benign atmosphere between the two countries.Diao noted that if the meeting between the heads of state is realized, it will not only inject crucial vitality to bilateral relations, but also help create global stability for a world in turmoil.Wu said that the window opportunity for the two countries to stabilize ties is rather short, as China will closely watch if the US will return to its reckless crackdown on China after the possible higher-level meeting.Moreover, bilateral relations also face pressure from 2024 elections for Taiwan's regional leader. If Taiwan's Democratic Progressive Party continues to govern, the cross-Straits relations will further strain. The tension may also spill over into the China-US relations, potentially bringing an end to the recent period of easing tensions, said Wu.The next year's US election also poses a challenge as playing ""China card"" is a usual tactic by presidential candidates, Wu noted, saying that so far, the China-US relation is easing rather than improving; whether the goal of improvement can be achieved through higher-level meetings is yet to be seen.",CHINA,DIPLOMACY,Photo: fmprc.gov.cn,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'China': ('LOC', 12), 'US': ('LOC', 16), 'White House': ('LOC', 1), 'Bali': ('LOC', 1), 'San Francisco': ('LOC', 2), 'Taiwan': ('LOC', 1), 'Taiwan Straits': ('LOC', 2), 'Wang Yi': ('PER', 8), 'Joe Biden': ('PER', 4), 'Xi Jinping': ('PER', 1), 'Antony': ('PER', 1), 'Jake Sullivan': ('PER', 3), 'Office of the Foreign Affairs Commission': ('ORG', 1), 'Communist Party of China': ('ORG', 1), 'CPC': ('ORG', 1), 'Central Committee': ('ORG', 1), 'Francisco': ('ORG', 1)}"
446,"US House elects new speaker amid divided, polarized domestic political situation",Yang Sheng,2023-10-27,"After three weeks without a speaker in the House following the ousting of Kevin McCarthy, Republican House Representative Mike Johnson of Louisiana was elected as the new speaker on Wednesday local time. On the same day, a mass shooting occurred in Lewiston, Maine, which killed at least 18 people. The massacre is one of the deadliest in the US in recent years. China analysts said on Thursday that the US domestic political and security situation is still worrisome and the power struggle between Democrats and Republican will add uncertainties to US internal and external policies.China experts on US studies said Johnson's election will expand fiscal conservatism in the House, making it more difficult for President Joe Biden and his administration to reach agreement with the Republican on issues such as supporting Ukraine and avoiding another shutdown, while the House will be more assertive in helping Donald Trump in the 2024 presidential election and prevent him from being harmed by legal investigations launched by Democrats. As someone with a hardline stance against China and a member of the ""Congressional Taiwan Caucus"" that supports ""Taiwan secessionism,"" Johnson could be more aggressive than his predecessors in adding challenges to China-US relations, said analysts. Some observers also raised concerns that the US House speaker's attitude toward China became worse from Nancy Pelosi and Kevin McCarthy and will continue to do so with Mike Johnson, reflecting a poisoned political atmosphere in the US, which is a problem that the US side should overcome if it wants to better manage US-China relations and ease bilateral tensions.  Johnson secured the gavel without losing any GOP votes. The final tally was 220 votes for Johnson and 209 for House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, US media reported. According to CNN, ""Johnson is a Donald Trump ally."" The speaker was a key congressional figure in the failed efforts to overturn the 2020 election for former President Donald Trump. He sent an email from a personal account in 2020 to every House Republican soliciting signatures for an amicus brief in the long-shot Texas lawsuit seeking to invalidate electoral college votes from multiple states.Lü Xiang, an expert on US studies and research fellow at the China Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times on Thursday that it is certain Republican in the House will be more united and make more efforts to guard Donald Trump's campaign and help the former president overcome the challenges of legal investigations launched by Democrats. ""This means the struggle between the two parties won't be eased, but will get more intense.""Johnson now faces pressing issues, CNN's report said, including a potential shutdown. Government funding is set to expire on November 17, and the GOP-controlled House will need to work with the Democratic-led Senate to avert it, while lawmakers must also consider aid to Ukraine and Israel.The crisis of a government shutdown still exists, and with the latest deadly shooting in Maine, the struggle between the two parties on long-standing issues such as gun control are likely to further tear US society apart, experts said.""Johnson and Republican in the House will keep pressuring the Joe Biden administration to reduce support for Ukraine, especially with the situation in Gaza and the need from Israel for military and economic support. Johnson will pressure Joe Biden to be more assertive in defending Israel's war against Gaza,"" Lü noted.According to the VOA, Johnson is an obvious ""China hawk"" in the House, as he holds a hostile stance on China in the fields of the Taiwan Straits, COVID-19 and sanctions against China officials.However, China-US relations might see some major new changes in the coming weeks, as the APEC meeting will be held in San Francisco next month, so to what extent the Republican and the newly elected speaker will impact the US' policy toward China remains in question, Li Haidong, a professor at the China Foreign Affairs University, told the Global Times on Thursday.",CHINA,POLITICS,"US House Speaker Mike Johnson is congratulated by House Majority Leader Steve Scalise after being elected on the House floor at the US Capitol October 25, 2023.

447,"Albanese’s US visit ‘awkward, disappointing’; Washington finding it 'hard to collude'",Xu Keyue,2023-10-27," ""It's a state visit of awkwardness and disappointment,"" a China analyst said of Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese's US visit from Monday to Thursday, pointing out that the two allies apparently found it hard to yield substantial results during the trip, although the Joe Biden administration is wooing Canberra to closely follow its strategy to suppress Beijing.US President Joe Biden sought to prove he can keep the longer-term goal of countering China in his sights as the Israel-Palestine conflict grinds on, hosting the Australian prime minister at the White House for a series of high-level meetings, the Wall Street Journal revealed.The news report by the US media outlet tries to stress that China-related issues are still on the top of the US' agenda, even as the country is consumed by a crisis in the Middle East, and the Joe Biden administration has given priority to relations with Australia, which is viewed as a linchpin in the US effort to counter China.However, there was a different feeling in mainstream Australian media, which expressed anxiety over the ambiguous and mixed reactions from the US during Albanese's visit.Unlike previous boasts of the close alliance between the US and Australia, Australian media outlet ABC News said, ""Albanese is walking a diplomatic tightrope between the US and China.""Chen Hong, director of the Australian Studies Centre of East China Normal University, said that Albanese's US trip is awkward and disappointing.The Australian prime minister was about to deliver a speech in the US Congress, but his visit came just as the House was emerging from its weeks-long internal stalemate. On Thursday morning, a new speaker of the House was finally elected.ABC News reported that ""the US Congress was doing little this week to show its priorities laid with the Indo-Pacific, AUKUS, the Australian prime minister, or anything other than its own infighting.""The absence of a House speaker until Thursday meant an invitation couldn't be issued in time for Albanese to deliver an address to a joint sitting of congress.AUKUS is the major topic for Albanese during the US trip as the deal has failed to deliver almost anything since its announcement in 2021, making it continue to be an ""empty promise,"" Chen said.Albanese hopes to crystallize AUKUS and turn it into something substantial, he continued.However, the deal has long faced resistance within the US Congress as some members argued that the US' military production capacity has reached its limit considering the significant amount of effort, especially on military and defense, the country has put into the Ukraine crisis and the Palestine-Israel conflict. So despite Joe Biden's continuous efforts to promote progress on AUKUS, it raises doubts about whether Australia's needs can still be taken into account in time, according to analysts.Separately, according to US media, the two leaders made announcements that included an agreement to allow US companies to launch into space from Australia, cooperation on critical minerals and artificial intelligence.""Critical minerals"" is another focus of Albanese's US visit, analysts said. The concept of critical minerals is a recent development by the US, Chen revealed. He noted that any minerals that contribute to China's economic development and technological progress are considered critical minerals by the US, as it wants to hinder China's peaceful development. The US hopes to woo and pressure its allies and partners together to restrict China's access to such minerals, Chen said.Australia, on the other hand, has the largest known reserves and production of lithium in the world, most of which is exported to China. Due to economic interests, Australia doesn't really want to fully listen to the US regarding the mineral issue, analysts said.Given the different calculations and interests between the two allies, it is unlikely the Australian head's US trip will yield substantial results, several analysts believe, who also cited Albanese's upcoming visit to China as another factor.According to the website of the Prime Minister of Australia, Albanese will become the first Australian prime minister to visit China in seven years when he travels to Beijing and Shanghai on November 4-7.China welcomes Albanese to visit the country and attend the 6th China International Import Expo (CIIE), Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said on Monday.Chen remarked that Australia has always lacked an independent foreign policy, and the US-Australia alliance is undoubtedly its cornerstone. However, Albanese is seeking to carve out a more independent space for Australia.",CHINA,POLITICS,"US President Joe Biden meets Australia's Prime Minister Anthony Albanese in the Oval Office of the White House, October 25, 2023, in Washington.

448,Israel risks losing world's sympathy amid brutal retaliation in Gaza,Hu Xijin,2023-10-27,"As civilian lives were being lost every day on the battlefield in Gaza, the UN staged a fierce ""second battlefield."" Draft resolutions proposed by the US and Russia regarding the situation in Gaza were successively vetoed during the UN meeting held on Wednesday. On the surface, the US draft resolution received support from 10 votes, more than the four votes received by the Russia draft resolution, seemingly gaining the upper hand.However, the only Saudi Arabia country among the 15 countries, the United Saudi Arabia Emirates (UAE), voted in favor of the Russia draft resolution and opposed the US draft resolution.China's vote was consistent with the UAE's. In addition, in a draft resolution vote proposed by Brazil a week ago, 12 votes, including China, supported it, with the US being the only opposing vote.In this round of opposing votes, the US draft resolution was opposed by Russia, China, and the UAE, while the Russia draft resolution was opposed by the US and the UK. In terms of abstentions, the US draft resolution received two, while the Russia draft resolution received nine.In fact, the US draft resolution is paving the way for Israel to carry out a brutal ground offensive. The draft resolution unilaterally condemns Hamas without explicitly criticizing Israel. Although it also expresses humanitarian concerns and advocates for a ""humanitarian pause,"" the draft resolution also ""reaffirms the inherent right of all States to individual and collective self-defense."" In the current reality, this is almost certain to be interpreted by Israel as a justification for its indiscriminate attacks on both armed personnel and civilians in Gaza, providing it with a self-defense argument. With this provision, Israel can label any of its actions in Gaza as ""self-defense"" supported by the UN.When vetoing the US draft resolution, the Russia representative specifically pointed out that the International Court of Justice clearly stated in an advisory opinion in 2004 that the right to self-defense does not apply to occupying powers, and Israel still occupies Palestine territories.The US unilaterally demanded that all countries ""prevent the export of arms and materiel to armed militias and terrorist groups operating in Gaza, including Hamas."" However, there is no call to cease providing weapons to the Israel side, which clearly represents an imbalance. The US itself openly provides emergency military assistance to Israel, always framing its military aid to one side as just, while exerting pressure and prohibiting aid to the other side of the conflict. This pattern was evident in Ukraine, and now it is repeating in the Middle East.After the UN vote reached an impasse, a resolution drafted by Jordan on behalf of Saudi Arabia nations is scheduled for voting at the Emergency Special Session of UN on Thursday. Many observers believe that this resolution will pass in a vote involving all 193 member states of the UN, without any country possessing a veto. Although the resolution would not be binding like that of the UN, it will reflect the will of the majority of the international community and have political and public opinion consequences.In the past couple of days, several videos from UN sessions have circulated on the China internet, in which the Israel representative displayed an arrogant attitude. Israel seems to have been spoiled by several major West powers, including the US. At times, Israel demands the immediate resignation of the UN Secretary-General, or threatens to ""wipe off"" Iran from the face of the earth. The world sympathizes with the hardships that the Jewish people endured during World War II and with the Israel civilians who have come under attack in the current conflict. However, none of this grants Israel the authority to retaliate without restraint, causing the deaths of women and children. The fact is, the brutal retaliatory actions of the IDF are generating increasing global antipathy. Israel is depleting the world's sympathy for it, and morally, it is transforming itself from a victim into one of the world's most brutal inflicters.The author is a China media professional. opinion@globaltimes.com.cn",OPINION,VIEWPOINT,"Displaced Palestinian children are seen in a temporary shelter in the southern Gaza Strip, October 25, 2023.

452,"Chinese envoy visits Saudi Arabia, calling for efforts for fair settlement of Palestinian issue",Global Times,2023-10-27,"Amid a mounting death toll and expanding humanitarian crisis in the Israel-Palestine conflict, Zhai Jun, special envoy of the China government on Middle East issues, visited Saudi Arabia to advance China's efforts to cool down the situation. Zhai told Saudi Arabia Deputy Foreign Minister Waleed Al-Khuraiji during his visit to the country on Thursday that the current situation between Palestine and Israel is grim. China is saddened by the large number of civilian casualties caused by the conflict and the deterioration of the humanitarian situation. China is willing to maintain communication and coordination with Saudi Arabia, pool efforts to promote peace, and promote a comprehensive and fair settlement of the Palestine issue at an early date. Zhai said China believes that only by ceasefire and cessation and promoting the cooling of the situation can there be necessary conditions for a political settlement.Restarting Palestinian-Israeli Conflict peace talks on the basis of the ""two-state solution"" is the only realistic way to break the vicious cycle of the Palestinian-Israeli Conflict, Zhai emphasized. Saudi Arabia is an important country in the Middle East, and China has always placed Saudi Arabia at the forefront of China's Middle East diplomacy. China is willing to work with Saudi Arabia to implement the important consensus reached by the leaders of the two countries and continuously enhance China-Saudi Arabia comprehensive strategic partnership, Zhai told Al-Khuraiji. Zhai started his trip to the Middle East by visiting Qatar on October 19 where he met with his Russia and Qatari counterparts. Later on, Zhai attended a peace summit in Cairo, Egypt before visiting the UAE.Zhai had said in the meeting with Mikhail Bogdanov, Russia's Deputy FM and Special Presidential Representative for the Middle East and Africa, that China and Russia share the same position on the Palestine issue. ""China is ready to maintain communication and coordination with Russia to cool down the Palestinian-Israeli Conflict conflict and play a positive role in promoting a comprehensive, just, and lasting resolution to the Palestine issue."" Global Times",CHINA,DIPLOMACY,"Zhai Jun, special envoy of the Chinese government on Middle East issues, talks with Saudi Deputy Foreign Minister Waleed Al-Khuraiji during his visit to the country on October 26.

454,Supporting UN in playing a greater role in Israeli-Palestinian issue is crucial: Global Times editorial,Global Times,2023-10-26,"The humanitarian crisis in the Gaza is still worsening. The latest diplomatic dispute between Israel and the UN (UN) over the statement made by Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has further complicated international efforts to address the urgent humanitarian crisis in Gaza. During the public debate on the Palestinian-Israeli Conflict issue held by the UN (UN) on October 24, Israel not only demanded that Guterres should resign ""unless he apologizes immediately"" due to dissatisfaction with his speech, but also stated that they would refuse to issue visas to UN representatives, claiming ""the time has come to teach them a lesson."" The latest reports indicate that Israel has already rejected the visa application of Martin Griffiths, Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs.What has angered Israel is the remarks made by Guterres, saying ""the attacks by Hamas did not happen in a vacuum … The Palestine people have been subjected to 56 years of suffocating occupation."" Looking at this statement from a neutral standpoint, it's a factual statement, stemming from an understanding of the complex historical context of the Palestinian-Israeli Conflict conflict. People can see that it does not imply support for Hamas' attacks.In fact, Guterres promptly and unequivocally condemned Hamas' attacks. In his remarks on October 24, he mentioned that ""the grievances of the Palestine people cannot justify the appalling attacks by Hamas,"" and also stated that ""those appalling attacks cannot justify the collective punishment of the Palestine people."" Furthermore, Guterres' speech primarily emphasized the paramount principle of protecting civilians, the urgent need for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire, and the fact that the only realistic foundation for peace and stability in the Middle East that the world cannot ignore is the ""two-state solution."" According to a reporter from Al Jazeera who was present, many countries welcomed Guterres' speech and considered it to be ""very balanced.""The Palestinian-Israeli Conflict issue has a complex historical context, and different perspectives often lead to very different conclusions, which is quite normal. Israel, as a party to the conflict, has its own stance and views, and it certainly has the right to express its opinions. However, there are boundaries to such expressions. Respecting and upholding the authority of the UN is one of these boundaries. Especially in the current situation, the Palestinian-Israeli Conflict conflict is causing significant civilian casualties every day, including many women and children. The situation is extremely urgent, and at such a time, it is even more necessary to form a united front at the UN level.Since the conflict began, although the UN has not yet reached a resolution on the Palestinian-Israeli Conflict issue due to repeated oppositions from the US, still in areas such as the delivery of relief supplies through the Rafah border crossing and humanitarian relief efforts in Gaza, UN agencies have played an undeniable role. The UN is set to resume its 10th Emergency Special Session on the situation in Israel and Palestine on October 26, and although negotiations in the UN regarding the Palestinian-Israeli Conflict issue have faced difficulties, they are ongoing. In the current situation, the UN remains the most significant platform to bring together voices of various parties and has the best potential for forming a common international stance and action plan. Many countries, including West allies of the US, acknowledge that a lasting and just solution to the Palestine issue ultimately relies on the ""two-state solution"" based on UN resolutions.Therefore, from any perspective, the authority of the UN must be upheld, and even in the context of the Palestinian-Israeli Conflict issue, UN should be supported to play a greater role. The recent attitudes of Israel toward Guterres, as well as the unilateral actions of the US at the UN and their refusal to support a consensus on a ceasefire, highlight one of the root causes of the prolonged Palestinian-Israeli Conflict conflict: the failure to implement and enforce UN resolutions. From the principle of a permanent two-state solution based on the 1967 borders to the promotion of a peace treaty, the UN has consistently maintained a clear stance and issued explicit resolutions on the Palestinian-Israeli Conflict issue. Unfortunately, these have not received the attention they deserve, and the recent tragedy once again underscores the need for all parties to respect the authority of the UN.In fact, whether for Israel or the US, upholding the authority of the UN and supporting the UN to play a greater role in the Palestinian-Israeli Conflict issue is beneficial and harmless. The US' ""war on terror"" for the past 20 years has demonstrated that collective punishment does not alleviate extremism; it instead perpetuates a cycle of violence. The fact will prove that the proper solution to the Palestinian-Israeli Conflict issue lies in promptly reconvening an international peace conference within the framework of the UN, based on the ""two-state solution,"" in order to break the cycle of violence.",OPINION,EDITORIAL,"Secretary-General Antonio Guterres speaks during the UN Security Council meeting on the situation in the Middle East at UN Headquarters in New York on October 24, 2023.

455,China calls for ceasefire in Israeli-Palestinian conflict and humanitarian assistance to war-torn Gaza,Global Times,2023-10-26,"Zhai Jun, special envoy of the China government on the Middle East issue, exchanged views on China-UAE relations and the current situation in the Palestinian-Israeli Conflict conflict with Ahmed Ali Al Sayegh, Minister of State to the United Saudi Arabia Emirates (UAE), on October 24 during his visit to the UAE, calling for a ceasefire in Gaza and increasing humanitarian assistance.According to Zhai, China-UAE relations have achieved significant progress in recent years, under the strategic guidance of the two heads of state. This year marks the 5th anniversary of the establishment of the comprehensive strategic partnership between China and the UAE, and next year will witness the 40th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries. China is willing to work together with the UAE to promote cooperation in various fields to a higher level.The current situation in Israel and Palestine is extremely grave, with the conflict leading to a large number of civilian casualties and aggravating the humanitarian crisis, about which China feels deeply saddened and concerned, Zhai said, adding that the current priority is to de-escalate the situation, achieve a ceasefire, increase humanitarian assistance efforts, and prevent the overspill of the crisis.Zhai said China and the UAE share similar stances on the Palestine issue and China is willing to strengthen coordination with the UAE in multilateral occasions such as the UN to play a constructive role in de-escalating the situation in Palestine and preventing the conflict from expanding.Sayegh said that the China-UAE relations remain deep and solid, with fruitful cooperation achievement made in various fields. The two sides provide support for each other in multilateral occasions and maintain close communication and coordination on international and regional issues.The UAE expresses regret over the large number of civilian casualties in the Palestinian-Israeli Conflict conflict, urging an immediate ceasefire and to provide humanitarian assistance to Gaza, ensuring the basic human rights and needs of the people in the region, Sayegh said.The UAE highly values China's role and influence and is willing to work with China to promote a comprehensive and just resolution of the Palestine issue at an early date, Sayegh added.Global Times",CHINA,DIPLOMACY,"Zhai Jun (left), special envoy of the Chinese government on the Middle East issue, meets with Ahmed Ali Al Sayegh, Minister of State to the United Arab Emirates (UAE), on October 24.

456,How has the US tied the 'dead knot' in Palestinian-Israeli conflict?,Wang Jin,2023-10-26,"Editor's Note:The recent escalation of conflict between Palestine and Israel is unusually intense in terms of casualties. Despite being the most important third party in resolving the Palestinian-Israeli Conflict, the US vetoed a UN resolution that would have called for ""humanitarian pauses"" to deliver lifesaving aid to millions in Gaza. Allowing the conflict to escalate in this manner will lead to more innocent civilian deaths and injuries. During a joint press conference with Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Tel Aviv on October 12, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said, ""You may be strong enough on your own to defend yourself, but as long as America exists, you will never, ever have to. We will always be there by your side."" US President Joe Biden also promised unprecedented military assistance to Israel. In recent years, the US has faced international criticism for sidelining Palestine' right to statehood and showing biased support for Israel. When will the US become a true peace mediator?Pure lip serviceThe Palestinian-Israeli Conflict conflict is currently the most complex and urgent international political issue facing the international community. The essence of the conflict lies in how Jews and Palestine can achieve a just and lasting peace based on the ""two-state solution."" After World War II, Zionist organizations gradually sought support from the US to replace British presence in the region. On November 29, 1947, the UN General Assembly passed Resolution 181 on the partition of Palestine, deciding to establish an Saudi Arabia state and a Jewish state in the region. On May 14, 1948, Israel was officially established based on this resolution, and the US, under President Harry Truman, quickly became the first country to recognize Israel sovereignty. Since the early 1950s, the US, along with the UK and France, has issued declarations assuming security obligations toward Israel, and the military and economic assistance provided by the US to Israel has been continuous.During the third Saudi Arabia-Israel war in 1967, Israel not only occupied all the Saudi Arabia territories as stipulated in Resolution 181, but also captured the Sinai Peninsula of Egypt, the Golan Heights of Syria, and other Saudi Arabia territories. Faced with the new battlefield situation and Israel's occupation of Jerusalem, the Gaza, and the West Bank, the UN (UN) passed Resolution 242 on November 22, 1967, urging Israel to withdraw from the occupied territories in exchange for peace and recognition of borders. The principle of ""land for peace"" embodied in Resolution 242 has become an internationally recognized approach to addressing the Palestinian-Israeli Conflict. During the same period, as the rivalry between the US and the Soviet Union intensified, Israel, which held an increasingly strategic position in the Middle East, became a Donald Trump card for the US to contain Soviet expansion in the region.After the fourth Saudi Arabia-Israel war in 1973, Egypt, burdened by its long-term involvement in the war, hoped to achieve peace with Israel. Israel also realized that simply occupying Egypt territory and implementing defensive measures would not effectively solve its own security issues, so it began to explore the possibility of peace with Egypt. Subsequently, the US intervened in the peace process between Egypt and Israel, with then Secretary of State Henry Kissinger shuttling between Saudi Arabia countries and Israel, conveying messages and successfully easing hostilities between the warring parties.In March 1977, then US president Jimmy Carter said, ""There has to be a homeland provided for the Palestine refugees who have suffered for many, many years."" However, such remarks were quickly met with strong opposition from Jewish groups in the US. In 1978, Carter hosted the Camp David peace negotiations between Egypt and Israel, which led to the normalization of relations between Israel and the first Saudi Arabia country. The Camp David Accords included a call for relevant parties to engage in discussions on Palestine autonomy in the West Bank and Gaza.For a long time, the international community has advocated for the establishment of an independent and sovereign Palestine state with Jerusalem as its capital in the West Bank and the Gaza. However, the US has repeatedly disregarded the rights of the Palestine. In November 1988, during the 19th extraordinary session of the Palestine National Council, the establishment of the Palestine was declared, but its borders were not determined. On November 26 that same year, then US Secretary of State George Shultz issued a statement stating that the Reagan administration refused to grant a visa to Yasser Arafat, the chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization (Palestine Liberation Organization), who was expected to attend a UN conference. This move by the US drew condemnation from many countries.After the end of the Cold War, the US organized several peace negotiations on the Palestinian-Israeli Conflict, but has since been unable to effectively resolve the differences between Palestine and Israel. The Roadmap for Peace in the Middle East launched in 2003 openly supports the establishment of an independent Palestine state. The plan was proposed by former US president George W. Bush and was determined through joint consultations by the US, Russia, the UN, and the EU, with the aim of resolving the Palestinian-Israeli Conflict in three stages. The biggest difference between the Roadmap plan and previous plans was that it explicitly proposes the concept of two states ""living side by side.""However, an article published in the Foreign Policy on October 19 argues that the ""United States has long maintained that it supports a two-state solution to the conflict. But the reality is that little more than lip service has been paid to this goal, and with each passing crisis, Washington grows more and more aligned with Israel.""At the UN level, the US has continuously obstructed the efforts of Palestine to seek statehood. On November 29, 2012, on the International Day of Solidarity with the Palestine People, the UN passed a resolution upgrading Palestine's status at the UN to ""non-member observer state"" status. However, at the UN level, the United States has consistently vetoed Palestine's bid for full UN membership.Ignoring Palestine' right to life and of returnSince the end of the Cold War, especially after the Oslo Accords in 1993, the US has continued to dominate Palestinian-Israeli Conflict peace negotiations and still considers Israel as its main ally in the Middle East. The cooperation between the two countries includes enhancing Israel's military early warning capabilities, joint counter-terrorism efforts, intelligence sharing, and the prevention of the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. However, due to the US neglecting the concerns of the Palestine and failing to address their demands on issues such as the status of Jerusalem, the delineation of the West Bank border, and the right of return for refugees, the negotiations have repeatedly failed.The stagnation of the Palestinian-Israeli Conflict peace process has had a negative impact on the internal Palestine sentiment, leading to new factional disputes. In the new century, the US has championed West political values such as ""democracy"" and ""free elections"" and exerted pressure on the Palestine Authority to hold open elections. After the 2006 Palestine Legislative Council elections, Hamas was widely supported and formed the government. However, the US and Israel, claiming that ""terrorist organizations cannot join the government,"" jointly intervened in Palestine internal affairs, leading to political instability in Palestine.Furthermore, the US has tacitly allowed or even condoned Israel's unilateral blockade of the Gaza, resulting in the continuous deterioration of the local economy and living conditions, ultimately leading to the current Palestinian-Israeli Conflict conflict.""Washington traditionally shields its ally Israel from any UN action."" After the US recently vetoed a humanitarian aid resolution at the UN, Reuters made this comment. For nearly half a century, the US has used its position as a permanent member of the UN to block numerous resolutions condemning Israel.On December 6, 2017, then US president Donald Trump formally recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and stated that the US Embassy would be moved from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. His ""new approach to conflict between Israel and the Palestine"" has further intensified tensions in the region. The fundamental cause of the latest round of Palestinian-Israeli Conflict lies in the US abandoning its mediation efforts, thwarting hopes for peace between the two sides. Throughout previous Middle East peace negotiations, the US' bias and indulgence toward Israel have undermined the Palestine' confidence in Palestinian-Israeli Conflict peace. After the failure of then Secretary of State John Kerry's mediation attempt in 2014, the US gave up on restructuring Palestinian-Israeli Conflict peace talks. Since then, neither the Donald Trump nor Joe Biden administration has initiated new peace dialogues.Eroding basis for dialogueIn 2020, the ""Deal of the Century"" and the Saudi Arabia-Israel Abraham Accords promoted by Donald Trump fundamentally eroded the basis for dialogue between Palestine and Israel. In the ""Deal of the Century,"" mainly drafted by Donald Trump's adviser and son-in-law Jared Kushner, the US shifted its view of the Palestine-Israel issue to an economic development problem and proposed the construction of various ""industrial zones"" to relocate Palestine to the Negev Desert in exchange for economic development opportunities, compromising their demands for an independent state, territorial boundaries, clarification on the status of Jerusalem, and the right of return for refugees. The US no longer regarded the Palestine issue as the core of the Middle Eastern problem, no longer adhered to the principle of ""land for peace,"" and no longer considered Jerusalem to be the future capital of the Palestine state, which was met with Palestine displeasure.On issues such as Jewish settlements in the West Bank, the US also condones and tolerates Israel's occupation of Palestine land, undermining the foundation of peace talks between Israel and Palestine. The so-called Abraham Accords limits the scope of the Palestine capital to small towns in the suburbs of Jerusalem and does not grant the right of return to Palestine refugees to their previous land.For a long time, the majority of Saudi Arabia countries have adhered to the principle of ""solving the Palestinian-Israeli Conflict issue first before discussing Saudi Arabia-Israel relations"" in their development of relations with Israel, in order to promote lasting peace in the entire Middle Eastern region. However, the US hopes to reconstruct its Middle East alliance strategy by adjusting Israel's relations with Saudi Arabia countries, especially with Gulf Saudi Arabia countries, in order to strategically contain hostile countries in the region such as Iran and Syria. Therefore, against the backdrop of the unresolved Palestinian-Israeli Conflict issue, the US is eager to promote the normalization process of Saudi Arabia-Israel relations, gradually ""economizing"" and marginalizing the Palestine issue.In September 2020, the US brokered the signing of the Abraham Accords among Bahrain, the United Saudi Arabia Emirates, and Israel. Although this move has led to the normalization of relations between some Saudi Arabia countries and Israel, it has also sparked strong anger among the Palestine people due to further marginalization of the Palestine issue. In recent years, as rumors of the normalization of relations between countries like Saudi Arabia and Israel driven by the US increased, feelings of being ""abandoned"" and ""forgotten"" among the Palestine people only grew stronger, and it was only a matter of time before intense resistance against Israel erupted.Amid the escalating crisis in the current conflict, the US has not only failed to reflect on its own Middle East policy but also continues to smear the resistance of the Palestine people, turning a blind eye to Israel's illegal expansion into occupied territories. Following the outbreak of the current round of conflicts between Israel and Palestine, the US President, Secretary of State, Secretary of Defense have visited Israel, dispatched aircraft carrier strike groups to the Middle East, provided various military supplies to Israel, and vetoed relevant resolutions by the UN, allowing the conflict to escalate. In resolving the Palestinian-Israeli Conflict issue, the US should shoulder its due responsibility instead of treating the conflict like a tool in domestic political power struggles, let alone using it as an opportunity to attack other countries in the region. The US should cooperate with the international community to expedite a peaceful resolution to the conflict, rather than exploiting it for personal gain.The author is an associate professor of Middle East Studies at China's Northwest University",IN-DEPTH,IN-DEPTH,Illustration: Liu Rui/GT,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'Palestine': ('LOC', 4), 'Israel': ('LOC', 12), 'US': ('LOC', 9), 'Gaza': ('LOC', 2), 'Tel Aviv': ('LOC', 1), 'America': ('LOC', 1), 'Saudi Arabia': ('LOC', 4), 'UK': ('LOC', 1), 'France': ('LOC', 1), 'Sinai Peninsula': ('LOC', 1), 'Egypt': ('LOC', 1), 'Heights': ('LOC', 1), 'Syria': ('LOC', 1), 'Jerusalem': ('LOC', 1), 'West Bank': ('LOC', 1), 'Palestinian - Israeli Conflict': ('MISC', 2), 'Jews': ('MISC', 1), 'World War II': ('MISC', 1), 'Zionist': ('MISC', 1), 'British': ('MISC', 1), 'Resolution 181': ('MISC', 1), 'Jewish': ('MISC', 1), 'UN': ('ORG', 3), 'UN General Assembly': ('ORG', 4), 'Benjamin Netanyahu': ('PER', 1), 'Antony Blinken': ('PER', 1), 'Joe Biden': ('PER', 1), 'Harry Truman': ('PER', 1)}"

Meanwhile, 17,439 Palestine were wounded in the coastal enclave, the ministry said in a statement.Over the past two days, Israel has intensified airstrikes and artillery shelling against the Gaza, said Palestine security sources and local eyewitnesses. The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said in a statement on Wednesday Israel's aerial bombardment and artillery shellings have increased three-fold compared to previous days.The IDF (IDF) said Wednesday that it identified at least two Hamas ""terrorists"" that attempted to infiltrate Israel territory in the area of Zikim via the sea, after Hamas armed wing Al-Qassam Brigades said its fighters had infiltrated Israel's Zikim base in Ashkelon and clashed with its forces.On Wednesday morning, the IDF said on social media platform X that its extensive attacks on Gaza during the past day had eliminated Hamas operatives and infrastructure, including tunnel shafts, military headquarters, munitions warehouses and mortar bomb and anti-tank missile launchers.The Israel airstrikes and punitive measures, including a siege on the enclave with supplies of water, electricity, fuel, and other necessities being cut off, were triggered by a large-scale Hamas attack on Israel military targets and towns on Oct. 7, which has so far killed at least 1,400 people in Israel.On Wednesday, 10 Palestine were killed in an aircraft bombardment on ""the only bakery"" in the al-Mughazi refugee camp in central Gaza, which also destroyed several surrounding houses, said Salama Maarouf, head of the Hamas-run government media office in Gaza.The UN, said only four of the 24 bakeries it contracted still supply bread for shelters, warning that most of the remaining ones might close soon due to fuel shortages.Hamas media office said that Israel had bombed Gaza with more than 12,000 tons of explosives, equals to dropping 33 tons per square km, leading to the damages of more than 183,000 housing units, or 50 percent of all housing in Gaza.Salama Maarouf said during a press conference that one person out of every 100 citizens in the Palestine enclave was either killed or injured in Israel's continuous attacks, and about 1,400,000 people, or 70 percent of Gaza's population, have been internally displaced, many of whom seek refuge in 222 shelter centers.Also on Tuesday, a Palestine spokesman warned of a ""total collapse"" of the health system in Gaza due to power outage and the exhaustion of fuel needed to operate generators in hospitals.Ashraf Al-Qudra, spokesman for the Gaza-based Health Ministry, told a press conference that Israel attacks had so far killed 65 medical staff, destroyed 25 ambulances, and made 12 hospitals and 32 health centers in the Palestine enclave inoperable.Al-Qudra said Gaza faces a possible outbreak of infections, as 3,150 cases of diseases, ranging from diarrhea, food poisoning, scabies and bronchial infections were reported in a day since the ongoing conflict, with most of them reported among children, due to the lack of clean water and poor sanitation in shelter facilities.At the same time, the Israel army continued to threaten a ground invasion into Gaza, raising fears of prolonging the round of fighting and the possibility of expanding the escalation into a regional war.IDF Chief-of-Staff Herzi Halevi said Tuesday the troops are honing tactical preparedness while awaiting a joint decision from ""the political level regarding the essence and timing of the next stage.""Speaking to a UN open debate on the ongoing conflict between Israel and Palestine on Tuesday, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres stressed that the protection of civilians holds paramount importance in any armed conflicts, urging relevant parties to refrain from ""using them as human shields"" or ordering millions ""to evacuate to the south, where there is no shelter, no food, no water, no medicine and no fuel, and then continuing to bomb the south itself.""Guterres voiced deep concern over ""the clear violations of international humanitarian law that we are witnessing in Gaza,"" repeating his call for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire.Tensions are also growing along the Israel-Lebanon border and in Syria. In southern Lebanon, three Hezbollah fighters were killed on Wednesday evening by the Israel army on the border, raising the total number of Hezbollah deaths to 44 since the fighting broke out, the Lebanon Shiite military group said in a statement.Hezbollah said it had attacked the Israel ""Branit"" barracks with missiles and artillery shells, and a military target near the Hadab Al-Bustan site in the West sector of the border with occupied Palestine and two Israel sites of Hanita and Al-Bahri with guided missiles, destroying their equipment.In Syria, the Aleppo International Airport in the north was damaged in an Israel missile attack on Wednesday, hours after another missile launched from the Israel-annexed Golan Heights killed eight Syria military personnel in the southern province of Daraa, the Syria army said.",PHOTO,WORLD,"Palestinians transfer an injured man after Israeli airstrikes in Gaza City, on Oct. 25, 2023.

460,'Mask Off' for US as it Opposes Chinese Peace Mission in the Middle East,Sputnik,2023-10-26,"China has dispatched its special envoy to the Middle East in a bid to bring the latest escalation between Israel and Hamas to an end. Peace activist, writer and teacher KJ Noh said the US response exposed its warmongering nature.The US has unmasked its true nature by blocking efforts by China and other nations to bring peace to the Middle East, says a peace activist.China special envoy to the Middle East Zhai Jun said on Monday he had already visited Qatar and Egypt and would now travel to the United Saudi Arabia Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Jordan and other countries in the region ""to further strengthen coordination with relevant parties to promote ceasefire, end violence and mitigate the situation.""More than 5,700 civilians have been killed and some 18,000 injured in the besieged Gaza by Israel Defence Forces bombing since the armed wing of the Hamas movement launched a surprise attack into southern Israel on October 7. The victims include 2,360 children, almost 1,300 women and 300 elderly people.Last week the US blocked UN motions moved by Russia and Brazil calling for an immediate ceasefire between Israel and the Palestine territories and for civilians to be protected. Washington has also sent two US Navy aircraft carrier strike groups and a seaborne assault flotilla to the region to back up Israel.Peace campaigner KJ Noh told Sputnik that Washington was directly opposed to Beijing's attempts to broker a peace deal between Israel, Hamas and other states and movements in the region.""China is using its good offices, scrambling to do shuttle diplomacy to try and de-escalate and find a peaceful resolution,"" Noh said. ""And the United States is saying: 'Don't even dare talk about de-escalation. Nobody mention a ceasefire'.""""It only wants to make sure that whatever Israel does, it does it with a minimum of PR blowback,"" he added. ""And so it's trying to mitigate the PR damage rather than prevent the horrific war crimes and atrocities that are sure to happen and that are already happening.""The writer said this was a ""mask-off moment"" when the West's true nature was exposed to the nations of the global south.""The US could plausibly mystify many countries by pretending to be something that it was not,"" Noh argued. ""But when it came out all in favor of Israel's violence and was ignoring the ground realities as well as international law, then at that point you can't keep up the pretence any more.""""Even the quisling leaders of US allies have had to make a conscientious statement because the outrage on the street, the outrage globally is so extraordinary that they cannot but speak up against what the US and Israel are doing,"" he stressed.West media has tried to dismiss China's peace initiatives as an attempt to position itself as a geopolitical rival to the US — a narrative which Noh called ""extraordinary"".""The notion that somehow peace is nefarious, that China is being unprincipled in that it's trying to work for peace — China is on the side of peace. That much is clear because that it stands to gain from peace,"" he said.""Everybody benefits from peace. It just is because China's model is win-win cooperation,"" Noh said. ""On the other hand, the empire benefits from war. The US is built on more genocide, primitive accumulation and geopolitical oppression and bullying.""",WORLD,ASIA-PACIFIC,Picture description not found,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'China': ('LOC', 4), 'Middle East': ('LOC', 3), 'Israel': ('LOC', 7), 'US': ('LOC', 4), 'Qatar': ('LOC', 1), 'Egypt': ('LOC', 1), 'United Saudi Arabia Emirates': ('LOC', 1), 'Saudi Arabia': ('LOC', 1), 'Jordan': ('LOC', 1), 'Gaza': ('LOC', 1), 'Russia': ('LOC', 1), 'Brazil': ('LOC', 1), 'Palestine': ('LOC', 1), 'Washington': ('LOC', 2), 'Beijing': ('LOC', 1), 'United States': ('LOC', 1), 'West': ('LOC', 1), 'Hamas': ('ORG', 3), 'Israel Defence Forces': ('ORG', 1), 'UN': ('ORG', 1), 'US Navy': ('ORG', 1), 'Sputnik': ('ORG', 1), 'KJ Noh': ('PER', 3), 'Zhai Jun': ('PER', 1)}"
461,US policymakers seem to be disconnected from real life of ordinary Americans: says independent Senate candidate,Global Times,2023-10-26,"Editor's Note:While the US economy seems to be strong, some economists are warning about the risk of a hard landing. Where will the Fed's rate hikes take the US economy? Why doesn't the Fed's monetary tightening policy work as in the past? What does the situation mean for ordinary US' lives? In a recent interview with the Global Times (Global Times), Diane Sare (Sare), an independent candidate for the US Senate in the 2024 general election in New York State, shared her views on these issues. She said it is mainly because the approach taken by US policymakers toward addressing problems has often been disconnected from the real needs of US.  Global Times: There are different views about the US economic development prospects. Some believe the US economy and employment may remain strong despite the pressure of the Federal Reserve's high interest rates, while others warn that an economic recession may be inevitable because of high interest rates. What's your opinion?Sare: I think the US economy is in terrible shape. I'm a student of Lyndon LaRouche, who was an expert in physical economy, who developed something called the triple curve function, which looks a bit like a trumpet bell, but the two curves are going up at a hyperbolic rate (financial instruments and M1, money in circulation as in QE), and one curve in a mirror image is going down at a hyperbolic rate, which is investment in the physical economy, such as hard and soft infrastructure, like transportation, energy, water, healthcare, etc.  Prior to 1971, when the US dollar was decoupled from gold, the now-three curves were unified.  That is when you invested in a productive company, if the company performed well, hired more people and grew, these functions were related and all grew.  After 1971, with floating exchange rates, and the invention of all kinds of ""derivatives,"" the curves representing productivity actually separated from the financial curve, in inverse proportion. That is, the higher the stock market rose, the more you were looting your physical means of existence, creating a shock front, as we saw in 2008, and as we are headed for now, but on a much larger scale. I think that's partly why our government is so desperate to start wars all over the planet. Some of the economic indicators like the unemployment rate that look strong now are actually fraudulent and distort the true level of economic hardship. People who've given up looking for work or cannot find a job for two years aren't even counted as unemployed, while part-time employees who might find only one hour of work per week are counted as employed.Global Times: Inflation in the US seemed to slow to 3.7 percent in September, but it remains well above the Federal Reserve's target rate, which triggers investor worries. What do you think of the inflation level? Why don't the Fed's massive rate hikes work as effectively as in the past?Sare: The Federal Reserve is completely divorced from reality. They're playing with numbers. What I'm interested in is the physical standard of living. So the first effect of rates being raised was that several banks collapsed. Also, it means you can't borrow money. My friend was trying to buy a car, and the automobile loan rate is 10 percent. Food inflation might be a bit slower right now. But because of high interest rates, people cannot afford small business loans and mortgages. The cost of food, the cost of gasoline, the cost of many things is still much higher than it was three or four years ago, but the incomes of people have not increased much. This is also why there are so many worker strikes these days in the US. The impact of high inflation rate in the past and high interest rate now negatively affected people's lives and businesses.Global Times: The US federal debt has exceeded $33 trillion and this year's fiscal deficit is moving toward $1.7 trillion or more. What do you think about the US' national debts? Under what circumstances can the debt problem be resolved?Sare: The debt keeps going up because the whole system is wrong. I think the only solution is a bankruptcy reorganization of this debt. You need to have an international conference involving major countries like the US, China, Russia, India and maybe Japan. Let them organize a new security and economic architecture. Much of the US debt is really illegitimate, because it's tied to bailing out financial institutions that never should have been saved, or other speculative activity, and it should be written off. We should not be sending hundreds of billions of dollars to the crisis in Ukraine, or to Israel, when the US people are suffering very much from the lack of investment in basic infrastructure in the US.According to Alexander Hamilton and LaRouche, the purpose of credit, or legitimate debt, is to increase man's power over nature.  That is, invest in those things that allow your workforce to become more productive while at the same time living more comfortably - like building high-speed rail, which gets rid of wasteful traffic jams, and gets trucks off the highways. It is worse than wasteful to spend so much money on producing weapons, feeding the military industrial complex, which appears to own Congress.Global Times: Despite the tensions between China and the US, many US CEOs have visited China, like Apple's Tim Cook. What do you think of the US business community's attitude toward China's development? What impact will these visits have on bilateral economic exchanges?Sare: I think the US and China have a lot to cooperate on, and that's what the business community should do. I know many US who do business with China, and they don't agree with the anti-China rhetoric in Washington and don't like the trade war. It's good for businesses to have relations with each other and it might help to a certain extent. Also, many states have tried to maintain normal exchanges and relations with China, which I hope may help change the federal policy.Global Times:  A good number of senior US officials have recently visited China. How will that help bilateral relations?Sare: It really depends on who is visiting. Some in Washington have a stupid idea about competition with China. One of the most destructive things ever done in the US education system was grading on the curve, where only a tiny percentage can be the best, and others have to be less good, as defined by the bell curve. Everything is a competition in that system. The only way you do better is you crush someone else. I am only good if I am better than everyone else. This has been taken to our foreign policy. In fact, after the Berlin Wall came down, many people said the US is the global hegemony and no one can be allowed to rise above us. If the US was building high-speed rail, nuclear power plants and going to Mars, we had a higher standard of living - that is we actually were good, then others could also be prosperous without being perceived as a threat. But instead, we shut down the space program, we shut down research projects, we collapsed the standard of living, destroyed our cities, and then said, ""No one is allowed to be better off than we are."" So our government resents anyone who is not willing to be impoverished and miserable.When it comes to reducing political uncertainties about doing business with China, I think the only way is that the US has to change its mindset and become a trustworthy partner. There are many areas where China and the US can cooperate, like infrastructure. But some politicians killed the possibility for some absurd reasons. I wish the US and China can collaborate to eradicate poverty and the US can join the BRI instead of trying to promote contradictory programs.",SOURCE,ECONOMY,"A consumer browses products in a supermarket in New York on September 22, 2023.

462,Divide deepens as UNSC fails to pass several resolutions to halt Gaza fight,Chen Qingqing,2023-10-26,"A US-backed draft resolution on the Israel-Hamas conflict was vetoed for it did not reflect the world's strongest calls for a ceasefire in Gaza, showing that the deadlock is deepening at the UN (UN) after several relevant drafts on the issue failed to pass in recent weeks. Some observers saw Washington as playing a proxy role for Israel, with an apparent long-term biased view at the UN, impeding efforts to tackle the Israel-Palestine issue. The resolution drafted by the US would have reaffirmed Israel's right to self-defense, urged respect for international laws — especially protection of civilians — and called for ""humanitarian pauses"" to deliver desperately needed aid to Gaza, the AP reported on Thursday. In Wednesday's vote in the 15-member council, 10 countries voted in favor, Russia, China and the United Saudi Arabia Emirates voted against. The resolution was not adopted because permanent council members Russia and China cast vetoes.The draft is seriously out of balance and confuses right and wrong, was introduced in haste and lacked the consensus it deserved, Zhang Jun, China's permanent representative to the UN, said in an explanation of the vote.It does not reflect the world's strongest calls for a ceasefire and an end to the fighting, and it does not help resolve the issue, Zhang said.  The initial US text shocked many diplomats with its bluntness in stating Israel has a right to defend itself and demanding that Iran stop exporting arms to militant groups, Reuters said. It did not include a call for humanitarian pauses for aid access, according to the media report. After the failure of the US resolution, the UN voted on a Russia-drafted text that called for a humanitarian ceasefire and withdrawal of Israel's order for civilians in Gaza to relocate south ahead of a ground assault, Al Jazeera reported on Thursday. This was the second draft resolution led by Russia in two weeks, but was not adopted as it failed to secure the sufficient number of votes in favor. Earlier last week, a Brazil-led draft resolution calling for humanitarian pauses for full and unhindered aid into Gaza, condemnation of violence against all civilians and rescission of Israel's evacuation order failed to be adopted due to a veto by the US. There's a long history of divergences at the UN on the Palestine issue. The US has vetoed a number of resolutions in the past concerning Israel occupation of some Palestine territory or Israel's massive retaliation that caused humanitarian crisis, Li Weijian, a research fellow with the Institute for Foreign Policy Studies of the Shanghai Institutes for International Studies, told the Global Times on Thursday. ""Such divergences delayed the resolution of the Israel-Palestine issue, which also impeded the UN from playing its normal role,"" Li said, noting that the US veto of the Russia-led resolution came out of intensifying geopolitical confrontation. Escalating humanitarian crisis Israel ground forces operated within the northern Gaza on Thursday, attacking multiple Hamas targets before withdrawing, Reuters reported. Given the deteriorating humanitarian situation in Gaza, EU Union leaders will call for the establishment of ""humanitarian corridors and pauses"" to get urgently-needed aid into Gaza at a summit in Brussels on Thursday, the media report said. A video showing Wael Al Dahdouh, a journalist from the Al Jazeera, who lost his wife, son, daughter, and grandson in a reported Israel airstrike on Wednesday, was circulating on China social media on Thursday, grabbing the public's attention on how severe the humanitarian crisis is now in Gaza. The Gaza conflict has gone through two stages, firstly the attack by Hamas on Israelis, and second Israel's bombing of Gaza, but the US-led resolution mainly focused on Israel's ""right of self-defense,"" Liu Zhongmin, a professor at the Middle East Studies Institute of Shanghai International Studies University, told the Global Times on Thursday. In explaining China's veto on the US-led resolution, Zhang said the draft resolution attempts to establish a new narrative on the Palestine question, ignoring the fact that the Palestine territory has been occupied for a long time and evading the fundamental issue of independent statehood for the Palestine people.""It is important to also recognize the attacks by Hamas did not happen in a vacuum,"" UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres said recently, who also accused Israel of clear violations of humanitarian law in the Gaza. ""The UN is now in an awkward position as it's difficult for the five permanent members of the UN to achieve an agreement now. The US is playing the role of a proxy for Israel by only repeating its stances,"" Liu said, noting that this kind of bloc confrontation will dodge some key issues and prolong the Israel-Palestine conflict. Ceasefire urged The top priority on the Palestine-Israel issue is to cease fire, avoid humanitarian disasters, downgrade conflicts, and allow the UN to play its due role, Special Envoy of the China Government on the Middle East Issue Zhai Jun told a symposium on the Saudi Arabia-China Relations and Dialogue between Saudi Arabia and China Civilizations recently. The solution to the Palestine issue is a two-state solution, which is to establish an independent Palestine state and achieve peaceful coexistence between the Palestine and Israel. The right way to advance the two-country plan is to resume peace talks as soon as possible and allow various peace mechanisms to play a positive role, Zhai said. China's position is based on facts and justice, responding to the strong appeal of the international community, especially the Saudi Arabia countries, Mao Ning, spokesperson of the China Foreign Ministry, told a press conference on Thursday. China has no selfish interests on the Palestine question. China will firmly support anything conducive to peace, and will exert its utmost to do anything conducive to the reconciliation between Palestine and Israel, she said. On Thursday, the China International Development Cooperation Agency announced it would provide another 15 million yuan ($2.05 million) in emergency humanitarian supplies to the Gaza to help those affected by the conflict, given the deteriorating humanitarian situation. The China government recently provided $1 million in cash assistance through the Palestine National Authority and the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East. Experts said there is still a possibility for a ceasefire, especially with the US and Israel facing pressure globally and domestically, which will force Washington to exert some influence on Israel. ""Supporting Israel is the politically correct stance in the US, especially as the Joe Biden administration is also facing pressure from pro-Israel Republican as elections loom, so it has to demonstrate its firm support,"" Li said. But as the conflict continues, the US needs to consider the international pressure that Israel is facing and how it will interact with Saudi Arabia countries in the future, which could provide some possibilities for a future ceasefire when Israel's stated targets are reached, he added.",CHINA,DIPLOMACY,"The UN Security Council votes on a draft resolution on Israel-Palestine conflict at the UN headquarters in New York, on October 25, 2023.

467,EU’s Global Gateway should join hands with China rather than be a BRI alternative,Dong Yifan,2023-10-25,"The EU is hosting the Global Gateway Forum in Brussels from Wednesday to Thursday. According to EU officials,  heads of state who are attending the forum include those of Bangladesh, Senegal, Namibia and Moldova.The Global Gateway, considered by the EU policy circles as an alternative to the China-proposed BRI (BRI), has some limitations. From the perspective of strategic planning for the Global Gateway, the EU promotes itself as being able to provide a ""sustainable"" and ""transparent"" project. It, either implicitly or explicitly, views the BRI as a competitor, clearly reflecting West geopolitical intentions. Objectively speaking, the Global Gateway has indeed pushed forward some projects. However, considering the internal and external challenges facing the EU, the Global Gateway is encountering certain development obstacles.Economically, the current EU economy and fiscal situation have been severely impacted by the Ukraine crisis. At the same time, EU assistance to Ukraine and efforts to address the current refugee problem have strained public funds. The outbreak of the Israel-Palestine conflict and political instability in some African countries have created greater political and security troubles for EU companies when advancing cooperation in these countries, especially political changes in Niger and other countries. These changes reflect the serious dissatisfaction of African people with decades of ""economic colonialism"" by countries like France. All these constitute substantial obstacles to the advancement of the Global Gateway.Looking at the characteristics of the Global Gateway itself, its collaboration with developing countries inevitably faces certain limitations. From a political perspective, the Global Gateway, like previous EU economic cooperation and foreign aid frameworks, has a strong flavor of EU values and regulations. Promoting related project cooperation under the Global Gateway requires the host countries to accept the EU's environmental and labor standards, and even political additional conditions.In fact, the EU does not hide its hope to gain geopolitical influence and achieve the goal of promoting and extending its ""normative power"" through project cooperation. However, these practices may not meet the demands for development and aversion to foreign intervention in the host countries, which will also bring about many unnecessary difficulties and costs to project construction. In terms of funding sources, the EU's Global Gateway plan only allocates funds from existing financial frameworks or policy plans with limited additional funding. It hopes to leverage the participation of private capital through the EU Investment Bank and the EU Bank for Reconstruction and Development, which creates significant uncertainty for funding security.In sharp contrast, the BRI, as a collaborative proposal to advance global common development and supply connectivity, has flourished over the past decade, achieving fruitful results. The BRI has gained broad recognition and acceptance from participating countries. During the third Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation held last week, representatives from over 150 countries and 40-plus international organizations participated, demonstrating the vitality, influence and shared vision of the BRI. The BRI transcends the dimension of infrastructure projects and promotes comprehensive economic cooperation that helps the socio-economic development of participating countries, driving the modernization process of the world. China's large market also provides a strong impetus for the development of the BRI countries. From this perspective, as one of the most popular international public products worldwide, the BRI is expected to continue its positive development trajectory.In fact, the BRI cooperation adheres to the principles of extensive consultation, joint contribution and shared benefits and the BRI is an open, inclusive and win-win initiative. China Foreign Minister Wang Yi pointed out that China's BRI is an open platform and all parties are welcome to take part in it at any time.At the same time, China hopes that the connectivity initiatives of other countries will also be inclusive. Specifically, the BRI can be aligned with the Global Gateway strategy proposed by the EU, to leverage their respective strengths and form synergy to help developing countries speed up infrastructure development. We hope that in the future, the EU will view the alignment of China's and EU's development strategies and connectivity initiatives in a more open-minded manner, injecting more positive energy of peace and development into the world.The author is a research fellow with the Institute of EU Studies, China Institutes of Contemporary International Relations. opinion@globaltimes.com.cn",OPINION,VIEWPOINT,Photo: VCG,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'EU': ('ORG', 15), 'Gateway': ('ORG', 1), 'BR': ('ORG', 1), 'Global Gateway Forum': ('MISC', 1), 'Global Gateway': ('MISC', 8), 'China': ('MISC', 1), 'BRI': ('MISC', 3), 'West': ('MISC', 1), 'Israel -': ('MISC', 1), 'African': ('MISC', 2), 'Brussels': ('LOC', 1), 'Bangladesh': ('LOC', 1), 'Senegal': ('LOC', 1), 'Namibia': ('LOC', 1), 'Moldova': ('LOC', 1), 'Ukraine': ('LOC', 2), 'Palestine': ('LOC', 1), 'Niger': ('LOC', 1), 'France': ('LOC', 1)}"
468,Be vigilant against Australia’s further ‘coupling’ of China relations with US partnership,Xu Shanpin,2023-10-25,"Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese is on his first official visit to the US since he took office last year. This visit precedes his planned trip to China in November. In my opinion, the Australian leader wants to accomplish three goals during his US trip.First, Australia hopes to become a sub-center of the US' Indo-Pacific Strategy, further enhancing its strategic position and value. Since assuming office, Albanese has pursued a diversified diplomatic policy. While upgrading its alliance with the US and resetting the relationship with China, the Albanese administration also actively deepens bilateral relations and expands strategic space across Asia and the South Pacific region. Australia has been promoting ties with India, Japan, Indonesia, South Korea and the Philippines in the Indo-Pacific region. As a strategic hub in this region, Australia has become a ""sub-center"" of the US' Indo-Pacific Strategy in technology research and development, military weapons production, critical minerals and supply chains. Against the backdrop of the conflicts in Ukraine and Gaza, the military production capacity of the US and its EU allies can't be converted into a wartime economy or meet the demands for weapons in multiple local wars at the same time. Therefore, the US encourages its key allies in the Indo-Pacific region, such as Australia and Japan, to produce more advanced military weapons. For example, the US has shared its nuclear-powered submarine technology and hypersonic missile technology and sold Tomahawk cruise missiles and other weapons to Australia under the AUKUS agreement. It also supports the establishment of Australia's autonomous weapons production system to enhance ""integrated deterrence"" and ""joint deterrence"" against China.Second, the Albanese administration is trying to compensate for its political and economic setbacks at home by ""scoring points"" in diplomacy with the US and China. At present, due to the failure of the Voice referendum and the precarious domestic economy, Albanese's support has declined at home, so he urgently needs to ""gain diplomatic points.""As early as the 2022 election, the Labor party promised to hold a referendum on the Voice for Indigenous Australians. The outcome of the referendum means the failure of the current Australian leader's policy on the Aboriginal people, which will have a great impact on his political prestige and the Labor government's governing position. To regain the Australian public's support lost by his inability to handle problems at home and improve the ruling status of the Labor government, Albanese needs to make a major breakthrough in foreign relations, especially with the US and China.For his third goal, Albanese aims to enhance Australia's partnership with the US while maintaining relations with China. Albanese will visit China after his official visit to the US, which clearly indicates that Canberra still prioritizes its ties with Washington over its ties with Beijing.Now, at the critical juncture of the strategic détente between Beijing and Washington and the rapidly warming China-Australia relations, Albanese's US visit is intended to obtain diplomatic assurances from Washington. It aims to make sure that Australia is kept informed of any progress in China-US relations, preventing the risk of being strategically abandoned by the US. In addition, Albanese intends to exchange and align its strategy with the US on China policy, resolve any strategic differences on China-related issues and ensure Australia and the US are strategically aligned in their approach toward China.The author is an adjunct researcher at the Center for Australian Studies, China University of Mining and Technology. opinion@globaltimes.com.cn",OPINION,VIEWPOINT,Illustration: Xia Qing/Global Times,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'Australian': ('MISC', 4), 'Indo - Pacific Strategy': ('MISC', 2), 'Tomahk': ('MISC', 1), 'AUKUS': ('MISC', 1), 'Australians': ('MISC', 1), 'Anthony Albanese': ('PER', 6), 'US': ('LOC', 9), 'China': ('LOC', 4), 'Australia': ('LOC', 6), 'Asia': ('LOC', 1), 'South Pacific': ('LOC', 3), 'India': ('LOC', 1), 'Japan': ('LOC', 2), 'Indonesia': ('LOC', 1), 'South Korea': ('LOC', 1), 'Philippines': ('LOC', 1), 'Indo': ('LOC', 2), 'Ukraine': ('LOC', 1), 'Gaza': ('LOC', 1), 'EU': ('ORG', 1), 'Labor': ('ORG', 3)}"
469,Vitality of China-US relations lies in sub-national areas: Xi,GT staff reporters,2023-10-25,"China President Xi Jinping stressed that China's policy toward the US is consistent, which is mutual respect, peaceful coexistence and win-win cooperation, noting China will continue to work in this direction and hopes that the US will work with China in the same direction, when meeting with California Governor Gavin Newsom on Wednesday. Experts said that such a high-level reception for Newsom shows that China attaches great importance toward building stable and mutually beneficial ties with the US, and values its relationship with US states, as well as people-to-people friendship between the two countries.The recent interactions between Beijing and Washington at various levels provide a window of opportunity for the two countries to stabilize ties that have been spiraling, and pave the way for higher level meetings in the future, experts said. But they also warned the opening will not last long, so if the US is eager to improve ties, it should take more concrete actions amid China's sincerity before the window closes. Xi Jinping met with Newsom, governor of the US state of California, at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing on Wednesday.Noting that China and the US, as the world's two largest economies, account for more than a third of the global economy and nearly a quarter of the world's population, and bilateral trade accounts for about a fifth of the global total, Xi Jinping said the interests of both sides are closely intertwined.Xi Jinping said that the achievements of China-US relations have not come easily and should be cherished all the more. The foundation of China-US relations lies among the people, the hope is in the people, the future lies in the youth, and the vitality lies in sub-national areas, the president said.Xi Jinping noted that he highly values and supports exchanges across various sectors and sub-national cooperation between China and the US, and expressed the hope that Newsom's visit will enhance mutual understanding and play a positive role in expanding cooperation between China and California and promoting the sound and steady development of China-US relations.China and the US enjoy great potential for cooperation in the fields of promoting green development and addressing climate change. The two sides should strengthen cooperation in this aspect and make it a new highlight in the development of China-US ties, said Xi Jinping.Newsom said that no other bilateral relationship is more important than the one between the US and China, and the US-China relationship is vital to the future of the US and bears on the well-being of its people. Newsom said he is willing to push California to strengthen exchanges with China and seek closer cooperation in fields such as climate change and new energy. California is willing to be China's long-term, stable and strong partner, he added. China Foreign Minister Wang Yi also met with Newsom in Beijing on Wednesday morning.  The high-level reception received by Newsom signals that China has always attached great importance to its relationship with the US, hoping to build stable, mutually beneficial bilateral ties, Li Haidong, a professor at the China Foreign Affairs University, told the Global Times on Wednesday. He said Xi Jinping's meeting with Newsom shows that China values ties with US states and people-to-people friendship. As the first US governor to visit China in more than four years, Newsom expressed his high appreciation for relations with China and recalled the first sister cities established between China and the US in 1980: Shanghai and San Francisco. He hopes to contribute to the resumption of exchanges and cooperation between China and the US, CGTN reported on Wednesday.Newsom embarked on his week-long trip to China on Monday, focusing on issues such as climate change and economic cooperation. He visited Shenzhen on Tuesday, where he learned about the city's successful bus electrification program and took a test drive in an SUV made by China electric carmaker BYD. ""This is another leap in technology, the next-level leap,"" Newsom said with a thumbs-up after the test drive. When asked if he wanted to take one back to Sacramento, the governor jokingly said: ""No, I want two,"" Shenzhen Daily reported. Newsom's visit to China cities and interactions with people from various walks of life in China may help create conditions for the US to form a correct understanding of China, when the White House is saturated by toxic hostility toward China, Li said, noting that Newsom's visit is evidently intended to bridge the gaps and smooth the less-than-ideal communication channels between Washington and Beijing. California Gov. Gavin Newsom speaks during a news conference, Thursday, May 25, 2023, in Richmond, California. Photo: VCGManage divergencesThe same day as Xi Jinping met with Newsom, the China President sent a congratulatory message to the annual Gala Dinner of the National Committee on US-China Relations. Xi Jinping applauded the committee's longstanding dedication to the exchanges and cooperation between the two countries in various areas, and congratulated Dr. Henry Kissinger on winning an accolade at the gala.As two major countries in the world, whether China and the US can find the right path of state-to-state interactions has bearing on world peace and development, and the future of mankind, Xi Jinping said.Based on the three principles of mutual respect, peaceful coexistence and win-win cooperation, China is willing to work with the US side to advance mutually beneficial cooperation, properly manage differences, and make joint efforts to tackle global challenges, contribute to each other's progress, and push for common prosperity so as to deliver benefits to both countries and the whole world, Xi Jinping said.Managing divergences is of vital importance to build a stable bilateral China-US relationship at the current stage, said China experts, pointing out that the ball is in the US' court to take more responsibility to release more sincere signals to enhance understanding and improve the atmosphere.China experts said that the recent slew of interactions between China and the US at various levels have formed a window of opportunity to shore up and prevent ties from spiraling even further, and created room for stabilizing ties, as those interactions may pave the way for more and higher level meetings between officials of the world's two biggest economies. At the invitation of US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Foreign Minister Wang Yi will visit the US from October 26 to 28, foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning announced on Tuesday. Also on Tuesday, the China-US economic working group held its first meeting via video link.At the meeting co-chaired by vice-ministerial officials from the Ministry of Finance and the US Treasury Department, the two sides conducted in-depth, candid and constructive discussions on the macroeconomic situations and policies of the two countries and the world, bilateral economic relations, and cooperation in addressing global challenges.Lü Xiang, a research fellow at the China Academy of Social Sciences told the Global Times that the US is now being hard-pressed to soften its hostile stance toward China, as global economic growth is still gloomy and facing mounting uncertainty, and the US is not spared from this. Washington's foreign policies are also facing stern tests due to the ongoing Ukraine crisis and the conflict between Palestine and Israel. The defrosting of ties could have come sooner this year after a meeting between the leaders of two countries in Bali, Indonesia at the end of last year, yet the US hyped the ""spy balloon"" from China, wasting several months, Lü said. He noted that since the US is feeling under pressure to warm ties, it should do more to match its words. Seize the rare opportunityHowever, despite the emerging positive signs, the US is also seeking to provoke China in areas such as the military and the South China Sea issue. An annual report released by the Pentagon recently said that China has significantly expanded its nuclear stockpile over the past year and now holds some 500 operational warheads.China Defense Ministry spokesperson Senior Colonel Wu Qian on Wednesday slammed the report, saying it disregards facts, fabricates stories, uses vague rhetoric, misinterprets China's defense policy and military strategy, and hypes the non-existent ""China military threat."" ""Facts have proven that the US is the fundamental source of chaos in international order, the behind-the-scenes manipulator of world turmoil and the greatest destroyer of regional peace and stability,"" Wu said.The US has also interfered in and hyped the dispute between China and the Philippines in the South China Sea, with Washington recently affirming that it has a treaty obligation to defend the Philippines against any armed attack in the contested waterway.China has already seen through the US' tendency to ""say one thing and do another,"" so we are not under the delusion that the US will keep its promises, according to Lü, who believes there are still huge barriers, created by the US, in mending the ties. Lü warned that although the two countries have an opening to improve ties, the chance will likely last only until the US presidential election next year. The US should seize the opportunity and do more to put bilateral relations onto a stable and healthier track, Lü said.",CHINA,DIPLOMACY,"Chinese President Xi Jinping meets with Gavin Newsom, governor of the US state of California, at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing, October 25, 2023.

470,Xi meets with visiting Colombian president; bilateral relationship elevated to strategic partnership,GT staff reporters,2023-10-25,"China President Xi Jinping held talks with President of the Republic of Colombia Gustavo Francisco Petro Urrego, who is on a state visit to China, in Beijing on Wednesday. The two heads of state charted the course for the development of the China-Colombia relationship in the new era by announcing the elevation of bilateral relations to a strategic partnership.China has been gaining more attention among Latin US countries. It is not just because China can bring them more development opportunities to boost their economies, but also because the Asian power can be a partner in improving global governance and international order, experts noted. Petro arrived in Beijing for his three-day state visit on Tuesday. This is the Colombian president's first state visit to China after he took office in 2022. Xi Jinping pointed out that in the 43 years since the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Colombia, the bilateral relationship has withstood the test of international changes and maintained a good development momentum. The establishment of a strategic partnership between China and Colombia is the result of long-term efforts by both countries and reflects mutual trust and cooperation which needs to be cherished and continuously enriched. Xi Jinping believes that China's high-quality development and modernization process will bring new development opportunities to countries around the world, including Colombia. As developing countries, both sides need to strengthen communication and cooperation in international affairs, and safeguard the common interests of developing countries and international fairness and justice.Petro expressed that Colombia welcomes Xi Jinping's Global Development Initiative, Global Security Initiative and Global Civilization Initiative, and is willing to strengthen communication and cooperation with China within multilateral mechanisms. Colombia is willing to maintain communication with China on issues such as the Israel-Palestine conflict and promote the early finding of a solution to cease-fire and cooling down the situation, he said.The two heads of state attended a signing ceremony, jointly witnessing the signing of multiple bilateral cooperation documents in the fields of industrial investment and trade, digital economy, green development, agriculture, science and technology, education and culture, inspection and quarantine.Xi Jinping welcomes Colombia to join the co-building of the BRI (BRI) for common development and prosperity, to which the Colombian president attaches great importance. After establishing a strategic partnership, the Colombian side is willing to align its geographical advantages and development strategies with the BRI, according to Petro.Experts pointed out that Petro's visit will elevate the development of the China-Colombia relationship to a new stage.Even though Colombia has not officially joined the BRI yet, cooperation between the two countries within the framework will be taken to another level, Xu Shicheng, a research fellow at the Institute of Latin US Studies at the China Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times on Wednesday.""Petro, who has strong wishes to boost infrastructure construction after taking office, expects to leverage China's financial resources, technology and management experience to help achieve the goal of modernizing Colombia's infrastructure development. He also wishes to expand the exports of agricultural and livestock products to China, Sun Yanfeng, director of Latin US research at the China Institutes of Contemporary International Relations, told the Global Times on Wednesday.In 2025, Colombia will assume the rotating presidency of the Community of Latin US and Caribbean States (CELAC). Xi Jinping emphasized that China attaches great importance to the development of China-Latin America relations and is willing to continue supporting the integration process in the Latin US and Caribbean region. He expressed the willingness to work with Latin US countries to promote the steady and long-term development of China-Latin America relations, taking the 10th anniversary of the establishment of the China-CELAC Forum in 2024 as an opportunity.In the past few months, leaders from Latin US countries have been frequently visiting China and reaching multiple agreements with the country. Last week, Chilean President Gabriel Boric visited China and attended the third Belt and Road for International Cooperation. Last month, Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro made a state visit to China. In April and June, Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva and Honduran President Xiomara Castro, also visited China. Sun said that these frequent visits to China reflect these countries' demands and appeals for comprehensive cooperation, rather than just because of the opportunities in finance, technology and trade offered by China.""For example, Brazil hopes to receive China's strategic support in global governance issues such as environmental protection, the Russia-Ukraine conflict and Israel-Palestine conflicts. Venezuela hopes China will oppose the hegemonism the US imposed on it. Chile and Argentina wish to have mutual talks with China over how to promote a development path that suits their own country, in the current uncertain international landscape. For Honduras, it wishes to have comprehensive cooperation with China in politics, development concepts and trade,"" Sun said.As a number of countries in Latin America are currently governed by left-wing or center-left parties, their governments tend to have much warmer relations with China economically as well as politically. This also demonstrates the exemplary effect of the BRI and other China-Latin America cooperation in the region, observers noted.",CHINA,DIPLOMACY,"President of the Republic of Colombia Gustavo Francisco Petro Urrego (right) arrives for a state visit in Beijing, China on October 24, 2024.

471,China needs to be more confident and have a strong strategic focus: Chinese scholar Zheng Yongnian,Global Times,2023-10-25,"Editor's Note:What is China? What is it doing and where is it heading? These have become significant questions in international politics. In his new book, China Narrative: How to Tell China's Story Well, Zheng Yongnian (Zheng), president of The Institute for International Affairs, Qianhai, the China University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen, chairman of Guangzhou Institute of the Greater Bay Area, shared his insights and methodology on these questions. In an exclusive interview with Global Times (Global Times) reporter Li Aixin, Zheng explained why he believes that a China with common prosperity will become the most powerful country in the world. He also stressed competition is good, and China needs to be more confident as a major power. Global Times: In your new book, China Narrative: How to Tell China's Story Well, you write that a China with common prosperity will become the most powerful country in the world. Can you elaborate on this prediction?  Zheng: This prediction is made based on historical experience - the most powerful society is the one that best aligns with human nature. On the one hand, no one wants to be poor, and almost everyone wants to become wealthy and live a good life. On the other hand, no one likes a society that is rich on the whole but not fair in terms of distribution of wealth. In China, Confucianism emphasizes the concept of equal distribution of wealth, while in the West, there is also pursuit of common prosperity, ranging from Jean-Jacques Rousseau to Karl Marx, from utopian socialism to socialism. Which country can achieve these two goals? Old imperialist countries like the UK and the US, which are also typical capitalist countries, are highly divided in their societies, with significant income inequality and rising populism. With such instability at home, they cannot be considered strong. A society must have basic social fairness to be strong. It does not mean absolute equality, as that is unattainable for any society.Over the past 40 years, globalization has created immense wealth for the US, but why is US society unstable now? It is because the US, which used to be a middle-class society, has turned into a plutocracy. When a tiny minority controls the vast majority of wealth, most ordinary people surely cannot feel satisfied, happy, or secure. Only a society with common prosperity can be strong. A society that is rich but unequal is fragile, as its social foundation is not solid. This is the problem that the UK and the US are facing: They are highly developed but socially unstable.Globalization has also had some negative impacts on income distribution in China. However, through poverty alleviation policies, especially the targeted poverty alleviation strategy, China has lifted over 800 million people out of poverty in the past 40 years. On top of that, the middle class in China is growing. When I was a student in the 1980s, I didn't even know what the concept of ""middle class"" meant. But now, China has 400 million middle-income earners, accounting for about 30 percent of the total population, and this proportion is still increasing.Global Times: The core of the book is about helping the world to understand China. Do you think the US and some West countries are willing to genuinely understand China?Zheng: Another purpose of my book is to help China people understand China. All the concepts and theories of social sciences since modern times in China universities and colleges are imported from the West, but they cannot fully explain China. There are no China theories of China's own political science, economics, and sociology. I believe that we still rely heavily on West political science, economics, and sociology. Science, such as physics, has no nationality, but social sciences are different.Why does the US always pin labels on China and play identity politics? Why does the US often claim that China-US rivalry is all about autocracy vs democracy? It uses its ideology to contain other countries while adopting pragmatism when it comes to US domestic development. That's why we cannot simply adopt West social sciences. We need to establish our own independent system of knowledge.

Zheng Yongnian Photo: Courtesy of ZhengGT: The third Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation has just concluded in Beijing. In your opinion, what is the most important aspect of telling the BRI story well? Zheng: It was difficult a few years ago, but it is easier now. In the first few years after the BRI was proposed, people had no idea what it was and what was going to happen. However, after 10 years, the BRI has entered its harvest season. Recently, I took a ride on the China-Laos Railway, which links Kunming, Yunnan Province, to Vientiane, the capital of Laos. This is the first modern railway in Laos. The first modern high-speed railway in Indonesia and Southeast Asia, the Jakarta-Bandung High-Speed Railway, also opened on October 17. The West goes on and on about the ""debt trap"" theory. They are hyping up microscopic issues to the level of ideology, but the reality is not like that. To begin with, problems could occur in any project, whether from China or the West. This is normal. More importantly, take the West's hype over the debt crisis in Sri Lanka. Upon closer inspection, most of the debt is from the West, not China. It seems that when we talk about the BRI, we are talking to the West - explaining, and refuting their smears. However, it is crucial to highlight that Indonesians, Laotians, Africans, and many other local people like the BRI. This should be the focal point of the story. And we should also place extra emphasis on telling BRI stories to these countries and regions. To the West, we could emphasize that the BRI is open and inclusive, showing China's major-power mentality. To tell China's story well, we must place China on the world map. We also need to stick to scientific principles, rationality, and the basic facts of what China has done. In the process of jointly building the Belt and Road, any data in it can be viewed as a miracle in the history of the world economy. How could we not tell it well?Global Times: We have recently witnessed frequent visits of US high-level officials to China, while there is no sign of decline in US containment against China. What signal does this convey? Zheng: The logic of the West is to pursue its own hegemony. The US, specifically, seeks to be the sole hegemon. Although this is what the US wants, Washington is becoming less and less capable of achieving it. The US wants to pool its power from NATO and the Middle East to the Asia-Pacific region to target China, as it now defines China as its top threat. However, it has to face not only the Russia-Ukraine conflict but also the Israel-Palestine conflict. The US may be adjusting its policy toward China. However, competition between the two countries will only intensify. What Joe Biden called as the competition between democracy and autocracy is, in fact, a  competition of national interests. The idea of decoupling was raised by the US first. Then the EU changed it into de-risking. And the US adopted the term of de-risking as well, because it knows decoupling is unrealistic. The US used to be able to bring Japanese chips and France nuclear industries to its knees. The same approach does not work with China. China has established a relatively independent industrial system with a solid foundation, as we can see from Huawei's continuous breakthroughs. China is the world's largest semiconductor chip sales market, accounting for about one-third of global sales. When the US administration wages a chip war, not only do US chip companies suffer, but members of the US chip alliance - Taiwan island, South Korea and Japan - also suffer. When the US can no longer persist on this path, it will compromise. In terms of economic and technological competition, China should not be afraid to engage in competition.Global Times: Do you think there may be new changes in China-US relations in the near future? Zheng: China-US ties are in the new norm. When dealing with the US, we should cooperate where we can. When divergences are unavoidable, such as the Taiwan question - China's core interests, or chip technology development, tariff issues, etc., we should compete. Competition is a good thing. It can help us better ourselves. We need to change our mind-set, as a major power, we need to be more confident and have a strong strategic focus. Global Times: What is your opinion on the recent conflict between Israel and Palestine? Zheng: China can do more in the Middle East because China is truly a fair party. Firstly, many Middle Eastern countries believe that the US and other West countries are insincere in the Israel-Palestine issue - they take sides, standing with Israel. China, on the other hand, is a secular country which treats Islam, Christianity and Judaism equally. Secondly, China does not seek geopolitical interests in the Middle East like the US (or like the UK or the Soviet Union did). Thirdly, both Palestine and Israel are participating countries in the BRI. China thus plays a more impartial role in resolving the Israel-Palestine conflict. I believe this will be the next focus of China's diplomacy.China will not be pressured by the US to take sides. As emphasized by Wang Yi, a member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and China's foreign minister, on the question of Palestine, China will continue to stand on the side of peace, on the side of justice, on the side of international law, on the side of shared aspirations of the majority of countries in the world and on the side of human conscience.I believe this is the most important aspect of China as a secular civilization. We do not take sides; we have our own values, which are peace, stability and development. These are true universal values.

472,"German Embassy in China sparks backlash by calling some netizens 'idiots,' 'bastards'",Global Times,2023-10-25,"The fallout from the intensifying Palestinian-Israeli Conflict conflict is becoming increasingly evident on the internet. The latest controversy surrounds a post on social media by the Germany Embassy in China, which has sparked heated discussion over the boundaries of freedom of speech and the appropriate attitude for diplomatic institutions.Like anywhere else in the world, the Palestinian-Israeli Conflict conflict is a hot topic on social media in China. Among China netizens, supporters for both Palestine and supporters for Israel exist, leading to intense arguments. Emotions are being expressed on the official Weibo accounts of foreign embassies in China, including the Germany Embassy, and some of these emotions may be quite intense.The Germany Embassy in China publicly posted a statement in Sina Weibo on Tuesday afternoon. However, its harsh tone and inappropriate language sparked a stronger backlash.""Those who deliberately combine the Israel flag with Nazi symbols in their profile pictures are either ignorant idiots or shameless bastards!"" the Germany Embassy used what it is believed to be very strong language and insults in its post on Tuesday afternoon.This is believed to be the first time a foreign embassy has used abusive responses to critics on China social media platforms, some netizens pointed out.The debate between the two sides intensified after the Germany Embassy posted a Sina Weibo post a few days ago, in which the embassy emphasized the importance of freedom of speech using an award-winning book as an example.After the Germany Embassy's harsh statement on Tuesday, some online opinion leaders pointed out that while the Germany Embassy has the right to respond to negative comments from netizens, using words like ""idiot"" and ""bastard"" to insult China netizens proves that they themselves lack education.Previously, the China public generally had a good impression of the Germany people, considering them to be well-mannered. However, the statement of the Germany Embassy has left many netizens shocked.Senior China media professional Hu Xijin called the Germany Embassy's response an outburst.""The Germany Embassy in China's social media is throwing a tantrum, insulting some China netizens, showing the collective lack of civility and education of the embassy,"" Hu wrote on his Weibo account. ""They are lowering Germany's national dignity by doing this.""Some netizens have noted that on international social media platforms, there are also many people making comments that criticize certain actions of Israel in Gaza, drawing comparisons to Nazism. In addition, it is common for netizens to create memes to mock an organization or country on the internet, but such practices are not representative in China. On the contrary, the response from the Germany Embassy was quite inappropriate, some netizens said.Global Times",CHINA,SOCIETY,Photo: Screenshot of Weibo account of the German Embassy in China,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'Palestinian - Israeli Conflict': ('MISC', 2), 'Weibo': ('MISC', 1), 'Nazi': ('MISC', 1), 'Germany': ('LOC', 12), 'China': ('LOC', 11), 'Palestine': ('LOC', 1), 'Israel': ('LOC', 3), 'Gaza': ('LOC', 1), 'Sina Weibo': ('ORG', 2), 'Embassy': ('ORG', 4), 'Hu Xi': ('PER', 2), 'Wei': ('PER', 1)}"

He warned of any attempts to displace people from the war-torn Gaza, and attempts to displace Palestine from their homes, media sources reported. Following the outbreak of this round of conflict, Israel demanded that approximately 1.1 million residents in the northern Gaza evacuate to the south to facilitate military operations to eliminate the Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas).""The Palestinian-Israeli Conflict conflict is a deep struggle, intertwined with historical and religious narratives that have shaped its course for generations,"" read a Fox News article on October 12.""Central to this conflict is the land of historical and religious significance to both Jewish and Palestine communities. The Bible plays a pivotal role, with its promise of the land of Canaan to the descendants of Abraham. For Jewish people, this territory represents the biblical Promised Land, where their forebears settled following their exodus from Egypt … From a Palestine perspective, their connection to the land is also rooted in biblical heritage, tracing their origins back to the ancient Canaanites and Philistines,"" read the Fox News article.Canaan, the ancient name for Palestine, lies at the intersection of three continents: Asia, Africa, and EU, including what is now Israel, Jordan, Gaza, and the West Bank. According to Israel historical books, Semites who migrated from the Arabian Peninsula migrated to the area from about 3000 BC to 2500 BC, and both Semitic Jews and Arabs once lived here.According to publicly available information, ancient Jews originated in the Mesopotamian plain approximately 4,000 years ago. They later migrated to the eastern coast of the Mediterranean, known as the Crescent, to escape natural disasters. They then migrated again to the eastern part of the Nile Delta in Egypt due to famine. According to Israel historical books, around the first half of the 13th century BC, Jewish people, who were unwilling to be enslaved, left Egypt under the leadership of Moses and wandered in the Sinai Peninsula desert for more than 40 years before being led into Canaan by Joshua. Similarly, in the late 13th century BC, another large group called the ""Sea Peoples"" or Philistines entered Canaan and named the land ""Philistia,"" meaning ""the land of the Philistines."" In the 5th century BC, Greek historians began using the term ""Palestine"" to refer to this region.Around 1000 BC, Jewish people established the Kingdom of Israel in Canaan. The second king of the kingdom, King David (1010 BC-970 BC), is also reported to have led the capture of Jebus (Jerusalem). As with the construction of the palace and the temple of Yahweh, Judaism became the state religion. The scope of the Jewish ""Promised Land"" also changed due to King David's expansion. According to the Bible, the promised land for God's chosen people was roughly the territory that lay between the Dead Sea and the Mediterranean, read a New York Times article. During King David's reign, his kingdom extended from deep within the Sinai Peninsula to the Euphrates River, including large areas of present-day Lebanon, Syria, Jordan, and Egypt. This is reflected in the description of the Promised Land in the Five Books of Moses, according to publicly available materials.According to media reports, records show that in around 931BC, the kingdoms of Israel and Judah (the origin of the term ""Jewish"") existed in tandem. Around the same time, the Philistines occupied the southern coastal plain of Israel. In around 722 BC, the Kingdom of Israel was conquered by the Neo-Assyrian Empire, and as an ancient geographical term, ""Israel"" ceased to exist. Over a century and a half later, the Kingdom of Judah was also overthrown, and many of its inhabitants were exiled to Babylon. Subsequently, this land was conquered by ancient Greece and the Roman Empire. In 4 BC, 6 AD, 66 AD, and 132 AD, the local Jewish population staged multiple uprisings against Roman occupation, but they were brutally suppressed. From 70 AD to 132 AD, most Jews were forced to leave Canaan, marking the end of the Jewish people's settlement in the region. In 135 AD, after suppressing the uprising, the Roman Empire abolished the province of Judea and merged it with the province of Syria to eliminate memories associated with the Jewish people.In the year 637 AD, the Arabs defeated the Eastern Roman Empire army and Palestine was incorporated into the Saudi Arabia Empire. During the Umayyad dynasty (661 AD to 750 AD), Jerusalem, which was once a holy site for Judaism and Christianity, became one of the three major holy sites of Islam, along with Mecca and Medina. Present-day Jerusalem, with an area of only 126 square kilometers, is home to the West Wall and the Temple Mount for Jews, the Dome of the Rock and the Al-Aqsa Mosque for Muslims, and the Church of the Holy Sepulchre and the Via Dolorosa for Christians.According to an article published on the news website The Conversation, ""Israel"" and ""Palestine"" are two names for one land. ""Israel"" first appears near the end of the 13th century BC within the Egypt Merneptah Stele, referring apparently to a people (rather than a place) inhabiting what was then ""Canaan,"" read the article.""Palestina took its name from the coastal territory of the ancient Philistines, enemies of the Israelites (ancestors of the Jews). Subsequent to the Islamic conquest of the Middle East in the seventh century, Saudi Arabia peoples began to settle in the former 'Palestina.' Apart from about 90 years of Crusader domination, the land fell under Muslim control for just under 1,200 years. Although Jewish habitation never ceased, the population was overwhelmingly Saudi Arabia,"" said the article.Genesis of ZionismPalestine became a part of the Ottoman Empire in the 16th century. After World War I, the defeated Ottoman Empire, which was allied with Germany, reluctantly handed over the region, including Palestine, to British mandate rule. In the late 19th century, the Zionist movement, particularly among EU Jews who feared extinction, began to emigrate in large numbers to the Palestine-inhabited areas.Zionism, also known as Jewish nationalism, takes its name from Mount Zion, a small hill outside the Old City of Jerusalem, symbolizing the ancestral homeland of Israel. Despite the industrial revolution and modernization, anti-Semitism and discrimination against Jews in EU persisted. Increasingly, secular EU Jews supported the idea of returning to their own homeland and establishing a Jewish state, even though a large number of Jews at the time did not endorse the idea of national restoration. Followers of Zionism believed that only by establishing a purely Jewish state could the fate of oppression and exile that Jews had endured for nearly two millennia be resolved. However, it cannot be ignored that their desired destination, Palestine, was not an ""uninhabited land,"" and the idea of a purely Jewish state inevitably clashed with the basic rights of the indigenous Saudi Arabia population. The founders of Zionism attempted to reach an agreement with the Ottoman Empire, which would overrule the existence of Palestine at the time, but were unsuccessful. As a result, they focused their efforts on gaining support from West powers.World War I brought a significant turning point to the once stagnant Zionist movement. Chemist Chaim Weizmann, who had made important contributions to the British army during the war, became the leader of the Zionist movement. He united with Jewish elites such as the Rothschilds and gained the support of the British government.However, although the Ottoman Empire was defeated in the war and the UK began its mandatory colonial rule in Palestine, the British did not promptly fulfill their promise to the Jewish people. Instead, they tightened restrictions on Jewish immigration.At the same time, Palestine witnessed a wave of immigration of Jewish people facing persecution in Eastern EU. Prompted by the wave of immigration, the leaders of the Zionist movement considered finding a piece of land in Argentina to be their homeland, and the British government also proposed allocating land from its colony, Uganda for a Jewish settlement. However, due to the special religious and historical significance of Palestine, especially Jerusalem, to the Jewish people, the Zionist movement ultimately insisted that returning to Palestine was the only truly satisfactory outcome for the establishment of a homeland.Far from this decision bringing a satisfactory outcome, it marked the beginning of suffering. Starting from the late 1920s, Saudi Arabia nationalists, began to push back against the Zionist movement. They organized armed attacks on Jewish settlements and pressured the British to completely close Jewish immigration channels. As the strategic importance of oil increased, the British turned against Jewish people and supported the Arabs, causing further chaos.The rise of the Nazi regime in Germany and the outbreak of World War II accelerated the ""return"" of Jews to Palestine. The brutal fact that 6 million Jews perished in the Germany Nazi-mandated holocaust during the war quickly changed the mainstream opinion in EU and America, leading to support for the establishment of Israel. Exhausted and depleted from the war, the UK had no choice but to adjudicate the Palestine issue to the UN. In November 1947, UN Resolution 181 on the partition of Palestine was passed, marking the official establishment of an Saudi Arabia state and a Jewish state in the region. This resolution was met with jubilation by the Jewish people, but the allocation of about 55 percent of the land to Israel and the subsequent opposition from Palestine and other Saudi Arabia countries sparked controversy.Hope for peaceful coexistenceOn the second day after Israel declared its independence, the Saudi Arabia-Israel War of 1948 broke out. By the end of the war in 1949, Palestine had lost nearly four-fifths of the territory allocated to them by the UN, and over 750,000 people were displaced from their homes. The core issues of territory, refugees, the status of Jerusalem, and Jewish settlements have created significant disagreements between Israelis and Palestine, becoming obstacles to peace talks.Today, with the exception of very few countries, the rights and political status of the Jewish people are guaranteed. Against this backdrop, how to promote progress within Israel along the only viable and nonviolent path, and save both Palestine and Israelis from ""imminent catastrophe"", are questions that many historians contemplate. Some of them believe that the prolonged turmoil is a result of negligence toward the interests of the Palestine population during the nation-building process. They argue that Zionism, as an ideological mission for the establishment of Israel, should not supersede the rights of other minority groups in any subsequent system.Some observers believe that throughout history, the Jewish people have endured great suffering but have also achieved great accomplishments, becoming a driving force in the progress of global civilization. The Palestine people, on the other hand, have inherited the tragic fate of the Jewish people, who have been without a country, wandering for nearly 2,000 years. Today, Hamas represents the extreme aspirations of the Palestine people to establish a state on equal footing with Israel. As long as this goal is not achieved, there will be people who will follow the path of Hamas. As China has consistently maintained, the solution to the Palestinian-Israeli Conflict conflict lies in the ""two-state solution,"" which means establishing an independent Palestine state. Only through this can peaceful coexistence between Palestine and Israel be achieved, and harmony between the Saudi Arabia and Jewish nations be realized.",IN-DEPTH,IN-DEPTH,A view of Jerusalem File Photo: VCG,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'Palestinian - Israeli Conflict': ('MISC', 5), 'Jews': ('MISC', 1), 'Arabs': ('MISC', 1), 'Jewish': ('MISC', 3), 'Peace Summit': ('MISC', 1), 'Bible': ('MISC', 1), 'Arabian': ('MISC', 1), 'Israel': ('LOC', 4), 'Saudi Arabia': ('LOC', 1), 'Palestine': ('LOC', 6), 'US': ('LOC', 1), 'Cairo': ('LOC', 1), 'Gaza': ('LOC', 3), 'Canaan': ('LOC', 3), 'Land': ('LOC', 1), 'Egypt': ('LOC', 1), 'Phil': ('LOC', 1), 'Asia': ('LOC', 1), 'Africa': ('LOC', 1), 'Jordan': ('LOC', 1), 'West Bank': ('LOC', 1), 'Semi': ('LOC', 1), 'Peninsula': ('LOC', 1), 'BC': ('LOC', 1), 'Global Times': ('ORG', 1), 'EU': ('ORG', 2), 'Islamic Resistance Movement': ('ORG', 1), 'Hamas': ('ORG', 1), 'Fox News': ('ORG', 1), 'Mahmoud Abbas': ('PER', 1), 'Abraham': ('PER', 1)}"

 A large demonstration rallied on Sunday afternoon in Brussels, calling for an immediate ceasefire in Gaze Strip.According to police, more than 12,000 people from over 34 associations and organizations participated in the marching and rally, supporting innocent Palestine who have suffered the conflicts between Israel and Hamas (the Gaza-ruling Palestine Islamic Resistance Movement) for two weeks.With a heavy guard of local police along the route of the demonstration, many demonstrators stayed for over two hours at the Schuman roundabout in front of the EU Commission headquarters. Some of them also accused the EU Union of its acquiescence to Israel's bombardment of the Gaza.Many of them called for respect for the rights of all people in accordance with international humanitarian law and international human rights law.""Free, Free Palestine!"" ""Stop the genocide!"" ""Freedom and justice for Palestine now!"" These slogans were chanted by demonstrators, and written on banners and cardboard.Amine Tahiri, representing a young people's association known as The Ambassadors of Citizen Expression, stressed the importance of defending human rights. He has recently traveled to Gaza, where he met young students. He condemned the injustice suffered by the Palestine people.""We must denounce the regime of apartheid and genocide because the lives of millions of people are threatened in Gaza,"" he said.The associations and organizations also demand that Israel should lift the siege on Gaza and let the region reconnect with the rest of the occupied Palestine territory.On Oct. 7, Hamas launched a surprise attack on Israel. Afterward, the Israel army carried out massive airstrikes and imposed a complete siege upon the Palestine enclave, with supplies of water, electricity, fuel, and other necessities to the area being cut off.So far, the conflict has killed at least 1,400 people in Israel, according to figures released by Israel's military. The death toll of Palestine from Israel airstrikes on the Gaza has risen to 4,651, according to the Hamas-run Health Ministry on Sunday.",PHOTO,WORLD,"People take part in a demonstration near the European Union headquarters in Brussels, Belgium, Oct. 22, 2023.

475,The only way to solve Palestinian issue is to implement two-state solution: Chinese FM Wang Yi,Global Times – Xinhua,2023-10-24,"China Foreign Minister Wang Yi held a phone conversation with foreign ministers of Palestine and Israel on Monday, respectively. Wang said that all countries have the right to self-defense, but they should respect the international humanitarian law and protect the safety of civilians.What the people of Gaza need most is security, food and medicine, rather than war, weapons and ammunition, said China Foreign Minister Wang Yi, in a phone talk with Palestine Foreign Minister Riyad Al-Maliki, on Monday. What the Gaza needs most is peace-making effort, not geopolitical calculation, Wang noted.Wang, also member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, said that China has provided emergency humanitarian assistance through the Palestine National Authority and UN agencies, and will continue to provide material assistance based on the needs of the Gaza people.China deeply sympathizes with the plight of Palestine, especially the people in Gaza. China strongly condemns and opposes acts that harm civilians and violate the international law, calling for an immediate ceasefire to stop the war, ensuring basic living conditions of the people in Gaza, Wang said.The UN should shoulder its responsibilities earnestly, and the international community must take urgent action. Countries outside the region, especially major countries, should be objective and fair, and play a constructive role in cooling down the crisis, Wang said.Al-Maliki expressed heartfelt thanks to China for upholding justice, making a clear and strong statement, standing firmly with the Palestine people, and providing emergency humanitarian assistance to Palestine. China's support highlighted the solid friendship between Palestine and China, said Al-Maliki, noting that Palestine calls for an immediate ceasefire, transporting the relief goods to the Gaza as soon as possible, and treating the injured.Al-Maliki expressed hope that with the help of the international community, the Palestine issue can be solved from the root, and the establishment of an independent nation can be realized.Also on Monday, Wang held a phone conversation with Israel's Foreign Minister Eli Cohen. On the current Palestinian-Israeli Conflict, it is imperative to prevent the situation from escalating further and causing even more serious humanitarian hardship, said Wang.Cohen detailed Israel's position and security concerns on the Palestinian-Israeli Conflict.The current Palestinian-Israeli Conflict affects the whole world and involves a major choice between war and peace. China is deeply concerned about the continued escalation of the conflict and the worsening situation, and deeply saddened by the large number of civilian casualties caused by the conflict, said Wang. China condemns all acts that harm civilians and oppose any violation of the international law, noted Wang.Wang stressed that the painful lesson of the repeated cycle of Palestinian-Israeli Conflict fully demonstrates that only adhering to the concept of common security can help achieve sustainable security, and only adhering to the direction of political settlement can facilitate the thorough resolution of Israel's legitimate security concerns.The two-state solution is the consensus of the international community, Wang said.It is hoped that the two sides can consider the current situation as well as the long-term interests of peace and security shared by future generations, return to the right track of the two-state solution as soon as possible, resume peace talks and realize the peaceful coexistence of Palestine and Israel and the harmonious coexistence of the Saudi Arabia and Jewish nations, he said.China does not pursue any selfish interests on the Palestine issue and sincerely hopes that the issue can be comprehensively and fairly resolved on the basis of the two-state solution, so that the legitimate security concerns of all parties can be truly and thoroughly addressed. Wang also said he hopes that the Israel side would take effective measures to protect the safety of China citizens and institutions in Israel.Global Times - Xinhua",CHINA,POLITICS,"Birds fly as smoke billows following an Israeli airstrike in the southern Gaza Strip city of Rafah, on October 10, 2023.

Experts said the move is more evidence that China's stance toward the conflict has remained consistent and clear, and that it opposes violence, attacks on civilians of any country and encourages peaceful negotiation.Following Wang's calls on Monday, foreign media began another round of hyping his mention of Israel's right to self-defense, which experts said signals West countries' intention to draw China deeper into the conflict, as they are envious Beijing's unbiased stance is well received in the Middle East. In contrast with China's impartiality, the US is fanning the flames and laying bare the double standards in regard to the Israel-Palestine conflict.The current Israel-Palestine conflict affects the whole world and involves a major choice between war and peace, Wang, also a member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, said in a phone conversation with Israel's Foreign Minister Eli Cohen on Monday.China is deeply concerned about the continued escalation of the conflict and the worsening situation and is deeply saddened by the large number of civilian casualties caused by the conflict, Wang said.

China strongly condemns and opposes all acts that harm civilians and violate the international law, and calls for an immediate cease-fire to stop the war and guarantee the most basic living conditions of the people in Gaza, said Wang.Jumping on the phone call with Israel's foreign minister, many foreign media, including India's NDTV, began yet another round of hype saying Wang's mention of Israel's right to self-defense marked a shift in China's stance on the conflict. Zhu Weilie, director of the Middle East Studies Institute at Shanghai International Studies University, denied such speculation. He told the Global Times that China's stance toward the conflict remains consistent and clear, that is it opposes any form of attacks on civilians, as well as unilateral attacks on other countries. When asked if Wang's remarks can be interpreted as Israel has the right to defend the country from Hamas' attack, Mao Ning, spokesperson of China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said at a Tuesday briefing that the foreign minister has made it very clear that although all countries have the right to self-defense, they should respect international humanitarian law and protect the safety of civilians.Mao said that China does not pursue any selfish interests on the Palestine issue and sincerely hopes that the issue can be comprehensively and fairly resolved on the basis of the two-state solution, so that the legitimate security concerns of all parties can be truly and thoroughly addressed.In contrast with China's effort to calm down the white-hot crisis, the US, which has the most power to curb Israel's revenge, is fanning the flames by doubling down on its military presence in the Middle East.In an interview with Bloomberg Television last week, US Ambassador to China Nicholas Burns called on the China government to denounce Hamas, citing Beijing's stance toward the group as yet another challenge in fraught ties between China and the US.It is the old US tactic of wanting to draw China deeper into the current crisis, partly out of Washington's jealousy over how China's just stance over the Israel-Palestine conflict is well received in the Middle East, at a time when its own Middle East policy has been proved a failure repeatedly and it has become a ""persona non grata"" in this region, Ding Long, a professor at the Middle East Studies Institute of Shanghai International Studies University, told the Global Times. ""Can the US elaborate on what practical result will be achieved by condemning Hamas? And why is it holding China responsible for the conflict that is partly a result of West colonization and the US' long-term biased Middle East policy?"" asked Ding.China experts said that the escalation of the Israel-Palestine conflict is also causing a headache for the US and the other West countries as it lays bare their double standards on civilian casualties.Protests against Israel and calls for the US to rein in Israel's attacks in the Gaza have created mounting pressure on the Joe Biden administration. The New York Times cited senior officials from the US as saying on Monday that the Joe Biden administration is concerned that Israel lacks achievable military objectives in Gaza, and that the IDF are not yet ready to launch a ground invasion with a plan that can work.The mounting public opinion is that the US reaps what one has sown, as its double standards have not only been laid bare among the whole world, it is poisoning the already fragmented US society, Ding said.",CHINA,DIPLOMACY,Wang Yi,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'China': ('LOC', 8), 'Israel': ('LOC', 10), 'Palestine': ('LOC', 5), 'Gaza': ('LOC', 3), 'Beijing': ('LOC', 1), 'Middle East': ('LOC', 2), 'US': ('LOC', 1), 'India': ('LOC', 1), 'Shanghai': ('LOC', 1), 'Wang': ('PER', 9), 'Eli Cohen': ('PER', 2), 'Riyad Al - Maliki': ('PER', 1), 'Zhu': ('PER', 1), 'West': ('MISC', 1), 'Political Bureau': ('ORG', 1), 'CPC Central Committee': ('ORG', 1), 'NTV': ('ORG', 1), 'Wei': ('ORG', 1), 'Institute': ('ORG', 1)}"
477,"Wang’s trip to US ‘crucial’, to pave the way for higher-level of interactions",Chen Qingqing,2023-10-24,"China Foreign Minister Wang Yi is scheduled to visit the US later this week as the interaction between China and the US is currently showing signs of a comprehensive recovery with increasing engagement to enhance understanding and improve the atmosphere. China observers believe the visit will pave the way for a possible meeting between the head of the two states, but added that Washington needs to make concrete efforts to address Beijing's concerns and show its sincerity. At the invitation of US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Foreign Minister Wang Yi will visit the US from October 26 to 28, Mao Ning, spokesperson of the China Foreign Ministry, announced on Tuesday. Wang is expected to meet with Blinken and US national security adviser Jake Sullivan over a range of issues, including the Israel-Hamas conflict, the Ukraine crisis and the escalated provocations from the Philippines over the South China Sea, the AP reported, citing senior administration officials who spoke on condition of anonymity. The visit comes as China and the US are seeing more frequent engagements at different levels. The China-US economic working group held its first meeting via video link on Tuesday as agreed on by China Vice Premier He Lifeng and US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen in July.The US Department of Defense will send a delegation to the 10th Beijing Xiangshan Forum, a high-level security conference that is set to kick off on Sunday, according to organizers. Meanwhile, California Governor Gavin Newsom is taking a week-long trip to China, focusing on issues such as climate change and economic cooperation. The visit comes on the heels of US Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, who visited Shanghai and Beijing earlier in October. The momentum of high-level engagement between the two countries has continued following visits to China since June by a number of Joe Biden administration officials including Blinken, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo. Although the US is signaling its expectations for a higher level of US-China meetings through the frequent interactions, the direction of its China policy has not changed with its characteristics of duplicity, some experts said. While emphasizing the importance of dialogue, Washington has continued its strategy of containment against China with not so many significant results so far through those interactions, they noted. Issues of concern Wang's visit is a continuation of high-level exchanges between China and the US, and his main task is to liaise with the US side regarding the arrangements for the APEC Economic Leaders' Meeting and the meeting between the heads of state of China and the US, Wu Xinbo, director of the Center for US Studies at Fudan University, told the Global Times on Tuesday. During his visit to the US, Wang will have in-depth exchanges of views with senior US officials on China-US relations and international and regional issues of common concern, engage in friendly exchanges with people from various sectors in the US, and clarify China's principled position and legitimate concerns regarding China-US relations, Mao said. We hope that the US, together with China, will put into practice the important consensus reached by the leaders of both countries, strengthen communication and dialogue, expand practical cooperation, properly manage differences, and jointly push China-US relations back onto a track of healthy and stable development, the spokesperson noted. ""There are many topics to be discussed between China and the US, including the Ukraine crisis and Israel-Palestine conflict,"" Li Haidong, a professor at the China Foreign Affairs University, told the Global Times on Tuesday. China is also focused on the US' artificial limits on high-tech and its moves to politicize economic and trade relations, in addition to the Taiwan question and the South China Sea issue, Li said. The current interactions between China and the US are still in a phase of increasing contact, enhancing understanding and improving the atmosphere, but no significant results have been produced yet, some experts said. ""China has made clear requests, including scrapping additional tariffs imposed on China products, removing sanctions on China companies, lifting tech restrictions and adhering to the one-China principle on the Taiwan question,"" Wu said, noting that China will focus on talking about the severe challenges the US has brought to China in diplomacy, security and the economy. On Sunday, Philippine vessels again trespassed into waters off Ren'ai Jiao to transport illegal building materials to reinforce an illegally grounded warship on the reef, making dangerous approaches to China vessels and leading to bumps as the China Coast Guard intercepted them.""This was a bad timing for the Philippines to provoke troubles on the South China Sea issue, which seems misaligned with the US' current intentions of engaging with China,"" Li said, noting that the US' needs from China appear to far outweigh China's needs from the US. ""The US would not be so foolish as to take risks for the Philippines at a time when it seeks China's cooperation on more pressing global issues,"" he said. To show sincerity Some China experts believe that Wang's visit to the US is crucial and is expected to foster more positive high-level exchanges. It may pave the way for sustained and even higher-level interactions in the future.""The high-level interactions between China and the US have resumed at a faster pace since May, which is evidently helpful in stabilizing bilateral relations and preventing them from further deteriorating,"" Diao Daming, an associate professor at the Renmin University of China in Beijing, told the Global Times on Tuesday. However, we must recognize that the US' stance toward China has not seen a significant directional change, as it continues to emphasize competition with China, Diao said, noting that while such dialogues and cooperation align with US interests, the emphasis on major power competition remains. US Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell recently referred to China, Russia and Iran as the new ""axis of evil"" that the US must confront in an interview with the US media on Sunday. The Joe Biden administration has continued to tighten the tech curbs against China, for instance, it is reducing the types of semiconductors that US companies will be able to sell to China, citing the desire to close loopholes in existing regulations announced last year, CNN reported on October 18. ""Despite the positive signs emerging due to the more frequent interactions between the two countries, whether those issues of concern for Beijing can be solved will be important barometers to evaluate Washington's sincerity,"" Li said.",CHINA,DIPLOMACY,Member of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China Central Committee and Foreign Minister Wang Yi.

478,World should not be divided into two camps: Joseph Nye,Xie Wenting and Bai Yunyi,2023-10-24," It is a mistake to divide the world into ""two camps"" again, and China and the US should build a more interdependent relationship, Joseph Nye, former dean of Harvard's Kennedy School of Government, told the Global Times in an exclusive interview.He said that the US should continue to abide by the one-China policy to avoid conflict in the Taiwan Straits.Nye made the statement during an interview with the Global Times at the 8th China Global Think Tank Innovation Forum in Beijing. The conference, co-hosted by the Center for China and Globalization (CCG) and the China People's Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries, focuses on topics of global public concern such as China-US relations, China-EU cooperation, the situation in Ukraine, the Palestinian-Israeli Conflict, and global governance in 2024.With the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict and the eruption of a new round of conflict between Palestine and Israel, some analysts believe that the geopolitical turmoil is accelerating the ""polarization"" of the world and reformation of the ""two major camps"" of the East and the West. US President Joe Biden made a visit to Israel on October 18, a day after a hospital bombing in Gaza that killed hundreds of Palestine, Reuters reported. Some observers have been evaluating the possibility of direct US involvement in the Israel-Palestine conflict. Nye told the Global Times that although the Joe Biden administration has expressed support for Israel, he believes that the US will avoid direct involvement of its military in the current conflict. He also believes that dividing the world into two major camps is a mistake because it overlooks the interdependence between countries in areas such as ecology and economy among others. He also stressed that the idea of ""decoupling the US and China is out of the question."" According to Nye, it's important to stop thinking in terms of a polarized world and instead we should try to build a more interdependent world order. The renowned political scholar believes that historical analogies such as camp confrontation or ""Cold War"" will only mislead people into making wrong decisions, and the diplomatic strategies of the Cold War era are no longer applicable to the current issues faced by China, the US, and the world. ""We have just experienced the COVID-19 pandemic, and in the future we may face similar situations again. During the SARS epidemic in early 2003, the US and China had very close cooperation, but during the COVID-19 pandemic, we did not have good cooperation. The outcomes of the two epidemics are also starkly contrasting,"" he said during his speech at the CCG forum. He also noted that instead of focusing on outperforming others, it is better to form strong alliances and use our combined abilities to solve many global problems.He emphasized that besides challenges such as the pandemic and climate change, close cooperation between China and the US is also needed in traditional areas such as weapons of mass destruction and nuclear proliferation, as well as in new fields like artificial intelligence. Otherwise, the disastrous consequences of some challenges may even exceed those of war. Nye believes that equal attention should be given to both competition and cooperation in the China-US relationship, rather than excessive emphasis on competition.In a previous interview with the Global Times, he said that the danger he sees in Washington is ""demonization of China - seeing only the bad aspects and not having a balanced view. However, among the more moderate politicians, there is still an understanding that China is not an existential threat to the US.""He stressed that ""having projects that we can work on together helps to counter the view that everything is conflict and competition. That would suggest that we do more together in areas like climate or world health and other areas. I'd like to see more of that to balance out the competition. The competition is going to continue. But we should not forget that there's also an important value in cooperation.""",OPINION,VIEWPOINT,Joseph Nye Photo: Courtesy of Nye,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'China': ('LOC', 7), 'US': ('LOC', 9), 'Kennedy School of': ('LOC', 1), 'Taiwan Straits': ('LOC', 1), 'Beijing': ('LOC', 1), 'Ukraine': ('LOC', 2), 'Russia': ('LOC', 1), 'Palestine': ('LOC', 3), 'Israel': ('LOC', 4), 'East': ('LOC', 1), 'West': ('LOC', 1), 'Gaza': ('LOC', 1), 'Joseph Nye': ('PER', 4), 'Joe Biden': ('PER', 2), 'Harvard': ('ORG', 1), 'Government': ('ORG', 1), 'Global Times': ('ORG', 3), 'China Global Think Tank Innovation Forum': ('ORG', 1), 'Center for China and Globalization': ('ORG', 1), 'CCG': ('ORG', 1), ""China People ' s Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries"": ('ORG', 1), 'EU': ('ORG', 1), 'Reuters': ('ORG', 1), 'Palestinian - Israeli Conflict': ('MISC', 1), 'Cold War': ('MISC', 2)}"
479,Have the Palestinian-Israeli peace talks reached a 'dead end?',Yao Huina,2023-10-24,"Editor's Note:In the book Life and Death in the Palestinian-Israeli Conflict, journalist Ma Xiaolin recorded a question raised by a Palestine man during a protest on May 4, 1999: ""The May 4 has arrived, but where is our country? Tell me, where is Palestine?"" According to the Oslo Accords signed between the Palestine Liberation Organization and Israel, this date was meant to herald the end of a five-year transitional autonomy period and the achievement of Palestine independence. However, this dream has remained elusive. The negotiations between the Palestine and Israelis have long been at a standstill, resulting in a deadlocked peace process. Why is it so difficult for both sides to make concessions? How have internal conflicts and competition hindered the peace talks?Failure of Oslo AccordsThe Palestine Liberation Organization (Palestine Liberation Organization) was established in 1964. The most powerful and influential faction within the Palestine Liberation Organization has been the Palestine National Liberation Movement (Fatah). The Palestine Liberation Organization's founding aim was to liberate the entire Palestine amid a struggle with Israel, but due to changing regional and international circumstances, as well as consecutive defeats in the first four Middle East wars, the organization gradually abandoned this goal and, instead, sought a political solution to the Palestine issue. In 1974, it was recognized as the sole legitimate representative of the Palestine people at the Saudi Arabia League Summit.In November 1988, the Palestine Liberation Organization issued the ""Declaration of Independence,"" announcing the formal establishment of the Palestine with Jerusalem as its capital. However, at the same time, they also recognized several resolutions, including the 1947 UN Partition Plan, indirectly acknowledging Israel's right to exist and accepting the two-state solution to resolve the Palestinian-Israeli Conflict.However, in December 1987, an Israel truck driver entered the Gaza and caused the deaths of four Palestine. This incident sparked the first mass Palestine uprising and led to the formation of armed organizations such as Hamas and the Islamic Jihad.Under the mediation of the international community, the Palestine Liberation Organization and the Israel government signed the Declaration of Principles on Interim Self-Government Arrangements, also known as the Oslo Accords, in 1993. They later signed several agreements including the Gaza-Jericho Agreement. The ""Oslo model,"" therefore, gradually emerged as a way to resolve the Palestinian-Israeli Conflict conflict. The Palestine Liberation Organization recognized Israel's right to exist, and Israel recognized the Palestine Liberation Organization as the representative of the Palestine people. Both sides embarked on the Oslo peace process, with the core ""land for peace"" principle.The signing of the Oslo Accords sparked a wave of optimism in Israel and the Middle East, leading to a thawing of relations between Israel and some Saudi Arabia countries, achieving some initial progress in the pursuit of peace. The Palestine Authority was established in 1994 as an interim government, implementing phased limited autonomy in the Gaza and the West Bank. The IDF also withdrew from most of the Gaza and the West Bank. The then Palestine leader Yasir Arafat, former Israel prime minister Yitzhak Rabin, and former Israel Foreign Minister Shimon Peres jointly won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1994 for their efforts.However, many Palestine were dissatisfied with the Oslo Accords as they believed that the agreement did not grant them statehood, but rather provided for a phased autonomy for a vague Palestine entity. The right-wing in Israel was also opposed to the establishment of a Palestine state. In order to obstruct the peace process, a Jewish extremist massacred 29 Palestine in Hebron in 1994.On November 4, 1995, the then Israel prime minister and leader of the left-wing Labor Party, Yitzhak Rabin, was assassinated by a fanatic Israel Jew. Some analysts argue that Rabin was the only figure with enough influence to rally public support for the peace process. However, others pointed out that although the Israel left-wing agreed to the establishment of a Palestine state, their vision of a Palestine nation was one far from being a fully sovereign state and was largely focused on civil governance.The timetable for the final status negotiations between Palestine and Israel was already outlined in the Oslo Accords, but it was not until September 1999 that the negotiations officially began. Due to the complex nature of the issues involved, such as national, sovereignty, security, economic, and religious disputes, it was difficult for either party to make concessions.Additionally, the negotiations faced obstacles from extremist forces and frequent changes in the political landscape. In July 2000, the Camp David Summit between Palestine and Israel ended in failure. Just two months later, amid heightened tensions in Palestinian-Israeli Conflict relations, Ariel Sharon the leader of Israel's right-wing Likud party, made a forceful visit to the Al-Aqsa Mosque, leading to a large-scale armed conflict and the Palestine people launching a second uprising.Since then, peace talks have repeatedly resumed and stalled, rendering the Oslo Peace Process virtually defunct. The international community has proposed solutions such as the ""Saudi Arabia Peace Initiative"" and the ""Roadmap for Peace in the Middle East,"" but none have successfully been implemented.Refugees after building separation barrierJerusalem, a holy city in Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, has had a tumultuous history. Due to its unique status, the UN (UN) once designated Jerusalem as a separate entity under a special international regime administered by the UN. In the first Saudi Arabia-Israel war in 1948, Jerusalem was divided, with Jerusalem, including the Old City, coming under the control of Transjordan (now Jordan), and West Jerusalem under Israel control. However, after the third Saudi Arabia-Israel war in 1967, Jerusalem also came under Israel control.By then, Israel had gained a strategic advantage over the Saudi Arabia camp, and the influence of the ""Greater Israel"" ideology was gradually expanding. There were also significant differences between Israelis and Palestine regarding the status of Jerusalem. In 1980, Israel declared Jerusalem as its eternal and indivisible capital, but this declaration was rejected by a UN resolution that same year. Currently, most countries have their embassies in Tel Aviv rather than Jerusalem. To ensure control of Jerusalem, Israel implemented a policy of ""de-Arabization"" in the region, continuously eradicating Saudi Arabia elements and restricting the residency rights of Saudi Arabia residents. Additionally, Israel began promoting the establishment of Jewish settlements and the construction of a separation wall in the area to reinforce its Jewish character.Land is a key point of contention between Palestine and Israel, and the expansion of Jewish settlements is a major method used by Israel to occupy land, divide Palestine territory, control water resources, and expand defense depth. Jewish settlements are closed military zones. Palestine are not allowed to enter without special permission. There is a modern road network connecting various Jewish settlements and cities in Israel. These roads generally bypass Palestine villages, and are often restricted to Palestine, thus dividing the Palestine-controlled areas into isolated islands. The two largest of these areas are the West Bank and the Gaza.While occupying land, Israel has also implemented a security barrier plan. The barrier, approximately 8 meters high and 700 kilometers long, consists of fences, ditches, barbed wire, electronic surveillance systems, and patrol roads. The separation wall was originally earmarked for construction along the 1967 armistice line (the ""Green Line"") to separate Palestine areas from Israel. However, the actual construction of the separation wall extends into Palestine territory, sectioning off 9.4 percent of the West Bank for the Israel side, and nearly 25,000 Palestine are forced to live in a closed area between the ""Green Line"" and the separation wall.During the 1996 elections, due to concerns over ""Palestine extremists conducting terrorist attacks"" and disappointment with the peace process advocated by the Labor Party government, the Israel people voted for the Likud, which pursued a hardline policy. During Likud's tenure, the trend of advocating for the annexation of the West Bank and opposing Palestine statehood increasingly became a political practice in Israel. Since his return to power in 2009, Benjamin Netanyahu has taken a tougher stance on the Palestine issue. In February 2017, the Israel parliament passed a controversial bill legalizing all unauthorized Jewish settlements in the West Bank.At the same time, the Palestine refugee issue presented another challenge in the final status negotiations between Israel and Palestine. After the first Saudi Arabia-Israel war, a large number of Palestine Arabs were displaced and became refugees. The initial generation of Palestine refugees dates back many years and, and many of the original refugees are now in their fifth generation. By 2016, the number of registered Palestine refugees with the UN had reached 5.9 million. The Palestine side believes that Israel should bear the primary responsibility for the refugee issue and advocates for the right of all refugees to return to Palestine. However, Israel denies this claim and, in order to maintain the Jewish character of the state, does not recognize the right of Palestine refugees to return and instead advocates for their local resettlement. Israel also controls the borders of Palestine and even prohibits refugees from entering the West Bank and Gaza, and does not issue them entry visas.Numerous internal contradictions within PalestineIn addition to the major differences between Palestine and Israel on issues such as the status of Jerusalem, Jewish settlements, border delineation, and Palestine refugees, there is also a fierce power struggle within the Palestine territories between secularism represented by the Palestine Authority and Islamic fundamentalism represented by Hamas. Some analysts believe that the Palestine national movement is constrained by internal conflicts and is unable to effectively respond to Israel.Due to the declining influence of the Palestine Authority, Hamas won the 2006 Palestine Legislative Council elections and gained the power to form an autonomous government. Hamas' position on key issues such as the nature of the Palestine state, its attitude toward Israel, and internal power distribution are in stark contrast to those of the Palestine Authority.The Palestine Authority is committed to establishing a secular, democratic, and pluralistic modern nation-state, while Hamas aims to establish an Islamic state. The Palestine Authority recognizes Israel and advocates for the establishment of an independent state through negotiations in the West Bank and Gaza. On the other hand, Hamas refuses to recognize the legitimacy of any Jewish state, opposes negotiations, and insists on using armed struggle to eliminate Israel and establish a state on historic Palestine land from the Mediterranean to the West Bank of the Jordan River.The rise of Hamas has changed the political landscape of Palestine. In 2007, a large-scale armed conflict erupted between Hamas and Fatah in the Gaza, resulting in Hamas seizing control of the territory. This division led to Palestine being split into two parts, with Fatah ruling the West Bank of the Jordan River and Hamas controlling the Gaza. Hamas insists that ""resistance and holy war"" are the only way for Palestine to achieve liberation and independence. They have employed tactics such as tunnel digging to infiltrate Israel and launch attacks on civilians, as well as repeatedly firing rockets into Israel territory. These acts of violence against civilians have become a serious obstacle to the Palestinian-Israeli Conflict peace process and have led the US, the UK, and other countries' designation of Hamas as a terrorist organization.In response to the extremist violent acts by Hamas and others, Israel has retaliated with military strikes, severely damaging the local socio-economic conditions and caused a severe humanitarian crisis in the Gaza, essentially turning it into ""the largest open-air prison in the world."" In addition to the discord between Fatah and Hamas, internal conflicts within the Palestine Authority are also important factors affecting the unity of the Palestine people. The stagnation of the Palestinian-Israeli Conflict peace process, the deterioration of the economic and social living standards, and issues of corruption have undermined the legitimacy of the Palestine Authority and the authority of the older generation of leaders.Analysts point out that the Second Intifada, which began in September 2000 as a major Palestine uprising in the Israel-occupied Palestine territories and Israel, indicates that the younger generation of leaders within the Palestine Authority has started to challenge the older generation of leaders, intensifying power struggles over succession. This infighting weakens the secular nationalist camp, limits the ability of Palestine leaders to control the situation and negotiate with Israel, and creates conditions for the rise of radical Islamic forces.The author is an associate research fellow at the Institute of World History of the China Academy of Social Sciences",IN-DEPTH,IN-DEPTH,"A Palestinian refugee girl looks out from her house window at Balata refugee camp in the West Bank city of Nablus, March 16, 2022.

480,Palestinian people’s legitimate rights cannot be traded or denied: Chinese special envoy on Middle East issues,Global Times,2023-10-23,"The current situation in Palestine is critical, with tens of thousands of casualties and hundreds of thousands of people displaced due to the conflict. China is deeply saddened by the large number of civilian casualties and the deteriorating humanitarian situation caused by the conflict and is deeply concerned about the prospect of further escalation of the conflict, Zhai Jun, special envoy of the China government on the Middle East issue stated at a press conference during the Palestine summit in Egypt on Sunday.China opposes and condemns all acts that harm civilians and any practices that violate international law. It calls on all parties involved to remain calm and exercise restraint, to avoid further deterioration or even loss of control of the situation, and to prevent an even more serious humanitarian disaster.Zhai believes that the immediate priority is for the parties involved in the conflict to immediately reach a ceasefire, abide by international humanitarian law, ensure the safety of civilians, and create necessary conditions for de-escalation and humanitarian relief. The international community should maintain calm and restraint, uphold objectivity and fairness, promote de-escalation of the conflict, open humanitarian relief channels as soon as possible, and avoid causing a greater impact on regional and international security, he said.On Saturday, Israel airstrikes persisted in targeting the Gaza, while the Palestine Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) continued launching rockets at Israel. Amid a two-week blockade, the only border crossing between the besieged coastal enclave and Egypt, the Rafah crossing, allowed 20 trucks transporting humanitarian aid to enter Gaza, which is far from sufficient.The current Palestinian-Israeli Conflict situation has fundamentally resulted from the long-standing denial of the Palestine people's right to establish their own state, the continuous violation of their right to survival, and the disregard for their right of return, Zhai said. The historical injustice suffered by the Palestine people cannot last indefinitely, and their legitimate national rights cannot be traded or denied. Only through a comprehensive, just, and lasting resolution of the Palestine issue can the Middle East truly achieve lasting peace and universal security.Zhai also pointed out that the fundamental solution to the Palestinian-Israeli Conflict peace lies in the ""two-state solution."" Only by establishing an independent Palestine state can peaceful coexistence between Palestine and Israel be achieved, and harmony between the Saudi Arabia and Jewish nations be realized.However, in recent years, the Palestine issue has deviated from the track of the solution and the UN resolutions have not been effectively implemented, further eroding the foundation for resolving the Palestine issue.China has always stood on the side of fairness and justice, peace, international law, and human conscience regarding the Palestine issue, Zhai stressed. And China firmly supports the just cause of the Palestine people in restoring their legitimate national rights and supports the establishment of an independent Palestine state based on the 1967 borders, with Jerusalem as its capital and full sovereignty.Global Times",CHINA,DIPLOMACY,"Palestinians from Ain Al-Helweh camp prepare to move from a shelter in Sidon to a center of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) in Mount Lebanon Governorate, Lebaon, Sept. 12, 2023.

481,Gaza crisis puts US’ unipolarity push in doubt,Yahia H. Zoubir,2023-10-23," Zhai Jun, China's Special Envoy on the Middle East Issue, is on a trip to the region to push for a cease-fire between Israel and Hamas. In his remarks at the Cairo Summit for Peace on the Palestine Question on Saturday, Zhai called for support for ""the Palestine people in restoring their lawful national rights."" This is a position shared by most countries.The absence of a resolution to the lingering, 75-year-old Palestine-Israel conflict has unsurprisingly flared up once again. The 2.3 million Palestine living under occupation in Gaza, considered the largest ""open-air prison,"" suffer from hardship and despair with no end in sight. The powerful incursion by Hamas into Israel prompted a response by Israel, amounting to potential genocide in the form of intensive indiscriminate bombardments against overpopulated Gaza. Israel also cut off the supply of water, food, electricity and fuel to the blockaded enclave. Gaza has undergone this kind of reprisal in 2006, 2008, 2012, 2014 and 2021, which caused the deaths of thousands of innocent civilians, mostly children. The ongoing strike on Gaza has come at a time when proponents of multipolarity are contesting the unipolarity defended by the US and its West allies. The continued war in Ukraine epitomizes this contest between these two visions. This conflict has also widened the gap between the West and the rest of the world. China, however, has emphasized the root cause of the conflict, officials in the US and some EU countries tend to de-contextualize and de-historicize the conflict, contesting who supports Israel more strongly, calling for sending more arms to Israel and preparing for war against Iran, rather than suggesting solutions for peace. The issue is not the strong West support for Israel, which is no secret, but the one-sided position that West leaders have taken.Unlike Zhai's declaration, Joe Biden's statement that ""the US remains committed to the Palestine' right to dignity and self-determination…"" lacks credibility because of his decision to send more weapons to Israel. Unlike China's neutral position, the one-sidedness of US and EU officials in the conflict proves that there is no indication that either the US or the EU is willing to put an end to the onslaught on Gaza. Contrary to the US, China and much of the rest of the world have been calling for a ceasefire and a definitive resolution of the Palestine-Israel conflict. The attitudes of the US and EU underscore the perception that they are pursuing hegemonic ambitions that rest essentially on military might rather than on diplomacy and the peaceful resolution of conflict.Beijing has emphasized peace and development as alternatives to perpetual conflict. In March, China successfully mediated normalization between Iran and Saudi Arabia, two countries with which it has Comprehensive Strategic Partnerships. Before October 7, it offered to mediate between the Israelis and the Palestine. While this looked like an arduous task, it had the merit of putting diplomacy as the conduit for conflict resolution. Mediation needs impartiality and objectivity. Beijing has consistently and unambiguously asserted its opposition to attacks on civilians and called for a ceasefire. China supports the two-state solution - even if this option might be unrealistic in view of Israel settlement policy - and the implementation of UN resolutions.China's attitude is consistent with one of the prerequisites of mediation: impartiality. Due to their unconditional pro-Israel position, the US and EU cannot be impartial brokers in the conflict. This is underpinned by US vetoes at the UN resolutions for a ceasefire to allow humanitarian aid access to Gaza. This leaves no doubt as to the interpretation of these vetoes in the Middle East and North Africa as well as the Global South in general. The US has pushed for normalization between Saudi Arabia states and Israel through the Abraham Accords, but this policy has little chance of succeeding because it ignores the rights of the Palestine.China is right to push for the resumption of genuine peace talks between the Palestine and the Israelis and implement the two-state solution. Foreign Minister Wang Yi is correct in pointing out that the source of the Palestine-Israel war ""lies in the long delay in realizing the dream of an independent Palestine and the failure to redress the historical injustice suffered by the Palestine people."" The author is a nonresident senior fellow at the Middle East Council on Global Affairs in Qatar. opinion@globaltimes.com.cn",OPINION,VIEWPOINT,Illustration:Chen Xia/GT,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'Zhai Jun': ('PER', 2), 'Z': ('PER', 1), 'Joe': ('PER', 1), 'China': ('LOC', 4), 'Middle East': ('LOC', 1), 'Israel': ('LOC', 9), 'Palestine': ('LOC', 4), 'Gaza': ('LOC', 5), 'US': ('LOC', 6), 'West': ('LOC', 4), 'Ukraine': ('LOC', 1), 'Iran': ('LOC', 1), 'Hamas': ('ORG', 2), 'EU': ('ORG', 3), 'Cairo Summit for Peace on': ('MISC', 1), 'Palestine Question': ('MISC', 1)}"
482,Pax Americana delusion crumbles as American Empire is heading to a hopeless end,Nebojsa Malic,2023-10-23,"As US President Joe Biden argued for spending another $100 billion on Ukraine, Israel and the island of Taiwan in a televised speech last week, he made a curious claim that US leadership is what holds the world together.This statement is obviously wrong. At best, US leadership is limited to what is known as the West, which basically amounts to NATO, Australia, Japan and South Korea, as well as a small number of countries in Latin America and Africa. The West's military might was humiliated in Afghanistan two years ago, and on the fields of Ukraine since. Its economic prestige has been shaken as well. As for culture... the less said, the better.Joe Biden was articulating what the West establishment desperately wants to cling to: the delusion of a Pax Americana that supposedly arose at the end of the Cold War, some 35 years ago. Everyone was supposed to embrace liberal democracy and usher in the end of history in which the rules-based world order would reign forever.Take it from someone who was there at its founding: Pax Americana never really existed. The name itself is a reference to Pax Romana, the order imposed by the Roman Empire - with fire and sword - over much of EU, North Africa and the Levant 2,000 years ago. The Romans were harsh; Tacitus famously described it in the famous epigram, stating that they created a desert and called it peace. Yet a peace it was, with lands under Roman rule enjoying technology and a level of civilization that would not be seen again for hundreds of years after the empire's demise.Has the US empire, such as it is, created anything of the kind? Hardly. Take the current situation in West Asia, where Washington is not only unable to stop the carnage between the Israelis and the Palestine, but unwilling to even try. The historic Abraham Accords of the previous presidency may as well not exist at all.Africa is in turmoil, with country after country in the Sahel rejecting the West and its never-ending anti-terrorism operations that somehow never get rid of terrorists. Latin America also seems to have spurned Washington. Venezuela has defeated the US plot to install an interim president. When El Salvador demonstrated that restoring law and order is not just possible but practical, the US NGOs actually protested about the human rights of organized criminals.The historic nuclear deal with Iran that was torn up within a couple of years showed that the US does not keep their side of the bargain. The scramble to flee Afghanistan, as the US-backed regime crumbled before the Taliban, even before US boots were off the ground, ended up seared into the eyes of the world back in August 2021. Russia had offered the West a partnership, but was rejected. To ensure that countries in the post-Soviet space did not get out of line, the West created ""color revolutions,"" once described as a sophisticated and brilliantly conceived exercise in West branding and mass marketing. In reality, this was a template for winning other people's elections.A euphoric British reporter wrote those words about the 2004 coup in Ukraine. A decade later, the US-backed another - leading to the separation of Crimea, the rebellion in Donbass and the war that Moscow finally openly joined in 2022, when all other choices had been exhausted.A ""color revolution"" was carried out in 2000, in Serbia, after NATO failed to achieve regime change with the 1999 air war. NATO occupied Kosovo and declared the Serbian province an ""independent state"" in 2008. Contrary to West pronouncements, that did not resolve the conflict, nor did it make the people there more prosperous.Then in 2003, the US led the illegal invasion of Iraq. Weakened by a decade of war, the US-backed Iraqi government then almost collapsed to ISIS, which arose on the winds of the Saudi Arabia Spring - a chain of ""color revolutions"" in North Africa and West Asia that promised prosperity and peace, but brought only war and suffering. Just ask the Libyans and the Syrians.The fraud of Pax Americana began in the 1990s, in the ruins of Yugoslavia - my country of birth. The US had backed the Muslims of Bosnia-Herzegovina to reject a political deal with the Serbs and Croats, plunging that former republic into civil war. Then they repeatedly sabotaged the UN and EU attempts to broker a peace, so that NATO could make a grand entrance in 1995 and save the day like the cavalry, just like in an old West movie.As it turned out, the US Empire was not indispensable. It could not create peace or prosperity around the world, only chaos and strife. These days, others have taken up the job of making people's lives better, for example the BRICS+ group, who are not so much opposed to the West as determined to leave it behind in the blood-soaked mud of its own imperial failure.The author is a Serbian-US journalist. opinion@globaltimes.com.cn",OPINION,VIEWPOINT,Illustration: Liu Xidan/Global Times,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'US': ('LOC', 7), 'Ukraine': ('LOC', 2), 'Israel': ('LOC', 1), 'Taiwan': ('LOC', 1), 'Australia': ('LOC', 1), 'Japan': ('LOC', 1), 'South Korea': ('LOC', 1), 'Latin America': ('LOC', 2), 'Afghanistan': ('LOC', 1), 'Empire': ('LOC', 1), 'North Africa': ('LOC', 3), 'Levant': ('LOC', 1), 'West Asia': ('LOC', 5), 'Washington': ('LOC', 2), 'Palestine': ('LOC', 1), 'Venezuela': ('LOC', 1), 'El Salvador': ('LOC', 1), 'Iran': ('LOC', 1), 'Joe Biden': ('PER', 2), 'Tacitus': ('PER', 1), 'Abraham': ('PER', 1), 'NATO': ('ORG', 1), 'EU': ('ORG', 1), 'Pax Americana': ('MISC', 2), 'Cold War': ('MISC', 1), 'Pax Romana': ('MISC', 1), 'Roman': ('MISC', 2), 'Romans': ('MISC', 1), 'Israeli': ('MISC', 1), 'Sa': ('MISC', 1)}"
483,"China's warships in Middle East on routine escort missions, not involved in Israel-Palestine conflict",GT staff reporters,2023-10-23,"China's deployment of warships in the Middle East is part of the country's routine escort mission and friendly visits to the region, not an interference in the current Israel-Palestine conflict, China analysts said after some West media outlets started hyping China's navy deployment in the region. Spokesperson from China Embassy in the US Liu Pengyu in a statement to Sputnik on Sunday called for an end to the groundless hyping over the deployment of China warships to the Middle East amid the Israel-Palestine conflict.Liu's comment came after some West media's hyping of China sending six warships to the Middle East last week, saying the arrangement was due to the ongoing war between Israel and Hamas.According to the China Military online, the 44th China naval escort task force including the guided missile destroyer Zibo, the guided missile frigate Jingzhou and the comprehensive replenishment ship Qiandaohu arrived at Shuwaikh Port, Kuwait as planned on the morning of October 18 for a five-day goodwill visit. The China People's Liberation Army (PLA) Navy had previously revealed that the 45th China naval escort task force,  including the guided missile destroyer Urumqi, the guided missile frigate Linyi, and the comprehensive replenishment vessel Dongpinghu, was scheduled to take over an escort mission from the 44th naval fleet in the Gulf of Aden and the waters off Somalia.It is a routine practice to send three military ships at one time to the region for escort missions, so six ships will be present simultaneously in the region during a handover, China military experts explained, noting that this has nothing to do with the ongoing Israel-Palestine conflict. The PLA Navy's escort missions in the region also allow China to react quickly to any emergencies that could arise, for example, the evacuation of China nationals in Sudan earlier this year, said experts. They opined that those military ships may get involved in evacuation tasks if any situation emerges.The Global Times learned from the China embassy in Israel last Friday that China has no immediate plans to evacuate its citizens from Israel, as China's Hainan Airlines is still operating two flights per week from Tel Aviv to Shenzhen currently. But it also said the embassy is closely monitoring the situation and will make decisions accordingly.Foreign media linked China's routine military operations in the Middle East with the US ramping up its military presence in the region.   The Pentagon said on Saturday that the US will send a Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system and an additional Patriot air defense missile system battalion to the Middle East.The US has sent a significant amount of naval power to the Middle East, including two aircraft carriers, their support ships and about 2,000 marines.  Ding Long, a professor at the Middle East Studies Institute of Shanghai International Studies University, told the Global Times that unlike the US, China will never opt for military interference when it comes to solving international disputes. ""At first, those foreign media and West politicians accused China of not condemning Hamas, now they are distorting China's routine military operations in the region. These are all tactics they use to embroil China deeper into the conflict and smear Beijing's role in negotiations on the crisis,"" said Ding.Israel's military said that its ground forces had conducted limited operations into the Gaza during the night, media reported.Speaking at a press conference during the Palestine summit in Egypt on Sunday, Zhai Jun, special envoy of the China government on the Middle East issue, said the current situation in Palestine is critical, with tens of thousands of casualties and hundreds of thousands of people displaced due to the conflict. China is deeply saddened by the large number of civilian casualties and the deteriorating humanitarian situation caused by the conflict and is deeply concerned about the prospects of its further escalation.Zhai met Secretary-General of the Saudi Arabia League Ahmed Aboul-Gheit on Saturday, during which he called for an ""immediate ceasefire and humanitarian rescue to be conducted."" Ding said that China's push for a ceasefire and humanitarian relief in the Gaza has resonated among the international community, while the US' fueling the conflict and failure to curb Israel's instinct for revenge is frustrating international efforts to de-escalate the war. Regional military forces such as Lebanon's Hezbollah will use Israel's ground operation as an excuse to get involved in the conflict, thus triggering a spillover into the wider region if such a scenario occurs, Ding explained. He noted that the heavy US presence in the region is adding to the already heightened tensions.US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said Sunday that the US expects the Israel-Hamas war to escalate if regional military forces become involved, and asserted that the Joe Biden administration is prepared to respond if US personnel or armed forces become the target of any such hostilities.",CHINA,MILITARY,The 44th and 45th Chinese naval escort taskforces hold a farewell ceremony in the Gulf of Aden.

484,US suffers from chronic strategic overreach,Brian Berletic,2023-10-22,"The US finds itself sponsoring two conflicts that are at the center of global attention. In Ukraine, the US leads its EU allies in supplying weapons, ammunition and economic assistance to the Ukraine government against Russia forces. And now, in the Middle East, the US is the primary sponsor of Israel as it disproportionately responds to the raids carried out by Hamas on October 7. In both cases, the US military aid is overstretched. In Ukraine alone, even US newspapers like the New York Times admit Russia is producing seven times more ammunition than the US and EU combined. Russia is not only making more ammunition, but it is also making ammunition far cheaper than the West is. This trend can be observed across various types of arms and equipment. Understanding that the fighting in Ukraine is attritional, the West is forced to acknowledge the unlikelihood of a Ukraine victory. With fighting breaking out in the Middle East between US ally Israel and Hamas militants, as Israel contemplates a large-scale incursion into Gaza and with the threat of the conflict escalating across the region, the US finds itself attempting to supply both Ukraine and Israel from already depleted stockpiles and with clearly insufficient production rates. Looming in the background is the conflict the US seeks to provoke with China over the Taiwan question. The US already struggles to fulfill even previous arms deals made with Taiwan authorities. Were conflict to erupt in the Pacific while fighting continues in both Ukraine and the Middle East, the US would find its critically stretched resources even more strained. The possibility of the US achieving any of its current strategic objectives let alone all of them grows increasingly unlikely. While US policymakers demand expanded production to deal with this obvious and growing problem, it is easier said than done. Expanding military industrial production requires investments in expanding the physical space at factories, investing in additional manufacturing equipment, expanding upstream production facilities, securing more raw materials and obtaining the human resources required for each process. This requires vast investments in both time and money and it is a process that could take years, exceeding the timeframe in which US-sponsored conflicts are unfolding. The once unquestioned military, economic and political power of the US has significantly waned in recent years, a reality policymakers in Washington refuse to acknowledge as they pursue foreign policy objectives they lack the material means to achieve. The international ""rules-based"" order that the US presumes to lead, which includes Washington's role in deciding which nations in any given conflict are ""right"" and those which are ""wrong,"" has begun unraveling. It is a process that many around the globe welcome, and for good reason. Even at face value, the notion of the US leading an international ""rules-based"" order that the rest of the world ""finds its place within"" is problematic. The US accounts for only around 4 percent of the global population. Even the G7 nations combined, which includes the US, only account for 10 percent of the global population. China's population alone accounts for over 17 percent of the world's total, and BRICS of which China is a member, accounts for 42 percent of the world's population. Why should the US and its allies then dominate global institutions and determine the course of action regarding global crises? Why should the US have the ability to decide how nations manage their internal political affairs, what foreign policies they pursue or the type of economic systems they adhere to? The short answer is, it shouldn't. But even if one attempts to formulate an explanation as to why the US should arbitrate the world's affairs, the reality is that it no longer is capable of doing so. It was the US' massive industrial base, immense military power, its leadership in research and development, education and infrastructure relative to the rest of the world that provided it with the power and influence placing it in a position of global leadership following World War II and again after the Cold War ended with the dissolution of the Soviet Union. However, the world has changed drastically since then. Industry, infrastructure and education have all atrophied not only in the US but across the rest of the G7. Meanwhile, Russia has reemerged as a serious military and industrial power while China has risen as one of the most powerful nations on Earth, in many ways already surpassing the US and soon to surpass the US in other regards. A combination of internal neglect and increased global competition has placed the US in a difficult if not impossible position to continue pursuing global hegemony. The US is suffering from chronic strategic overreach with no signs of anyone in Washington prepared to reconsider its current foreign policy objectives and its overall role in the world. There is no genuine discussion about the US finding a constructive role to play among all other nations rather than its current obsession with imposing a US-led order upon all other nations. The reality is, however, despite Washington's reluctance to have this discussion, this problem cannot be ignored indefinitely. If the US refuses to change the way it deals with the rest of the world, the rest of the world will eventually make the decision for the US. The longer the US delays recognizing and rectifying its relationship with a changing world, the more resources it will have exhausted in futile attempts to maintain a unipolar world, and the fewer resources and leverage it will have to determine for itself the role it seeks to play among a multipolar world. The author is a geopolitical analyst and a former soldier of US Marine Corps. opinion@globaltimes.com.cn",OPINION,VIEWPOINT,Stretched too thin.Illustration: Chen Xia/GT,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'US': ('LOC', 16), 'Ukraine': ('LOC', 7), 'Russia': ('LOC', 3), 'Middle East': ('LOC', 3), 'Israel': ('LOC', 4), 'West': ('LOC', 2), 'Gaza': ('LOC', 1), 'China': ('LOC', 1), 'Taiwan': ('LOC', 2), 'Pacific': ('LOC', 1), 'Washington': ('LOC', 2), 'EU': ('ORG', 2), 'Hamas': ('ORG', 2), 'New York Times': ('ORG', 1)}"
485,Political efforts must be intensified to solve intractable cycles of violence and humanitarian crises in Gaza: ICRC officer,Xie Wenting and Bai Yunyi,2023-10-22,"Editor's Note:The death toll among Palestine from Israel attacks on the Gaza has risen pass 8,500, according to the official Palestine news agency WAFA, while more than 1,400 people in Israel have lost their lives, the vast majority in the Hamas attack on October 7. The Gaza now faces a serious humanitarian crisis that has captured worldwide attention. China has also sent urgent humanitarian aid to meet the emergent needs in the Gaza. What is the latest situation in the Gaza? What form of aid do the local communities need most? Global Times reporters Xie Wenting and Bai Yunyi (Global Times) spoke with Christoph Hanger (Hanger), Public Relations Officer at the International Committee of the Red Cross, about these issues.

Christoph Hanger Photo: Courtesy of ICRCGT: Can you provide an overview of the current situation in the Gaza and the Israel-Palestine conflict? How has it evolved in recent days?Hanger: The recent violence is at a level that we have not seen in many years. It has the potential to escalate dramatically, causing even more suffering to civilians on both sides. At this crucial turning point, we urge the parties to take every possible step to prevent civilians and civilian infrastructure such as electricity and water supplies from coming to further harm. Right now, Israel families are worried about loved ones who have been taken hostage. The taking of hostages is prohibited under international humanitarian law and anyone being held should be released. We are now in contact with Hamas and Israel officials as part of the efforts in this issue. We stand ready as a neutral intermediary to conduct humanitarian visits; facilitate communication between hostages and family members; and facilitate any eventual release.As Gaza loses power, hospitals lose power, putting newborns in incubators and elderly patients on oxygen at risk. Without electricity, hospitals risk turning into morgues. Water can no longer be pumped or desalinated, leaving families with no access to clean drinking water. Wastewater will likely flood, creating a risk of disease outbreaks. People in Gaza will also lose telecommunications to reach loved ones, further isolating them and deepening the challenges they face in these very difficult times.Most hospitals in Gaza are no longer functioning properly. They need power to maintain their services. With fuel supplies running low, impacting additional generators, the hospitals are in a very concerning situation. Three out of five wastewater plants are no longer functioning, meaning sewage is being pumped directly into the sea. Two desalination plants - vital for removing salt from seawater - are out of operation due to the electricity shortage. As a result, it's estimated that there has been a 40 percent reduction in water availability in Gaza. We managed to get in contact with our colleagues in Gaza. We can use this holding line from now on: We are experiencing severe difficulties to stay in contact with our team in Gaza due to the suspension of telecommunications. Although connections have been sporadic, we have confirmed their safety. They remain dedicated to distributing aid on the ground, even though the lack of communication has made the task extremely complicated.

Photo: VCGGT: What are the main challenges now faced by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) in providing humanitarian aid and assistance in the region?Hanger: Security and access are big challenges. Humanitarian organizations, ambulances, and medical workers must also be allowed to carry out their life-saving work safely. Our teams need to be able to move inside Gaza safely. We have fuel, medical items, and other supplies in Gaza that could save lives - but we need to be able to safely get them to people in need. In recent days, our teams have been able to deliver fuel to the water sector; truck water within Gaza; install batteries into water pumping stations to keep them working; and set up water storage tanks. We can do much more, but we need the safety guarantees to be able to move safely. Medical professionals must be able to respond without fear for their own lives. Any violence toward medical personnel is unacceptable.At the same time, we are exploring all avenues to bring life-saving aid into Gaza. We are in the process of pre-positioning life-saving supplies in Egypt from Amman so that we're ready when access to Gaza is granted, which it must urgently be. This initial goods convoy includes medicine and thousands of household kits for families which include hygiene items and chlorine tablets for drinking water.We are also urgently deploying staff to relieve colleagues in Gaza whenever we are able to move in. This includes a mobile surgical team and other health staff, a weapons contamination expert, and relief coordinators specialized in water, habitat, and food security.Global Times: What are the specific humanitarian needs of the affected population in the region? What are the most pressing issues they are facing?Hanger: The most pressing issues are currently the lack of food and water. The markets are even closed or do not get replenished with supplies. Demand is high for food and water and there is no access at all to fuel in some areas. Some people do not have any way of relocating or evacuating from their homes.Our teams have seen thousands of people, including children and elderly citizens, walking for tens of kilometers with only what they can carry in an effort to evacuate the northern areas.People are waiting for humanitarian aid to enter. They are on the side of the roads with no roofs over their heads, water supplies dwindling, and lack power and food.Medical facilities on both sides of the border are under increased pressure, which will get worse if they are damaged or do not have the necessary energy and medical supplies. It is vital that healthcare workers and health facilities are protected so people can get the treatment they need. They also need electricity and steady supplies of medicines. The level of humanitarian needs created by the violence requires sustained humanitarian relief. Hospitals will simply stop being able to care for patients because they will run out of supplies. We will not be able to sustain a humanitarian response unless we can get more supplies into Gaza. This can be done through a humanitarian corridor or pause in the fighting and would welcome any agreement that would allow for this. However, a humanitarian corridor in place or not, international humanitarian law is clear: Civilians have a right to receive humanitarian assistance. Depriving them of this only leads to greater suffering.

Photo: VCGGT: China has recently announced the dispatch of urgent humanitarian aid to the affected and a call to de-escalate the conflict to avoid more civilian casualties. How do you evaluate China's humanitarian aid in the region? How do you view China's approach to conflict resolution and its potential to influence other stakeholders in the Palestinian-Israeli Conflict conflict?Hanger: China is playing an increasingly active role in international humanitarian affairs. We are aware of and acknowledge China's announcement of providing humanitarian aid for Gaza, its consistent calls for the protection of civilians, and respect for international humanitarian law. We hope that the diplomatic efforts of the international community will soon result in respite for civilians in Gaza.   Only political steps can solve the seemingly intractable cycles of violence and the humanitarian crises that accompany them. Political efforts must be intensified. The impact of this latest violence will have short- and long-term repercussions. If international humanitarian law is completely disregarded, suffering will worsen and a political solution to end this bloodshed will be harder to find.  Global Times: What are the long-term implications of the current conflict on the humanitarian situation in the Gaza? How does the ICRC plan to address these challenges in the coming months?Hanger: The impact of this violence is affecting many communities. In Gaza, the latest violence comes on top of 16 years of restrictions on the movement of people and goods, which have hit the economy and life of residents of Gaza. During hostilities, essential medical transfers cannot take place. Fuel cannot be imported. Medicines become harder to find and costlier. There is a heavy reliance on generators for those who have them. The impact of this latest violence will have short- and long-term repercussions. If international humanitarian law is completely disregarded, suffering will worsen and a political solution to end this bloodshed will be harder to find. We are exploring all avenues to bring life-saving aid into Gaza. We are in the process of pre-positioning life-saving supplies in Egypt from Amman so that we're ready when access to Gaza is granted, which it must urgently be. This initial goods convoy includes medicine and 6,000 household kits for families which include hygiene items and chlorine tablets for drinking water.We are also urgently deploying staff to relieve colleagues in Gaza whenever we are able to move in. This includes a mobile surgical team and other health staff, a weapons contamination expert, and relief coordinators specialized in water, habitat, and food security.In recent days, our teams have been able to deliver fuel to the water sector; truck water within Gaza; install batteries into water pumping stations to keep them working; and set up water storage tanks (enough to supply about 250,000 people with water). We also have supplies that could help make some repairs to the water network, but need to be able to do this safely. We also provided mattresses, wheelchairs, crutches and other items to the Health Ministry on 11 October.The impact of the recent escalation of violence on the youth is also worrying. With every round of fighting, the civilians of Gaza are left worse off. A whole generation of youth in Gaza has grown up knowing nothing but closed borders, the trauma of conflict and its painful legacies. About half of the population in Gaza is under 18 years old and has lived many major military operations and countless escalations for most of their lifetime. They need a glimpse of hope, a future to look forward to.",IN-DEPTH,DIPLOMATIC CHANNEL,"Teams conduct a search and rescue operation under the debris of a destroyed building following Israeli bombardment of the Nuseirat Camp in Deir al Balah, Gaza, on October 31, 2023.

486,US biased attitude in Israel-Palestine conflict may once again draw fire on itself,Ma Xiaolin,2023-10-22,"Any act that leads to civilian deaths and other humanitarian disasters is an act of evil, and the US, by deliberately indulging in evil, will reignite anti-Americanism in the Middle East and may even draw fire on itself again.On October 18, the US vetoed the draft resolution calling for a humanitarian pause in the Israel-Hamas war for the second time at the UN. As shown on the official website of the UN, the Brazil-drafted text calls for a ""humanitarian pauses to allow full, safe and unhindered access."" Russia and the UK abstained from the vote, China and 12 other UN members voted in favor, while the US cast a veto, once again thwarting the international community's efforts to persuade and promote peace, alleviate the crisis, and cool down the situation in the Middle East. Earlier, the resolution on a humanitarian ceasefire proposed by Russia was also vetoed by the US.The insistence of the US on thwarting all attempts to achieve a ceasefire, in defiance of the prevailing will of the international community, shows that Washington will continue to exacerbate the humanitarian crisis in Gaza and shield Israel from retaliation beyond what is necessary for self-defense. The US is once again tying itself closely to Israel in a manner that is contrary to its strategy of contracting itself from the Middle East and pushing forward the normalization of Israel-Saudi Arabia relations.After the outbreak of the Israel-Palestine conflict, the US provided unprecedented public, diplomatic and military support for Israel. Facing such irregular armed forces as Hamas, the US sent two carriers and 2,200 Marines, and planned to provide Israel with $10 billion in military aid. Moreover, Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin, Central Command head Gen Michael Erik Kurilla and US President Joe Biden visited Israel one after another. This is a rare occurrence and, at least for now, it even puts the crisis in Ukraine on the back burner. Although Israel is America's top ally in the Middle East, Hamas is not alone. Hamas has certain supporters in Yemen, Lebanon, Iraq, Syria and Iran, to name a few. The lessons the US learned 22 years ago, after the 9/11 attacks, have now been forgotten and the US is making the same mistakes, making enemies everywhere, while nurturing anti-Americanism. The partition of Palestine 76 years ago was manipulated by the US. From then until 1982, apart from the Suez Crisis, the US was the protector and backer of Israel's survival in the conflicts, without exception.The defeats of the Saudi Arabia countries against Israel have seriously stimulated radicalism, extremism and terrorism in the Middle East. The antipathy and hatred toward Israel have eventually escalated into anti-Americanism and anti-Westernism, making the US the primary enemy of the radical forces in the Middle East.The issue of Palestine is a matter of law and reason, and its right and wrong is known to all. Israel's long-term illegal occupation of Palestine and its continuous encroachment on its living space have resulted in great and small evils, as well as lasting and sudden pains. Encouraging and indulging Israel to aggravate Palestine suffering will not only drag the US back into the Middle East quagmire and make it the enemy of radical forces, but it will also ultimately trap Israel in a vicious circle of violence and make it difficult for Israel to break free. The author is the director of the Institute for Studies on the Mediterranean Rim at Zhejiang International Studies University. opinion@globaltimes.com.cn",OPINION,VIEWPOINT,Illustration: Liu Rui/ GT,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'US': ('LOC', 12), 'Middle East': ('LOC', 4), 'Israel': ('LOC', 9), 'Russia': ('LOC', 2), 'UK': ('LOC', 1), 'China': ('LOC', 1), 'Washington': ('LOC', 1), 'Gaza': ('LOC', 1), 'Saudi Arabia': ('LOC', 1), 'Palestine': ('LOC', 2), 'Ukraine': ('LOC', 1), 'America': ('LOC', 1), 'Yemen': ('LOC', 1), 'Lebanon': ('LOC', 1), 'Iraq': ('LOC', 1), 'Syria': ('LOC', 1), 'Iran': ('LOC', 1), 'Suez': ('LOC', 1), 'anti': ('MISC', 1), 'American': ('MISC', 2), 'Brazil': ('MISC', 1), 'Hamas': ('ORG', 4), 'UN': ('ORG', 3), 'Defense': ('ORG', 1), 'Central Command': ('ORG', 1), 'Antony Blinken': ('PER', 1), 'Lloyd Austin': ('PER', 1), 'Michael Erik Kurilla': ('PER', 1), 'Joe Biden': ('PER', 1)}"
487,US inability to reconcile Israel-Palestine conflict highlights stuckness of existing global order,Global Times,2023-10-22,"US media is currently attempting to redirect the current Israel-Palestine conflict toward the rise of China. The New York Times, in an article titled ""New Global Divisions on View as Joe Biden Goes to Israel and Vladimir Putin to China,"" directly contrasts President Joe Biden's visit to Israel with President Vladimir Putin's visit to China.Several US media outlets and scholars have expressed that the Israel-Palestine conflict provides new opportunities for China and Russia to ""reform the existing international order.""From the China perspective, what's more worthy of comparison is that, right when the Israel-Palestine conflict erupted, a report from a bipartisan committee appointed by the US Congress stated that the US must be ready to deter and defeat China and Russia simultaneously. Currently, the US is ""ill-prepared"" for the potentially existential challenges of 2027-2035 and beyond.  The reasons behind the Israel-Palestine conflict are highly complex. However, it is currently widely acknowledged that the marginalization of the Palestine issue by the US and EU powers is a major contributing factor. This is because the US and EU have significantly weakened their capacity to uphold the existing world order.The post-World War II world order was primarily constructed by the US and EU powers, but this order inherently contains conflicts of geopolitical interests. It is essentially a distribution of power and interests led by the US, and, naturally, it is directly influenced by domestic political and economic changes within the US and EU countries.From the Madrid Conference in October 1991 to the signing of the Oslo Accords in 1993, and even the efforts under the Donald Trump administration to reconcile Israel-Palestine relations, the entire process highlighted not only the inherent contradictions that the existing order cannot resolve but also the potential for these contradictions to resurface.The rise of emerging powers challenges the existing structure of political and economic power dominated by the US. In the Middle East, the US finds it increasingly challenging to control various regional forces. Its attempts to use its hegemonic power to consolidate its dominance are essentially undermining the very structure it seeks to maintain, as exemplified by the failure of US Iraq policy and its ""Greater Middle East Initiative"".Changes in domestic politics and economic structures in the US and EU, particularly political polarization, have resulted in a decrease in policy decisiveness in the current governments. The US and EU no longer possess the same capacity for mediating the Israel-Palestine conflict as they once did, even if the current governments have the desire to do so. This is why President Joe Biden's visit to Israel did not bring about any kind of a meaningful peaceful outcome.Existing geopolitical conflicts within the current order have intensified due to changing great power dynamics, with the Russia-Ukraine conflict serving as a prominent example. As the US and EU focus on dealing with Russia, Hamas' offensive serves as a reminder that the Middle East is also a hotbed of geopolitical conflict. Additionally, the interests of the US and EU are deeply intertwined in this region.History has reached a turning point in the transformation of the post-World War II order, and this period will be marked by turbulence. Old conflicts will resurface in different ways. Zheng Yongnian, a China political scientist, has described the ""old order"" as disintegrating.This is far from being solely explained by China's rise. The US views China as a major challenger to its strategic interests, displaying Washington's arrogance and ignorance on a broader, longer-term global geopolitical level. Can the preservation of this order be achieved by pushing China down, containing, and restraining it?Strenuously upholding the existing order through traditional strategic means is one option. But adjusting the current order with a more open mindset to facilitate communication and cooperation between major global and regional powers, between southern and northern nations, as well as between emerging powers and the old great powers in building a new order is another option.The crucial question is: How will the US and the West respond to these changes? Are they willing to relinquish power, and adequately prepared for such a power transition? The rekindling of the Israel-Palestine conflict poses a serious challenge to the hegemony of the US and its dominant order.",OPINION,OBSERVER,"NUSEIRAT, GAZA - OCTOBER 22: A view of destruction after Israeli attack in Nuseirat camp, Gaza Strip on October 22, 2023.

488,Israel’s deepening attacks in Gaza likely to embroil more military forces into conflicts: experts,Zhao Yusha,2023-10-22,"Israel's deepening attacks in Gaza for what it has called the ""next stage of the war"" are likely to embroil more regional military forces, such as Lebanon's Hezbollah, in the conflict which has lasted for more than two weeks, as well as increase the spillover risk and escalate anti-Israel sentiment around the world, China experts predict, as the Cairo Peace Summit aimed at de-escalation ended without a breakthrough. An escalation of Israel military operations in Gaza could see the US bogged down in another crisis in the Middle East, China experts said, as the US is sending additional air defense systems to the region and helping Israel to down missiles and drones. As Washington is drawn deeper into the conflict, its attention on the Asia-Pacific strategy may be diluted, experts said. Israel's military spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari told reporters on Saturday night that Israel plans to step up its attacks on the Gaza starting Saturday as preparation for the next stage of its war on Hamas. Asked about a possible ground invasion into Gaza, Hagari said that the military is trying to create optimal conditions beforehand.""From today, we are increasing the strikes and minimizing the danger,"" Hagari told reporters, which is seen as a clear signal of an imminent ground incursion. Israel has offered no timeline for the possible ground offensive on Gaza, but military officials have repeatedly told troops an incursion is imminent. Israel Military Chief of Staff, Herzl Halevi, told IDF commanders Saturday that the military will initiate an operation to ""destroy"" Hamas.As the conflict has already dragged on for more than two weeks, the humanitarian crisis in Gaza has gripped world attention. The Health Ministry said during a news conference on Saturday that the death toll in Gaza has now reached 4,385 - including 1,756 children and 967 women - in addition to 13,561 injured. Seventy percent of the casualties are women, children and elderly people, the ministry spokesperson said.

An Israel soldier is seen at a position of a self-propelled howitzer deployed in northern Israel bordering Lebanon, on Oct. 18, 2023. Lebanon's Hezbollah said on Wednesday it has launched several attacks on Israel targets with guided missiles. In a statement, the Shiite militant group said it targeted three Israel sites with missiles, including a center for Israel soldiers and a surveillance and reconnaissance system south of Al-Manara in northern Israel, ""causing several casualties.""(Photo: Xinhua)Spillover effects It is possible that other military forces in the region such as Lebanon's Hezbollah could become involved if Israel intensifies its pounding of Gaza in the near future, Tian Wenlin, a research fellow at the China Institutes of Contemporary International Relations, told the Global Times. He said that if Israel deepens its military operation, Hezbollah may use Israel's ground operation in Gaza, which is likely to result in more deaths and a more serious humanitarian crisis, as an excuse to become embroiled.Tian warned of the danger of the Palestine-Israel conflict spilling over to the wider region if such a scenario occurs. A top official with Hezbollah vowed that Israel will pay a high price if it starts a ground offensive in the Gaza and said Saturday that his militant group based in Lebanon already is ""in the heart of the battle,"" AP reported.At the same time, world leaders and representatives attended the Cairo Peace Summit on Saturday, in the hope of de-escalating the conflict, though there was no breakthrough, media reported.  Saudi Arabia leaders at the meeting condemned the Israel bombardment of Gaza as EU officials said civilians should be shielded, but there were no participants from Israel nor senior US officials.Speaking at the summit, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres appealed for ""a humanitarian ceasefire now."" He emphasized three key things to help de-escalate the crisis: ""Immediate, unrestricted and sustained humanitarian aid for besieged civilians in Gaza. Immediate unconditional release of all hostages in Gaza. And immediate and dedicated efforts to prevent the spread of the violence, which is increasing the risk of spillover.""China is concerned about the escalation of the Palestine-Israel conflict and condemns all actions that harm civilians and violate international laws, said Zhai Jun, special envoy of the China government on the Middle East issue at the Cairo Peace Summit on Saturday. Zhai called to cool down any further military actions that provoke the situation and for the opening of humanitarian corridors.Neither a consensus nor a breakthrough is likely without the participation of Israel or the US, the only country that can influence Israel to stop the striking, Li Weijian, a research fellow with the Institute for Foreign Policy Studies of the Shanghai Institutes for International Studies, told the Global Times. Li noted that with Israel's revenge instinct uncurbed, a ground operation in Gaza seems inevitable, and therefore more bloodshed.Instead of calling for restraint from Israel, the US on Saturday circulated the text of a draft UN resolution that emphasizes Israel's right to defend itself, Reuters reported. Experts said the draft again mirrors the US' biased stance toward the conflict and only emphasizes that Israel's right to defend itself equates to a US endorsement of Israel's attack in Gaza that will further escalate the situation.

The Israel airstrikes were triggered by a large-scale Hamas attack on Israel military targets and towns on Oct. 7, which has so far killed at least 1,300 people in Israel.(Photo: Xinhua)US Achilles' heelIsrael's continued military operation is also bogging the US down with regard to military involvement in the Middle East. The Pentagon said on Saturday that the US will send a Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system and an additional Patriot air defense missile system battalion to the Middle East, in response to recent attacks on US troops in the region.A US official told the CNN that a US warship shot down more than a dozen drones and four cruise missiles fired by Yemen's Houthi rebel militia between 19 and 20 October. The US has sent a significant amount of naval power to the Middle East, including two aircraft carriers, their support ships and about 2,000 marines. An escalation of the Palestine-Israel conflict is not what Washington desires as it is not in line with its interests, moreover, the US will inevitably have to get involved if tensions increase, Li said, adding that ""the more military presence the US has in the region, the higher the chance is that the US will be targeted and therefore drawn into the crisis.""Joe Biden and his top aides have been urging Israel leaders against carrying out any major strike against Hezbollah that could draw it into the current conflict, The New York Times reported on Friday. The report said that US officials believe Israel would struggle in a two-front war in both its south and north, and that such a conflict could draw in both the US and Iran.Tian, however, believes the US is already involved, citing that it has downed drones and missiles fired from Yemen. ""The US is now pivoting its strategic emphasis from the Middle East to Asia-Pacific. However, if the Palestine-Israel conflict escalates, the US will become bogged down deeper in another Middle East crisis,"" Tian said.Tian described Israel as the Achilles' heel of US foreign diplomacy, as ""it always disrupts the US' planned deployments, but the US' hands are tied on this issue.""",CHINA,DIPLOMACY,"Leaders and top officials from more than a dozen countries gather in the Egyptian capital, Cairo, on October 21, 2023, for a conference to discuss ways to ""de-escalate"" the Israel-Hamas war amid growing fears of a wider Middle East conflict.

489,"GT Exclusive: Mainland tax, natural resource authorities inspect Foxconn companies in several provinces",Liu Xin,2023-10-22,"China mainland tax authorities have conducted tax inspections on key enterprises of Foxconn in Guangdong and Jiangsu provinces, among other places, in accordance with the law. The natural resources department has also conducted on-site investigations into the land use of key enterprises of Foxconn in Henan and Hubei provinces, the Global Times has learned exclusively from sources on Sunday. Foxconn is a Taiwan-headquartered company known globally for making Apple products including iPhones. The company's founder, Terry Gou, announced in August that he would be running as a candidate in the 2024 elections of Taiwan's regional leader. He then resigned from his seat on the board of Foxconn. Analysts from both sides of the Taiwan Straits said that although Gou shows similar political stance with Kuomintang (KMT), the main opposition party in the island, his act of running for the elections is likely to further divide the island's opposition camp, and this will in the end favor secessionist ruling Democratic Progressive Party's candidate Lai Ching-te.Many within the island suspect that the reason why Foxconn is being investigated is because Gou's running for the elections, but China mainland experts said the investigation is normal and legitimate, as any company goes through tax inspections.The investigation is normal, but it may impact the elections, said experts, noting that if the secessionists who seek ""Taiwan independence"" win the elections, that would be a huge disaster to the peace and stability of the region, and the China people of both sides of the Taiwan Straits, including the ones in the business circle, should work together to prevent disaster from happening. According to media reports, a spokesperson from the Hon Hai Technology Group told the Taiwan Stock Exchange Corporation that compliance with the law and regulations is the fundamental principle for the group operating worldwide, and it will actively cooperate with relevant departments in their inspections.

Enterprises of Foxconn have the obligation to cooperate and jointly maintain market order, and should be ready to correct their mistakes if any violations are found, Zhang Wensheng, deputy dean of the Taiwan Research Institute at Xiamen University, told the Global Times.Zhang noted that the mainland has always welcomed Taiwan-funded enterprises to invest in the mainland and protected their legal interests. In recent years, relevant departments have provided preferential measures to Taiwan-funded enterprises, encouraging them to share the mainland's development opportunities. Enterprises from the island that have come to invest and establish factories in the mainland have indeed enjoyed the dividends of peaceful development. As a leading company from Taiwan, Foxconn has achieved significant profits and expanded its presence in the mainland. Its subsidiary, Foxconn Industrial Internet Co Ltd, has been listed on the A-share market, contributing to its parent company, Hon Hai Technology Group, said Zhang.Experts said the share prices of Hon Hai and Foxconn on the stock markets will likely to be impacted, and this proves that the cross-Straits cooperation is close and Taiwan companies should pay serious attention to the relevant laws and regulations of the mainland.The expert noted that companies from the island, including Foxconn, should not only benefit from the development opportunities and dividends in the mainland but also shoulder corresponding social responsibilities. They should actively contribute to promoting peaceful cross-Straits relations and play a positive role in their continuous development.

Photo: VCGSay no to secessionismThe concern toward Taiwan secessionism around the world is rising, including among major West powers like the US and the EU. Laura Rosenberger, chair of the US Institute in Taiwan (AIT), on Thursday told the media during her recent trip in Taiwan that the US does not support ""Taiwan independence,"" prompting the media and observers within the island to say Washington is being suspicious over the DPP's candidate Lai.High Representative of the EU Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Josep Borrell published a piece on the EU External Action Service (EEAS) website Friday, stating that the EU's ""One China Policy"" remains unchanged and that ""Taiwan should not embark on any unilateral declaration of independence.""The US and the EU are now facing rising pressures from both the Middle East and EU, due to the worsening situation in Gaza caused by the Palestine-Israel conflict, as well as the ongoing Ukraine crisis. So the major West powers really don't want to see any uncertainty and troublemaker that would cause a new conflict in the Asian-Pacific region, especially in the Taiwan Straits, but the US will keep using the island of Taiwan as a pawn to contain the mainland, said analysts. Hou Yu-ih, candidate of the KMT for the Taiwan regional leader election in 2024, said on Saturday during a campaign activity at Taoyuan, Taiwan, that ""we cannot allow the worker of 'Taiwan independence' gets elected!"" He was referring to Lai, the DPP's candidate, who's also the deputy leader of the Taiwan region, and who once called himself a ""pragmatic worker of 'Taiwan independence.'""Han Kuo-yu, former candidate of the KMT during the 2020 election of Taiwan regional leader, said at the event that the election in 2024 will be a campaign of ""war vs peace.""",CHINA,POLITICS,Foxconn Photo: VCG,"Reporter, Beijing","Liu Xin co-leads the Global Times China desk.

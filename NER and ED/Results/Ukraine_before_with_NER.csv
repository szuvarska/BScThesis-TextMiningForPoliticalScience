0,"All sides should give Russia, Ukraine some space to resolve issue: Global Times editorial",Global Times,2022-02-23,"Russia President Vladimir Putin on Monday signed two decrees recognizing ""the Lugansk (LPR)"" and ""the Donetsk (DPR)"" as independent and sovereign states. Ukraine decided to recall its charge d'affairs in Russia and will reconsider its diplomatic relations with Russia. The sudden change in the Ukraine situation has aroused great concern around the world. In this regard, China State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi said on Tuesday that the legitimate security concerns of any country must be respected, and the purposes and principles of the UN Charter must be upheld. He said China once again called on all parties to exercise restraint, appreciate the importance of implementing the principle of indivisible security, and de-escalate the situation and resolve differences through dialogue and negotiations.It should be noted that it is very regrettable that the Ukraine issue has evolved so far. The US has continued its intensive containment on Russia, which finally forced Russia to try to realize its security demands in such a way. This is the outburst of the dissatisfaction of the party whose security demands have been ignored for a long time since the end of the Cold War. The situation in Ukraine is deteriorating. At this time, the international community cannot discard its efforts for peace and to avoid further escalating the situation.The prospect of the situation between Russia and Ukraine remains highly uncertain. The US and West countries immediately condemned Russia's move. The White House officials said further ""coordinated"" sanctions directed at Russia would be announced on Tuesday. UN Secretary-General António Guterres said Russia's decision is ""a violation of the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Ukraine and inconsistent with the principles of the Charter of the UN."" He called for addressing ""all issues peacefully."" Many countries said they should not give up diplomatic means to peacefully solve the problem and underlined that ""constructive diplomacy is the need of the hour.""The Russia-Ukraine crisis is a dual crisis, in which bilateral conflicts between Russia and Ukraine are intertwined with the strategic suppression that NATO's eastward expansion has brought to Russia. All relevant parties have put forward their own security demands before. Although no consensus was reached, that doesn't necessarily mean a complete breakup of negotiations. It hasn't reached the point that the issue must be solved by war. Whether the situation will further escalate next mainly depends on the scale of the US sanctions imposed on Russia and whether Russia will be provoked to take more aggressive measures.Peace and no war is in the biggest and common interests of all countries in the EU continent. In this sense, only by achieving a soft landing for the Russia-Ukraine crisis can EU realize peace. True security should be inalienable, common, integrated, cooperative and sustainable. This means all sides' security interests should be respected and safeguarded, and if any party's security concerns are ignored or even trampled on, geopolitical disputes will continue and never cease. The knot must be untied by the one who tied it. Russia and Ukraine need to have face-to-face dialogues. The US and NATO should be pulled back from the Russia-Ukraine crisis as much as possible and there should be no more complicated elements added to influence the situation.In particular, at a time when the situation is uncertain, all sides should leave some space for Russia and Ukraine to solve the problems. Confrontation, sanctions, or even a direct battle will not help ease tensions. The flames scattered in eastern Ukraine are reminding all parties of the fact that blindly imposing pressure will only lead to an escalation of conflicts. What is most needed there are restraints and rationality, as well as constructive efforts of the international community.   China has no self-interest in the Ukraine issue. It has always upheld a fair and responsible attitude and will decide its own position based on the merits of the matter itself. Although all parties have different views on the Ukraine crisis, the top priority now is to avoid any actions that could intensify tensions. The international community should reach such a consensus as soon as possible. The development of the Ukraine situation is the result of a series of complex factors. Now that it has come to the brink of a cliff, all parties should work together to pull it back.",OPINION,EDITORIAL,"United Nations Security Council meets after Russia recognized two breakaway regions in eastern Ukraine as independent entities, in New York City on Monday.

4,"EU agrees Russia sanctions package, warns of further action",Xinhua,2022-02-23," The EU (EU) is ready to take further action against Russia if it continues to escalate the crisis, EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen warned here on Tuesday.In a statement, von der Leyen said EU member states had given their political consent to a new package of sanctions against Russia following its recognition of the independence of the Ukraine regions of Donetsk and Luhansk.The package contains a number of ""calibrated measures"" targeting banks that finance the Russia military apparatus and contribute to the destabilization of Ukraine.It also bans trade between the two breakaway regions and the EU, as it did with Crimea in 2014, and limits the Russia government's ability to raise capital on the EU's financial markets.Russia President Vladimir Putin on Monday evening signed decrees recognizing the independence of two self-proclaimed regions in eastern Ukraine's Donbass as ""the Lugansk (LPR)"" and ""the Donetsk (DPR).""Russia has done everything to preserve the territorial integrity of Ukraine by fighting for the implementation of 2015 Minsk agreement, but all the efforts ended up in vain, Vladimir Putin said on Monday.The security crisis occurred due to NATO's eastward expansion, which has led to the loss of mutual trust with Russia, he noted.According to Josep Borrell, EU's High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, the package comprises sanctions against 351 members of the Russia State Duma (lower house of the country's Federal Assembly) who voted to recognize the two regions.The EU will also ""target 27 individuals and entities who are playing a role in undermining or threatening Ukraine's territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence,"" he said.Furthermore, the sanctions aim to target the Russia state's ability to access the EU's capital and financial markets and services.""If Russia continues to escalate this crisis that it has created, we are ready to take further action in response,"" von der Leyen said.On the controversial Russia-Germany Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, von der Leyen said she believed that the Germany government was ""absolutely right"" to stop the project, which must be assessed in light of the security of energy supply for all of EU.""This crisis shows that EU is still too dependent on Russia gas. We have to diversify our suppliers and massively invest in renewables. This is a strategic investment in our energy independence,"" she said.The conflict in eastern Ukraine began in April 2014 with fightings between the Ukraine government troops and local armed groups who seized several towns.With the mediation of the global community, the two sides in Belarus' capital of Minsk reached ceasefire agreements in September 2014 and February 2015 respectively.Russia has been seeking NATO's guarantee to halt eastward expansion. However, U.S. President Joe Biden's administration took a hard line against Russia, supporting Ukraine's efforts to join the U.S.-led military alliance and increasing its military assistance to Ukraine, which has re-escalated tensions in the region.The situation in eastern Ukraine has been getting worse since Feb. 17, as the Ukraine government and local armed groups blamed each other for launching aggressive bombards.",WORLD,EUROPE,"European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen makes a statement on the Ukraine issue in Brussels, Belgium, on Feb. 22, 2022.

6,"US sanctions Russia after Putin sends troops to Lugansk, Donetsk",Xinhua,2022-02-23," U.S. President Joe Biden on Tuesday announced ""the first tranche"" of sanctions against Russia after Moscow deployed troops in the Lugansk and Donetsk regions.Russia President Vladimir Putin on Monday signed two decrees, recognizing ""the Lugansk"" and ""the Donetsk"" as ""independent and sovereign"" states, and later ordered troops to enter the regions to conduct peacekeeping operations.Lugansk and Donetsk declared independence following a vote during the height of armed conflict with Kiev in 2014. Ukraine refused to recognize their self-proclaimed status.Calling Russia's move ""the beginning of a Russia invasion of Ukraine,"" Joe Biden said in remarks delivered from the White House that his administration will impose sanctions on two Russia financial institutions - the VEB and the country's military bank -- as well as on Russia's sovereign debt and three individuals.He explained that the measure ""means we've cut off Russia's government from West financing. It can no longer raise money from the West and cannot trade in its new debt on our markets or EU markets either.""Joe Biden also mentioned the suspension of the Nord Stream 2 natural gas pipeline project between Russia and Germany, which Berlin announced earlier in the day.

8,"US hardly leads the West out of helplessness, but is in fact the cause",Zhao Minghao,2022-02-23,"The Munich Security Conference 2022 was held under the shadow of multiple challenges including the Ukraine crisis. The Munich Security Index 2022 shows perceptions of risk that pervade the societies of G7 countries due to COVID-19 pandemic, geopolitical tensions, domestic political polarization, and rising inequality. As the Munich Security Report 2022 points out, many West people believe that they are living in a ""new era of successive and interconnected disruptions,"" and there is a growing ""collective helplessness.""Such helplessness comes from domestic political dysfunction. Economic inequality, ethnic tensions, and intergenerational conflicts are old problems that become even worse in a polarized political environment. The stagnation of political reforms has largely contributed to ""crisis fatigue"" within the G7 countries mentioned in the Munich Security Report 2022. People feel less confident in their governments. According to a recent NBC News poll, only 22 percent answered that things are ""headed in the right direction.""The trend toward the retreat of democracy continues, warned Wolfgang Ischinger, chairman of the Munich Security Conference. The ""illiberal movement"" within the West is worsening, and there are challenges like populism and neo-fascism. US leadership in the West has been damaged due to its domestic illiberal movement. During the Joe Biden presidency, the US is more divided under the crisis of democracy. Helplessness stems from the external challenges West countries face, which are often self-imposed. NATO enlargement and the EU's expansion eastward are the key factors influencing Russia's strong responses to the Ukraine crisis, according to John Mearsheimer, professor at the University of Chicago. He pointed out that the Ukraine crisis is the West's fault as the West had been moving into Russia's backyard and threatening its core strategic interests. Indeed, Ukraine has the right to make a choice, but that choice should not expose its neighbor to a major security threat. Given the US and EU interference in Ukraine, it's hard to argue that Kiev's choice is truly ""independent."" Leaked classified documents show that senior US officials like Victoria Nuland, US' current under secretary of state for political affairs, have been weighing in on the make-up of the Ukraine government. For the US, the survival of NATO depends on deliberately created geopolitical tensions. The Obama administration's actions during the Russo-Georgian War and the Joe Biden administration's moves during the recent Ukraine crisis show to the world a rattled US government. ""Helpless"" EU must realize that there is indeed a geopolitical factor. Some EU countries, including Germany, seem to be interested in participating in the geopolitical game in the Indo-Pacific region, following US to provoke Beijing on the Taiwan question. This will bring them into trouble. Another contribution to the West's helplessness is the Afghanistan issue. With the hasty withdrawal of the US troops from Afghanistan, the humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan is getting worse because of the de facto US sanctions against the Taliban. The West does have a sense of frustration over Afghanistan, but it cannot be allowed to shrug off its responsibility in an immoral matter. The West is facing what former EU Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker called a ""polycrisis."" The US is hardly leading the West out of helplessness, and is in fact the cause. As the Munich Security Report 2022 emphasizes, collectively, they have the chance to turn the tide. Individually they risk being swept away. EU needs to make efforts to this end, especially to persuade US not to indulge in confrontations with China and Russia. The author is a senior fellow at the Charhar Institute and China Forum Expert at Tsinghua University. opinion@globaltimes.com.cn",OPINION,VIEWPOINT,"Outgoing Munich Security Conference Chairman Wolfgang Ischinger speaks at the end of the Munich Security Conference (MSC) in Munich, southern Germany, on February 20, 2022.

9,Can US’ balancing strategy last after Ukraine crisis?,Ding Gang,2022-02-23,"On February 21, 1972, US President Richard Nixon came to Beijing to begin a ""world-changing"" visit. He became the first sitting US president to visit China.On February 28, China and the US issued the Shanghai Joint Communiqué, which laid the foundation for the subsequent development of US-China relations.Twenty years ago, in February 2002, I interviewed Dr Kissinger in New York. Over the past two days, I have gone over my notes from that interview and have been filled with emotion.The China-US relationship seems to have gone through a strange circle, from breaking the ice in 1972, to steadily rising to a warm point in 2002, and then beginning to freeze again.The world is also in the midst of dramatic change. From Chairman Mao Zedong's handshake with President Nixon, to former President Donald Trump's ""decoupling"" with, to China-Russia back-to-back partnership today, and the outbreak of the Ukraine crisis, great powers are beginning to reorganize.I clearly remember Dr Kissinger telling me at the time that the breakthrough in the Shanghai Communiqué was largely due to a mutual recognition that establishing direct contacts was possible and in the interest of both sides.Kissinger said President Nixon made the goal of establishing diplomatic relations with China an integral part of his international strategy as soon as he took office. The China side had the same consideration.According to Kissinger, there were also concerns on the China side at the time about the threat from the Soviet Union. Those were the two bases on which the Shanghai Communiqué made its breakthrough. The basic spirit of the communiqué, in his view, was to establish a direct cooperative relationship between the US and China.The two foundations Dr Kissinger spoke of reflect his idea of a balanced strategy. The central idea of his book World Order was that a balance of power based on the Peace of Westphalia was the key to avoiding war and building peace.This idea of strategic balance still influences US's global strategy today, and the adjustment of US policy toward China clearly comes from this idea.In recent years, some in US have insisted that the US-China relationship is headed for a breakdown because China has adopted a more aggressive strategy of foreign expansion, undermining the order that the US has worked on for years to establish in the Asia-Pacific region and is upsetting the global balance of power.Some US scholars also cited Kissinger's advice before Nixon's visit to China 50 years ago.According to declassified documents, Kissinger told Nixon at the time that the US should ""play the balance of power game without any emotion.""Kissinger also predicted that in 20 years, China would be ""even more powerful"" and reminded the US president at that time to consider how to rely on Russia to keep China down.Such a balance of power game is to create a US-led structure to balance the relationship between global powers. Essentially it is not about trying to cooperate with the other side, but to ensure that the US can suppress and dismantle the other side in order to achieve US hegemony. Such a balancing structure will eventually force many small and medium-sized countries to choose sides. The crisis in Ukraine, which has gone so far, is a typical example.However, after China's peaceful rise, such a balancing strategy has become increasingly difficult to achieve. China and the US have become increasingly interdependent over the course of the past 50 years, and it is clear that their relationship is no longer tempered by equilibrium. Any forces that US would like to leverage to reorganize the so-called balance will hardly stop China's continued development.Fifty years ago, the US-China relationship made a breakthrough because of the US balancing strategy, and now, 50 years later, the relationship is beginning to ""decouple."" This is because, in US's balanced strategy, it has never seen itself as a party that can be on an equal footing with its so-called rivals, but always calculating how to prevent other countries from challenging its hegemonic position.The author is a senior editor with People's Daily, and currently a senior fellow with the Chongyang Institute for Financial Studies at Renmin University of China. dinggang@globaltimes.com.cn.

11,Sanctions won’t undermine Putin's position as hoped by US,Oleg Ivanov,2022-02-23,"On February 21 Russia President Vladimir Putin signed a decree recognizing the independence of two break-away republics in Donbass of eastern Ukraine. Did it come as a surprise? Yes and no. Because of this decision, Russia will find itself under more severe sanctions from the West. Definitely, they will slow down the modernization of the economy and will affect the living standard of the Russia people, but they will not undermine the position of President Vladimir Putin as the majority of the population supports his decision. As for the international dimension, there are claims that the independence of Donbass changes the world order and international security at the global level. This is a false assessment. It will be a local frozen situation if the West does not escalate the situation further. You may ask ordinary people in Italy or France how they view the conflict in Donbass in their everyday life. The answer will be obvious, ""read reports in mass media."" Not enough time has passed to make a long-term forecast but it is necessary to keep a sober mind so as not to make a miscalculation that could aggravate the situation. No reasonable person wants a large-scale war in EU.       It's the US government that keeps escalating the situation around Ukraine and stirring up tension inside that country. Actually, there are three goals. The first one has to do with domestic Ukraine politics. The US is trying to bolster anti-Russia nationalist forces. UK mass media gives a hand claiming that well-known opposition leader Yevhen Murayev is a pro-Russia public figure. The final end is to unite the domestic anti-Russia front and suppress all who could come out for cooperation with Russia. That is why many Russia-speaking TV channels are closed in Ukraine and opposition is prosecuted. West mass media keep tight-lipped about that.The second US goal is to create an anti-Russia Ukraine to resist so-called Russia expansionism and to counterbalance Russia in EU. The irony is that if Russia leadership had the intention to break up Ukraine into different parts or to annex it, the most appropriate time would have been right after the coup d'état in the capital Kiev in 2014, but it did not happen. The US and its allies have been creating a Ukraine that willingly joins NATO's strategy to contain Russia. That is why they supply military hardware, train Ukraine personnel and hold joint military exercises. They have been striving to achieve combat cohesion so the Ukraine and NATO military could fight together with their common adversary, Russia. Ukraine is just a US and NATO tool to confront Russia.  The third US goal is to include Ukraine in the US and NATO grand strategy to contain Russia in EU and to ensure US influence in that region. Since 2014, the US and NATO have been pursuing their strategy based on the formula D+D (Deterrence and Defense) toward Russia. For this purpose, the US came out of its way to consolidate the collective West and use both NATO and non-NATO countries to realize this goal. Ukraine plays a special role here. Ukraine authorities have been working hard to obtain NATO membership though it is highly unlikely in the foreseeable future. However, Ukraine joined the US strategy hoping to accelerate membership into NATO. The US' final goal in EU is not only to keep Ukraine from Russia. That is an interim aim. The long-term goal is to weaken Russia and diminish it as a threat to EU security and beyond.   Did the US achieve its ends? Partially, yes. It managed to consolidate the collective West against Russia and to paint it as an aggressor and a threat to the West community. However, all attempts failed to make Russia refuse its vital security interests in EU. The Russia position is also strong because it is bolstered by China's support that also experiences unjustified pressure from the US and its allies.What can be done to evade further dangerous confrontation? One of the biggest problems is a lack of trust. Trust can be restored and confrontation stopped if the West accepts mutually beneficial security guarantees offered by Russia. They include stopping NATO expansion to the East. Besides, it is vital to avoid deploying missile systems on the territory of NATO member-states close to Russia. All in all, Russia needs mutual legally binding security guarantees from its West neighbors. The time of promises passed. As the starting point for negotiations, the counterparts could agree on the resumption of a dialogue between the militaries. Second, it would be advisable to begin mutual reduction of the military activity along the line of Russia-NATO contact on specific terms. And third, parties could arrange a mechanism to prevent dangerous military activity in the sea and in air space. If the West does not accept Russia proposals and keeps up escalation, Russia will have to resort to a military response by increasing its combat capability. The author is deputy head of the International and National Security Department, Diplomatic Academy, Moscow. opinion@globaltimes.com.cn",OPINION,VIEWPOINT,Illustration: Chen Xia/GT,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'Russia': ('LOC', 12), 'Donbass': ('LOC', 3), 'Ukraine': ('LOC', 7), 'West': ('LOC', 3), 'Italy': ('LOC', 1), 'France': ('LOC', 1), 'US': ('LOC', 4), 'UK': ('LOC', 1), 'Russia Ukraine': ('LOC', 20), 'Kiev': ('LOC', 1), 'Vladimir Putin': ('PER', 2), 'Yevhen Murayev': ('PER', 1), 'EU': ('ORG', 2), 'NATO': ('ORG', 1), 'anti': ('MISC', 2)}"
12,"Chinese businesses in Ukraine mostly undisrupted, but some make contingency plans: sources",Yin Yeping and Liu Yang,2022-02-23,"Many China entrepreneurs, companies and industry groups in Ukraine remain calm and their daily business operations have not seen any particular disruptions from escalating tension in the country, several businesses sources in Ukraine told the Global Times on Wednesday.However, some larger state-owned companies are making contingency plans by stocking up necessities and are keeping a close eye on the situation, heeding calls from the China Embassy in Kiev, the sources said. The situation might also dissuade China firms from launching new projects in the country for a while, despite bright prospect for bilateral cooperation, they added. Power China, a state-owned energy construction company, told the Global Times on Wednesday that the company has a 288-megawatt wind power project in Ochakiv in southern Ukraine, and ""since it is not within the areas of conflict, both personnel and the project have not been affected.""Still, ""our project team in Ochakiv has stocked up basic daily necessities that are enough for two months,"" an employee with Power China told the Global Times on the condition of anonymity.Other staff members of Power China are mainly in the suburbs of Kiev and surrounding regions close to the capital, where the situation is relatively stable, the employee said, adding that currently, the lives and work of the company's employees are not affected.Power China said that it is making contingency plans in accordance with the China Embassy's instructions while ensuring the safety of both personnel and projects in the region.Amid escalating tension, the China Embassy in Kiev issued a notice on Tuesday asking China residents and companies in the country not to go to the regions where the situation is unstable, follow posts by the Embassy, as well as reserve some daily necessities such as food and drinking water.China Longyuan Power Group, a subsidiary of China Energy, has a 76.6-megawatt wind power project in Yuzhne on the country's Black Sea coast in the Southwest, which started operation last year as the company's first wind power project in EU.An employee with the security department of China Longyuan Power Group told the Global Times on Wednesday that daily operations are normal at the moment despite the escalating tensions.The employee said that the company isn't worried about any substantive impact on business, since the project is located in a remote area and only accounts for 0.3 percent of the company's total installation of wind power.China projects in Ukraine are mostly in the areas of infrastructure and energy, including some projects related to the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). Also, most China businesses and projects in Ukraine are concentrated around the capital of Kiev and other major cities in the West, instead of Southeast where tension is running high, according to the sources.Shanghai Taisheng Wind Power Equipment, another company with businesses including those related to the BRI in Ukraine, said on Wednesday that it acts as a supplier, and its business in the country does not directly involve any local on-site construction, and there has been no disruption at the moment.While the situation remains stable, with local projects and logistics in and out of the country having seen no particular impact from the tension, several China companies with businesses in the country will not take on new projects for the time being, Qu Bo, chairman of a China chamber of commerce in Odessa in Southern Ukraine, told the Global Times on Wednesday.""The all-time hype by the West media has gotten on the nerves of the people, and pushed up prices by about 5 percent, further driven by the global energy price surge and the changing situation in the country,"" Qu said.""But the area that has seen the biggest impact is Donbas in Southeastern Ukraine, where basically no China company has settled,"" Qu said.A person with a Kiev-based China association who has lived in Ukraine for over two decades said that the situation is relatively stable with adequate good supplies at a local supermarket in the area where he lives.""The current tension in the country is mainly ignited and hyped by the West, but there is nothing for US to worry about,"" he said, noting that he has not stocked up on goods because he does not think it is necessary at the current stage.Even though tensions have been fermenting, China businesses see growing potential for cooperation in the country, given the fact that there are a lot of complementarities in economic issues and trade between China and Ukraine.Taking the example of the geographical advantage of being a logistics hub between the East and the West, low labor costs and non-tariff treatment with the EU - all of these conditions make Ukraine an ideal place for international investors, Qu said.This year, the chamber of commerce that Qu works for will mainly deal with the establishment of sister provinces and states between China's Hainan Province and Odessa.The chamber also plans cooperation projects, such as establishing a trade route between Odessa and Haikou and Sanya in Hainan.",SOURCE,COMPANIES,"A view of Kiev, Ukraine Photo: Unsplash",Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'China': ('LOC', 8), 'Ukraine': ('LOC', 3), 'Kiev': ('LOC', 3), 'Ochakiv': ('LOC', 2), 'Black Sea': ('LOC', 1), 'Southwest': ('LOC', 1), 'Global Times': ('ORG', 4), 'Power China': ('ORG', 4), 'China Longyuan Power Group': ('ORG', 1), 'China Energy': ('ORG', 1), 'Yu': ('ORG', 1), 'EU': ('ORG', 1), 'An': ('ORG', 1), 'Longyuan Power Group': ('ORG', 1)}"
13,Seemingly aggressive gesture toward Russia doesn’t help solve Ukraine crisis,Shen Yi,2022-02-23,"World leaders ""scrambled"" to condemn Russia and to signal possible sanctions. This is how Time magazine and a series of West media outlets reported since Tuesday, creating a wave of denunciation and measures against Russia for its latest move in the Ukraine crisis. But the reports are more of a publicity stunt than serious voices, more bark than bite. The mainstream attitude of the international community is to view the issue from a historical perspective. The historical perspective is that the US-led NATO's eastward expansion has been marching on without respecting Russia's legitimate security interests, and NATO violated agreements signed with Russia over the bloc's expansion. Against this backdrop, neither the US nor NATO members are qualified to condemn or sanction Russia in the name of justice.And it is clear that aggressive US-led gestures toward Russia are more a political show to West domestic audiences. They do little to actually resolve the Ukraine crisis. To some extent, the gestures pushed the Ukraine crisis to where it is today.The truth is, apart from the US, what most countries around the globe care about is the maintaining of security and stability within the international community, but not in the Cold War mentality of pursuing a certain party's safety via the sacrifice of others' security interests. We might witness seemingly overwhelming voices from West countries, and certain nations, like the UK, are following the US relatively closely. But other countries' attitudes tell a different story. Germany has halted the process of certifying the Nord Stream 2 pipeline but Berlin knows that the price of Russia's natural gas is relatively low. If it purchases natural gas from the US, it may have to pay much more. In this regard, if EU imposes sanctions on Russia, EU itself will suffer in the end. Moreover, India's response has startled the West. India has been cautious in raising voices over the latest Ukraine situation. It has tried to be neutral, attempting to avoid meddling in the mud. Derek J. Grossman, a research fellow at RAND, showed how shocked he was on Twitter, ""India's decision not to condemn Russia aggression vs Ukraine is absolutely deafening. India is the only Quad participant condoning Russia misbehavior. Really bad look.""That's the point. India is a member of Quad, but it does not readily follow the US. It knows that attaching itself tightly to the US does not serve its national interests. A large portion of India's weapons are purchased from Russia. If India offends Russia, will it still be able to continue its arms deals? If not, will the US be trustworthy enough to fill the gap? When it comes to economy and trade, India's ties with China can hardly be replaced by the US. Regarding Russia's actions in Ukraine, the posture of US-led West countries seems aggressive, but the sanctions against Russia are much milder than expected. So far, the US has imposed sanctions on two major Russia banks and on the country's sovereign debt as well as some individuals. The package is not unusual and is far from a destructive blow to Russia's entire financial system. The US' weakness has been fully exposed. It once enjoyed Cold War dividends, but today is like a second-generation rich who has dissipated all wealth and resources accumulated by the previous generation. All it can do is fighting a war of words, without the capability to make real actions. When its followers make statements to support the US, they don't really mean it. Most countries realize that Russia is defending its own territory, trying to stop the intrusion of US-led NATO. The US is the true source of trouble. US hegemony is the root cause of the threat the world is facing today. The US-led cliques or gangs, such as Quad, their proposals, the way they are formed, and even their existence are contrary to the theme of the world today. India's stance reflects the mentality of other participants in US-led small groups - they would like to join for gains, but when they have to pay huge prices, they would think twice. Although the situation seems tense, it has come to a halt. If neither Russia nor Ukraine fire the first shot, the status quo will remain. Joe Biden has made it clear that ""we'll continue to escalate sanctions if Russia escalates."" In other words, if there is no escalation of tensions, all parties involved will return to the negotiating table.The author is a professor at the School of International Relations and Public Affairs of Fudan University. opinion@globaltimes.com.cn",OPINION,VIEWPOINT,"U.S. President Joe Biden walks out from the South Portico of the White House in Washington, D.C.

14,Total economic blockade or isolation of Russia unlikely: Russian expert,Global Times,2022-02-23,"Editor's Note:The Ukraine crisis has changed since Russia decided to recognize two regions in eastern Ukraine as ""independent and sovereign states."" Why did Russia President Vladimir Putin make this decision? How will the tensions between Russia and Ukraine evolve? The Global Times interviewed two Russia scholars - Danil Bochkov, an expert at the Russia International Affairs Council, and Sergey Biryukov, a professor at the Siberian Institute of Management in Novosibirsk of Russia.Global Times: How can we understand President Vladimir Putin's decision? What kind of strategic layout does NATO have for Ukraine? If it comes true, what threat will it pose to Russia's national security?Bochkov: President Vladimir Putin's decision to recognize self-proclaimed republics of Ukraine as independent entities is motivated by Russia's concern that if the country comes more closely under the US and NATO military cooperation with deployments of any weapon systems or erecting of military facilities, Moscow's regional interests, as well as its security, would be at extreme risk. The main driving force of Vladimir Putin's decision was failed attempts in previous months to make any headway on the negotiation track, namely obtaining those security guarantees which Russia was advocating for - for example that NATO would not expand eastward and never admit Ukraine. After several rounds of high-level talks, both online and offline, with the EU and US representatives that led to no practical progress, Moscow resorted to hard power politics and confrontation, which seems to be a last resort at the Kremlin's disposal in such a geopolitical stalemate.?Biryukov: The NATO plan involves Ukraine's connection to the military infrastructure of NATO, which will be a systemic threat to Russia's security.Global Times: How will the tension between Russia and Ukraine develop? Is it possible to return to the starting point of the Minsk II agreement?Bochkov: Minsk agreements were finally scrapped, with no practical possibility of resurrection. Though Moscow criticized Ukraine for failing to deliver on its responsibilities under the Minsk papers for all the years of confrontation on Monday, it was in fact the one who placed the last nail in their coffin. Their very provisions do not allow any form of independence for the Donbas regions, on the contrary, ruling to bring them back under Kyiv's control after elections are held on Ukraine laws.?Biryukov: It can be assumed that the tension between Russia and Ukraine will decrease in the short term, despite the confrontational rhetoric. Further development of the situation will depend on how Ukraine and its allied West countries will react to the new status of the LDPR (""the Lugansk"" and ""the Donetsk""), recognized by Russia. A return to Minsk II looks very unlikely in the near future.Global Times: How much will Russia be affected by the new round of sanctions announced by the West? What pressure will the West continue to exert on Russia over the current tension?Bochkov: For now, it is not clear which exact measures are to be enacted. But, obviously, the economic pressure is going to be excessive targeting of top officials, and individuals and entities involved in the process of recognizing both Donbas regions. On Monday, the Russia stock market witnessed the sharpest downfall since 2008 and it seems to be not the worst disturbance that could threaten the Russia economy in the midterm. The US promised to impose a whole set of severe economic sanctions targeting Russia's foreign trade, energy sector and international banking transactions. Though the impact will largely depend on the exact measures, one might be sure that they are going to loom large over the Russia economy in the years to come.?Biryukov: West sanctions against Russia will be introduced step by step and proportionally, depending on the development of the situation around the LDPR and Ukraine.

15,"50 years after Nixon's historic visit, China to be more connected with world 'but US could be more isolated'",Yang Sheng,2022-02-21,"
Monday marks the 50th anniversary of former US president Richard Nixon's icebreaking historic visit to China, which kicked off the normalization process of the China-US ties and laid the foundation of the formal establishment of bilateral diplomatic ties in 1979. However, on this day, the atmosphere in China and the US is very different.China has delivered its idea of ""one world, one family"" to show its sincerity in being and remaining  open and inclusive, as well as its determination to be and remain more connected with the world through a remarkable Winter Olympic Games. But the US, or at least its mainstream media outlets and some political elites, are questioning Nixon's decision to engage China, as they feel anxious about their unsuccessful strategy to compete with and contain China, with some of them trying to be as negative as possible in evaluating Beijing 2022, and many of them more interested in hyping concerns over war and the Ukraine crisis in continental EU. China and the US have stepped on different paths since they formally engaged with each other, said China analysts. In the past five decades, China has always sought to develop its ties with the rest of the world, and the normalization of China-US ties is a key part of this effort, and China has been empowered by the world, and also contributes significantly in handling common challenges shared by the international community. The US has greatly benefited from the normalization of China-US ties and emerged victorious in the Cold War, and has contributed a lot to the world by offering ideas, technologies and public goods, but it also refuses to stop seeking hegemony and tries to dominate the international order by force, and deals with China and Russia based on a hostile Cold War mentality.Fifty years ago, during the Cold War era, China and the US both sensed the pressures and threats from the Soviet Union, and this became a key reason behind the handshakes between the leaders from two sides of the Pacific Ocean. But today, experts said, as China and Russia continue their close ties based on shared interests and views, it seems the US is the one walking on the path toward failure, just as the Soviet Union did: posing threats to the other two great powers at the same time; being aggressive in seeking hegemony or maintaining hegemony; trying to isolate the other two but eventually finding itself becoming isolated.Wrong ideasOn the very day that marks Nixon's historic visit, China announced sanctions against two US military industrial giants - Lockheed Martin Corp and Raytheon Technologies Corp - over their arms sales to the island of Taiwan, which breaks the US promises over the Taiwan question made in the three China-US communiqués. Fifty years ago, in Shanghai on February 28, 1972, the two countries signed the Shanghai Communiqué before Nixon concluded his China visit. One of the crucial achievements of the document was the two sides reaching key agreements on the Taiwan question despite differences that had remained. The historic document ""affirmed the one-China principle, which, along with the principles of respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all states, non-aggression against other states, non-interference in the internal affairs of other states, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence, constitutes the political foundation of normalization of relations and the establishment of diplomatic ties between the two countries,"" China Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said at a routine press conference on Monday.""The US arms sales to the Taiwan region of China seriously violate the one-China principle and the stipulations of the three China-US joint communiqués, especially the August 17 Communiqué,"" Wang said.Wang also said on the 50th anniversary of Nixon's visit, ""The root cause of the current problems in China-US relations is that some people in the US, based on a seriously misguided perception of China, regard China as a major strategic competitor or even an 'imaginary enemy' and want to contain China in all dimensions.""A Beijing-based expert on international relations who asked for anonymity said that if some US believe that Nixon and Henry Kissinger were wrong ""to open the door to China because it gave China the chance to challenge US hegemony"" or the US got nothing good out of it, then ""they are dead wrong.""The normalization of China-US ties and the ""semi-alliance relationship"" that the two sides were believed to have established from 1979 to 1989 played a decisive role in ending the Cold War, and without having cooperation with China, the US wouldn't have been able to end the Cold War in that way, and wouldn't have been able to open such a huge market for US companies to earn huge profits, while in 2008, China also saved the US from the financial crisis by purchasing huge amounts of US bonds, he said. ""How could some US say the engagement policy only benefits China? They don't have gratitude and fail to keep promises, but are becoming more and more hostile, and they break promises and keep provoking US on core interests like Xinjiang, Hong Kong and Taiwan, and launched wars in the fields of trade, science and technologies, as well as media. If they still don't know who should be blamed for the worsening bilateral ties, they are pretending to be blind,"" the expert noted. Lü Xiang, an expert on US studies with the China Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times on Monday that the US strategy is to prevent a great power from emerging in the Euro-Asia continent, so US strategists are still driven by such a mind-set, and those who believed it was correct for the US to engage with China 50 years ago may also support the idea of containing China today, because for these people, it's always about maintaining US hegemony, not stable and friendly ties with China. Unlike their US counterparts, China scholars are being honest by saying that China has benefited greatly from its ties with the US. Zhang Jiadong, a professor at the Center for US Studies, Fudan University, told the Global Times on Monday that ""without Nixon's visit and the change in the US' China policy, China's reform and opening-up would have been unimaginable. At that time, without healthy China-US ties, the attempt at reform and opening-up would have been groundless and meaningless.""But today, ""The US is no longer the path that China must pass through to connect itself with the world. Although China sincerely wants to repair ties with the US and continue making efforts to bring bilateral ties back on track, it's impossible for China to abandon its principles, core interests and development rights just to maintain  'good' ties with the US. So even if the US refuses to normalize the relationship, that's fine. China can keep marching on, and this won't stop China from deepening and expanding its connections with the rest of the whole world,"" Lü said.Normalization again?There have always been some rational voices in the West, even under the current extremely tense atmosphere, as some US have sensed that without China-US cooperation, there are many challenges today that they are unlikely to solve on their own, and the danger of a China-US conflict would be unimaginable. Jeffrey D. Sachs, director of the Center for Sustainable Development at Columbia University, told the Global Times on Monday that ""We [China and the US] should be restoring the spirit of cooperation.  That is hugely important for both countries and for the whole world, especially when we face so many shared challenges, such as the pandemic, climate change, pollution, loss of biodiversity, and persistent poverty in a world of wealth.""""The difficulties lie in the misunderstandings between the two societies.  The US public and political leadership understand remarkably little about China's great history and civilization.  This is a real loss.  The US attitude is also filled with arrogance, based on the idea that the US needs to be preeminent.  We don't need dominance by any one country, but rather cooperation,"" he said. Vince Cable, former business and industry minister of the UK, said during a recent debate at Oxford University on the ties between the West and China that the US needs to get used to a world in which it is no longer No.1 and respect China's development to surpass US to become the biggest economy. ""China has become a global and authoritative power. The US has lost not only its former authority and influence in the world, but also a sense of responsibility for the fate of mankind,"" Victor Larin, an academician and principal researcher at the Russia Academy of Sciences, told the Global Times.Wang Wenbin, the China Foreign Ministry spokesperson, said that ""an important inspiration from the Shanghai Communiqué and the 50th anniversary of president Nixon's visit to China is that countries with different social systems and development paths can expand common interests and coexist peacefully as long as they adhere to mutual respect and seek common ground while shelving differences and pursue win-win cooperation.""""We hope that the US side will work with China to draw experience and wisdom from the past 50 years, carry forward the spirit of the Shanghai Communiqué and bring China-US relations back onto the track of sound and steady development,"" Wang noted.Lü said, ""We believe one day that China-US ties will be normalized again. By that time, the US will eventually accept a world order that is not dominated by US. But we hope this process will be peaceful. We need to stay alert to the fact that the decline of US hegemony could bring chaos and wars.""",CHINA,DIPLOMACY,An exhibition on US President Richard Nixon's visit to China Photo: cnsphoto,"Reporter, Beijing","Yang Sheng is a chief reporter at the Global Times covering Chinese politics, diplomacy and military.","{'US': ('LOC', 11), 'China': ('LOC', 16), 'Beijing': ('LOC', 1), 'Ukraine': ('LOC', 1), 'Russia': ('LOC', 2), 'Soviet Union': ('LOC', 1), 'Pacific': ('LOC', 1), 'Richard Nixon': ('PER', 3), 'Winter Olympic Games': ('MISC', 1), 'Cold War': ('MISC', 3), 'Soviet': ('MISC', 1), 'EU': ('ORG', 1), 'Ocean': ('ORG', 1), 'UnionO': ('ORG', 1), 'Lockheed Martin Corp': ('ORG', 1), 'Raytheon Technologies': ('ORG', 1)}"
16,Beijing 2022 a prism that refracts sour grapes in US media,Global Times,2022-02-22,"Despite unprecedented challenges, China put on truly exceptional Winter Olympic Games, but the success of the Games also became a prism that refracts jealousy, desperation, and sour grapes on different levels among West media outlets, especially those of the US. Liberal US outlets, as always, tend to put on a decent face while functioning as a propaganda tool to target China, with their ideological and so-called politically correct language. For a long time, they badmouthed China for its sports system during every Winter Olympic Games. But this time, they might have been stunned to witness how China athletes enjoy the Games. So some decided to pick far-fetched angles.The New York Times published an article on Sunday entitled, ""With Olympics Closing Ceremony, China Celebrates a Joyless Triumph,"" arguing that Beijing 2022 was ""constricted by a global health disaster, fraught with geopolitical tensions, tainted once again by accusations of doping and overshadowed by the crisis in Ukraine."" It was joyless for the NYT for sure, as it failed to discredit the Games and can only pull such silly talk. The comments only embarrass itself. It basically said that China should be shamed because the Games were constricted by a global health disaster the West failed to rein in, fraught with geopolitical tensions incited by West voices. The doping sample was collected last year before the Winter Olympic Games. And the Games were overshadowed by the crisis in Ukraine, the flames of which were fanned by the West. Other US media outlets, including CNN and US Post, are repeating their long outdated rhetoric about so-called human rights. They hesitantly and partly acknowledged that Beijing 2022 was a success to China, but emphasized that to the outside world, it is showing an image which is ""ready to defy and challenge its critics.""These media criticize China over Xinjiang affairs with their self-made lies. Yet with the Winter Olympic Games, those who actually listen to and believe the lies are decreasing. Only some politicians in US and a few media outlets are mumbling about it to themselves. Meanwhile, the conservatives, who are eager to regain power and influence in the US, are going radical. The lowest level goes to a handful of US elites such as Fox News host Will Cain, who called the Olympic sensation Eileen Gu ""an ungrateful traitor"" earlier this month, and Bill Maher, a US television host, who dropped the s-bomb on his show Friday, cursing China as a ""sh*t-hole superpower"" while attacking Gu for competing for China.Comments like these show they get increasingly jealous and scared for the rising influence of China, and for losing control of the real world. Whether they admit it or not, or how much noise they have made to stir trouble for the Games, they can't ruin the beauty of Beijing 2022. China not only successfully hosted the event against the backdrop of a pandemic, but also proved its epidemic prevention and control measures work well, and proved it is a responsible power that honors its words. Can anti-China US media outlets and elites proudly say their own country could do the same? When US media make a fuss that US TV audience for the Games dropped this time, it only shows that West audiences are losing interest in watching the ideological content, which their traditional media outlets squeezed in sports. It also proves the smearing China is becoming increasingly unpopular, Shen Yi, a professor at the School of International Relations and Public Affairs of Fudan University, told Global Times. US TV network ratings had dived long before Beijing 2022, and Donald Trump mocked the trend in March 2019 as ""fake news never wins.""The real side of the Games was told by US skier Aaron Blunck, who said China has ""done a stellar job"" yet US media have no courage to spread the voice. It is also mirrored when athletes from all over the world jumped up and down happily during the closing ceremony, hugged each other with joy in numerous scenes. So those media are disappointed. When China is striding forward on ""together for a shared future,"" some US elites and media outlets are left with embarrassment, disappointment and a big blow to self-confidence.",OPINION,OBSERVER,Photo: Li Hao/GT,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'China': ('LOC', 8), 'US': ('LOC', 6), 'Beijing': ('LOC', 2), 'Ukraine': ('LOC', 2), 'Winter Olympic Games': ('MISC', 10), 'West': ('MISC', 4), 'Olympics Closing': ('MISC', 1), '2022': ('MISC', 2), 'The New York Times': ('ORG', 1), 'NYT': ('ORG', 1), 'CNN': ('ORG', 1), 'US Post': ('ORG', 1), 'Xi': ('PER', 1), 'Fox': ('PER', 1), 'Cain': ('PER', 1), 'Eileen': ('PER', 1), 'Bill': ('PER', 1)}"

The picture of their hug also appeared in the short video played at the closing ceremony of the Winter Olympic Games. Burov told the Global Times on Monday why he hugged Abramenko. ""Because we are friends. I warmly congratulated him on his Olympic medal.

""We write to each other and call each other,"" he said.The Russia athlete noted that they have known each other for many years.""We got to know each other when we started freestyle skiing. We all got acquainted... and to this day, we still have this brotherly friendship among brotherly peoples. We are always in friendship and support each other,"" he said.This hug touched many hearts in China as the hashtag ""The hug between Russia and Ukraine athletes"" earned over 150 million views, with many hoping this hug is a signal of peace, as relations between Russia and Ukraine are currently tense.The Moscow Times reported in January that Ukraine's sports minister said Ukraine athletes should avoid standing next to their Russia counterparts at the 2022 ­Beijing Olympics.""There is a political point of view, saying what we did was wrong,"" Burov mentioned, noting that the Olympics are not about politics. ""The Olympics are, first and foremost, about sports. There should be no politics. It is always nice to have support from the Olympics and sports... It is very pleasant, of course, that we were caught on camera showing mutual support and friendship between peoples.""Burov's younger brother, Maxim, is also a freestyle skier who competed during the Beijing Games. ""It is great to come to the Games with your family.

23,"Chinese Foreign Minister calls on all parties on Ukraine issue to remain restrained, resolving disputes through peaceful means",Global Times,2022-02-22," China is concerned about the evolution of the situation in Ukraine and China's position on the Ukraine issue is consistent, China State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi told US Secretary of State Antony Blinken in a phone call upon request on Tuesday. The legitimate security concerns of any country should be respected, and the purposes and principles of the UN Charter should be upheld, Wang said. Wang said the evolution of the Ukraine issue so far is closely related to the delay in the effective implementation of the new Minsk agreement. China will continue to make contacts with all parties concerned based on the merits of the matter. ""China once again calls on all parties to exercise restraint, recognize the importance of implementing the indivisible security principle, ease the situation and resolve differences through dialogue and negotiation,"" the senior China diplomat said. The current situation in Ukraine was caught at the global spotlight after Russia President Vladimir Putin on Monday signed two decrees recognizing ""the Lugansk (LPR)"" and ""the Donetsk (DPR)"" as independent and sovereign states.China Ambassador to UN Zhang Jun also called on all parties relevant on the Ukraine situation to continue dialogue and consultation and seek reasonable solutions to address each other's concerns on the basis of equality and mutual respect at an emergency UN meeting on the Ukraine situation. During the phone call, Wang also urged the US side to fulfill a series of promises that US President Joe Biden has made and avoid sending wrong signals on containing China by its new version of the Indo-Pacific Strategy and by its provocations on the Taiwan question. The phone call was made on the heels of the 50th anniversary of former US president Richard Nixon's icebreaking historic visit to China, which kicked off the normalization process of China-US ties and laid the foundation for the formal establishment of bilateral diplomatic ties in 1979.However, China-US bilateral relations have been facing growing difficulties and the overall atmosphere has changed drastically. Recently, the US-launched new version of Indo-Pacific Strategy openly listed China as the primary region that brings challenges, and it attempted to include the strategy of containing China through the island of Taiwan into US regional strategy, which clearly sent wrong signals in terms of China containment, Wang said. There is competition and cooperation between China and the US. We cannot simply use competition to define bilateral relations, the senior China diplomat noted. Some US officials have advocated a long-term and fierce competition with China, which is likely to evolve into a full-scale confrontation between the two countries. ""China once again urges the US to take concrete actions to reflect on the series of commitments made by President Joe Biden,"" Wang said. On the very day that marks Nixon's historic visit, China announced sanctions against two US military industrial giants -- Lockheed Martin Corp and Raytheon Technologies Corp -- over their arms sales to the island of Taiwan. Arms sales to Taiwan broke US promises over the Taiwan question made in the three China-US communiqués.In a few days, it will be the 50th anniversary of the publication of the ""Shanghai Communiqué,"" and its spirit still has strong practical significance for today's China-US relations, Wang told Antony Blinken. China hopes the US side will review the original intention of the ice-breaking moment of China and the US, return to a rational and pragmatic understanding of China, and jointly push China-US relations back on the right track of sound and stable development, Wang noted. Antony Blinken said that as President Joe Biden has said many times, the US does not seek to engage in a new cold war, change China's system and back ""Taiwan independence,"" and has no intention of confrontation with China, according to a statement seen on the website of the China Foreign Ministry. The phone call between China and US foreign ministers came after the closing ceremony of the Beijing Winter Olympic Games (some US officials had hyped the so-called diplomatic boycott of the event). However, Antony Blinken congratulated the success of the Beijing Winter Olympic Games at the beginning of the phone call, as well as the great achievements China athletes had made, read the Foreign Ministry statement. Wang also congratulated the US athletes for their good results in the Games and said that the China and US athletes have had friendly interactions, mutual encouragement and common improvement, which fully embodies the Olympic spirit.",CHINA,DIPLOMACY,Wang Yi File Photo,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'China': ('LOC', 17), 'Ukraine': ('LOC', 6), 'US': ('LOC', 10), 'Minsk': ('LOC', 1), 'Russia': ('LOC', 1), 'Lugansk': ('LOC', 1), 'Donetsk': ('LOC', 1), 'DPR': ('LOC', 1), 'Taiwan': ('LOC', 2), 'Pacific': ('LOC', 1), 'Wang Yi': ('PER', 5), 'Antony Blinken': ('PER', 1), 'Vladimir Putin': ('PER', 1), 'Zhang Jun': ('PER', 1), 'Joe Biden': ('PER', 1), 'Richard Nixon': ('PER', 1), 'UN': ('ORG', 3), 'LPR': ('ORG', 1), 'Charter': ('MISC', 1), 'Indo - Pacific Strategy': ('MISC', 3)}"

30,Russia can withstand Western sanctions after years of preparation: Chinese analysts,GT staff reporters,2022-02-22," Russia has strong capacity and resilience to withstand US and EU sanctions, as its economy - which has been buffering the impact of sanctions for years - is not outward-looking, and it has been diversifying its energy exports from EU, a process that won't encounter difficulties amid global energy shortages, China analysts said on Tuesday, as tensions are running high between Russia and Ukraine and the West. But they also suggested that Russia needs to prepare for being cut off from SWIFT, which has been described as a ""nuclear option"" in sanctions packages that could deprive it of 40 percent of its revenue from energy exports and have long-term repercussions on its economy, even though the likelihood of such a move is extremely slim.After Russia President Vladimir Putin on Monday signed two decrees recognizing ""the Lugansk (LPR)"" and ""the Donetsk (DPR)"" as independent and sovereign states, the US and EU announced immediate sanctions against Russia.  US President Joe Biden issued an executive order on Monday to ""prohibit new investment, trade, and financing by US persons to, from, or in the so-called DNR and LNR regions of Ukraine."" The EU's top officials said the bloc will impose more sanctions against those involved in the recognition of LPR and DPR.This marks the first wave of sanctions against Russia from the West after tensions between Russia and Ukraine flared for months. Joe Biden has pledged that Russia will face ""swift, severe and unified"" consequences from the US and its allies. Germany, UK, Canada, and Japan soon followed the sanctions. Japan will ban the issuance of Russia bonds in the country and will freeze the assets of selected Russia individuals, Japan Prime Minister Fumio Kishida said on Wednesday.UK announced plans to target Russia elites and banks, while Germany put the brakes on a major gas pipeline project from Russia, the new Nord Stream 2 pipeline. Canada will prohibit Canadians from buying Russia sovereign bonds, Canada Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced on Tuesday. The sanctions sent global stocks and the ruble tumbling. The Russia RTS index, which tracks the 50 top Russia stocks in US dollar terms on the Moscow Stock Exchange, was up 1.59 percent on Tuesday after Russia's central bank said ""it was ready to take all necessary measures to support financial stability,"" recovering from a precipitous 17 percent fall on Monday. China observers said that the sanctions so far are more symbolic than anything likely to inflict substantial harm on the local economy, and capital market moves reflect transitory investor nervousness.""The first batch of sanctions is not targeted at either specific industries or the core of the Russia economy, so the impact is minimal,"" Cui Hongjian, director of the Department of EU Studies at the China Institute of International Studies, told the Global Times on Tuesday. Cui said that the follow-up measures, if they will be taken as threatened, could be more concrete and wide-ranging, involving energy, finance and military dimensions.The Joe Biden administration has proposed expanding a new technology export ban and cutting off Russia companies' access to dollars, Reuters reported. On Sunday, EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen warned that Russia would ""in principle be cut off from the international financial markets"" and denied access to major exporting goods if it ""attacks Ukraine."" In several interviews, von der Leyen also hinted at the possibility of imposing sanctions on Russia gas giant Gazprom and targeted the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline connecting Russia to Germany. EU imports around 40 percent of its gas supply from Gazprom and Russia is one of the world's largest oil and natural gas producers.Global oil prices rose on fears that the Ukraine situation would disrupt global supplies. The price of benchmark Brent crude reached a seven-year high of $97.76 a barrel on Tuesday.Observers said it would be a mission impossible for EU to shed its overreliance on Russia's natural gas, considering the persisting global shortage. Such ability also depends on the extent to which the US is able to replace Russia's natural gas exports, Cui said. Russia has been making diversification efforts to explore alternative markets. For example, Russia used to mainly export products to EU, but now its exports to China, like oil and natural gas, are also rising in scale.In February, China National Petroleum Corp (CNPC) and Russia's Gazprom signed an agreement on the purchase and sale of gas from the Russia Far East, and under the agreement, Russia will increase gas exports to China to 48 billion cubic meters (bcm) per year.Cui said that the US' potential new tech export ban may restrict the supply of raw materials and equipment to Russia's military, aerospace and energy sectors. ""But the West has blacklisted Russia military and high-tech enterprises since 2014. So it remains unclear that the US could leverage its embargo to heap pressure on Russia,"" Li Jianmin, a research fellow at the China Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times. As to whether the US will play the ace card of removing Russia from the SWIFT system, which has serious implications for its foreign trade, Cui said that ""the West is deeply divided"" on this issue due to EU's immense trade volume with Russia, partly driven by energy.Li said that Russia has long been taking steps against such a possible move, including avoiding the US dollar in some trade settlements, and clearing US debts and its foreign reserves. Russia has developed an alternative messaging system called SPFS since 2014, which now reportedly handles about one-fifth of its domestic payments.""Russia has been running pressure tests of how its economy would run in extreme cases, which must have included being cut off from links to the outside. But even in such a case, Russia is able to secure its own supplies as it has a large territory and ample resources,"" Li explained. Cui agreed, noting that Russia's reliance on the external market is ""limited"" except for the energy and military sectors, which speaks volume to its ability to offset the fallout of West sanctions. China State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi on Tuesday called on all parties on the Ukraine issue to remain restrained and resolve disputes through peaceful means.In 2021, Russia's GDP grew 4.7 percent, the fastest in more than a decade, due to a surge in oil prices and consumption expenditures.",SOURCE,ECONOMY,"Photo taken on Jan. 26, 2022 shows the snow-covered Kremlin and Saint Basil's Cathedral in Moscow, Russia.Photo:Xinhua",Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'Russia': ('LOC', 16), 'US': ('LOC', 6), 'China': ('LOC', 2), 'Ukraine': ('LOC', 3), 'West': ('LOC', 2), 'Lugansk': ('LOC', 1), 'LPR': ('LOC', 2), 'Donetsk': ('LOC', 1), 'DPR': ('LOC', 2), 'DNR': ('LOC', 1), 'Germany': ('LOC', 2), 'UK': ('LOC', 2), 'Canada': ('LOC', 3), 'Japan': ('LOC', 3), 'Moscow': ('LOC', 1), 'EU': ('ORG', 4), 'LNR': ('ORG', 1), 'Exchange': ('ORG', 1), 'SWI': ('MISC', 1), 'Canadians': ('MISC', 1), 'Vladimir Putin': ('PER', 1), 'Joe Biden': ('PER', 2), 'Fumio Kishida': ('PER', 1), 'Justin': ('PER', 1)}"
31,"How US media, liberal or conservative, turn Beijing Winter Olympics into another feather in their anti-China campaign cap",GT staff reporters,2022-02-22,"The Winter Olympic Games successfully closed on Sunday. The sports event, ""truly exceptional"" as International Olympic Committee President Thomas Bach described at Sunday's closing ceremony, showed the world not only the excellent performances of Olympians, but also how China overcame challenges to offer the participants high-quality facilities and services amid the global COVID-19 pandemic.Nonetheless, observers said it's sad that many foreign audiences, who usually receive information from some biased West media outlets, the US media in particular, hardly knew about the Beijing Winter Olympic Games in an authentic and objective way.How did some influential US media outlets cover the Winter Olympic Games, when the US sees China as a strategic rival? The Global Times selected six US media outlets that represent different interest groups in the country, and collected and analyzed their recent coverage related to the Beijing Winter Olympic Games, trying to learn about the US media's strategy concerning the Games and the possible prejudice behind it.The selected six media outlets were CNN, The New York Times (NYT), Wall Street Journal (WSJ), Fox News, National Public Radio (NPR), and USA Today.

Media's 'China agenda' of Beijing OlympicsBy using online media monitoring tools, the Global Times reporters collected media coverage related to the Beijing Winter Olympic Games in February, particularly the week of February 14-21, focusing on coverage from CNN, NYT, WSJ, Fox News, NPR, and USA Today.These six major media outlets presented a very mixed tone in their discourse of the closing ceremony of the Winter Olympic Games on Monday night.In the titles of articles published by these US media outlets, most of the pieces included negative adjectives such as ""rocky"", ""strange"", ""unwelcomed"", ""controversial"", and ""overshadowed by a doping scandal"" in describing the Games, the Global Times reporters found. There were a lot references to alleged ""human rights violations"" and ""excessively strict quarantine policies"" in their review, though some articles provided a relatively objective picture of the well-designed and touching details of the closing ceremony.The sour grapes mentality exhibited by US media is on full display in these articles. NPR, for instance, even preposterously tagged the Games as ""the most controversial, most unwelcoming Olympics of our lifetime"" in an opinion piece by its staff.https://money.yahoo.com/most-controversial-most-unwelcoming-olympics-150319010.htmlUS politics and media observers tend to classify CNN and NYT as the liberal media (or ""left-wing""), WSJ and Fox as conservative media (or ""right-wing""), while NPR and USA Today as relatively moderate media (or ""center""). US media outlets with different editorial objectives speak for different groups in the US, while they usually stand together against other countries for US national interests.Looking back the past week, CNN, a typical ""left-wing"" media outlet known for its mostly liberal views, published some 73 articles covering the Beijing Winter Olympic Games from February 14 to 21. Fourteen of the articles were related to China or China athletes, found he Global Times.Among the 14 articles, four were positive overall, covering the performances of China gold medalists such as figure skaters Sui Wenjing and Han Cong. Three of the 14 articles were written in negative tones, which made far-fetched links between the sporting event and China's relationship with other countries. In a February COVID-19 article reporting on a ""doping scandal"" about Russia skater Kamila Valieva, CNN frequently mentioned Ukraine's ""border tension"" and the ""close ties"" between China and Russia. The NYT is another mainstream media publication popular among US liberalists. The Global Times found that between February 14 and 21, it produced about 211 pieces covering the Beijing Winter Olympic Games, 30 pieces of which are related to China and China athletes.The NYT reported on the Games with much broader views than CNN did. Among the 30 pieces, 12 were positive overall and covered not only China gold medalists, but also the various cuisines provided at the Olympic Village, and China's speed trains near the Village.However, in its six pieces written in a negative tone, the NYT seemed to make bigger efforts in smearing China with strange, baseless accusations. In a February COVID-19 article reporting on a ""doping scandal"" about Russia skater Kamila Valieva, CNN frequently mentioned Ukraine's ""border tension"" and the ""close ties"" between China and Russia, trying to hint at China being behind the Ukraine crisis. That was neither true nor related to the Winter Olympic Games in the slightest, noted China international relations and media experts.The WSJ, a center-right US-based media publication, published 28 reports on the Winter Olympic Games between February 14 and February 21, 13 pieces of which are related to China and China athletes.Only two of the reports were relatively positive, focusing on Gu and China's record-breaking gold medal haul.Five had negative tones, involving claims of China's ""data surveillance of athletes"" and ""dismal ratings for the Winter Olympic Games"" that were patently untrue or have been repeatedly refuted.FOX, a typical right-wing media outlet in the US, ran about 143 stories between February 14 and February 21, 31 of which were closely related to China athletes or China.FOX reported on international athletes' positive comments about the Winter Olympic Games, including praise for the quality of the ice rink in Beijing's Olympic Village, the efficient closed-loop quarantine measures, the popular China food in the Village, high-tech elements, and stories of China athletes' valiant efforts.

Photo: Cui Meng/GTHowever, some of the articles forcefully conflated the Games with unrelated political issues such as the situation in the island of Taiwan and alleged ""human rights concerns"" in Xinjiang, despite repeated calls from mainstream international voices to avoid politicizing the Games.In a piece titled ""Beijing Olympics get political with Taiwan, Uyghur questions"", FOX repeatedly peppered the piece with political issues, and hyped the question ""if IOC uniforms and other IOC garments were produced by Uygur labor - or from Xinjiang cotton.""Being regarded as a centrist media outlet by many, NPR published some 72 articles on the Beijing Olympics between February 14 and 21, and 10 of the articles were related to the host country China, and China athletes.Of the 10 articles, only one was relatively positive, narrating the positive impact that Gu has had on more young girls participating in winter sports.The rest of the articles, while trying to maintain a relatively objective stance, included two direct attacks on China for ""politicizing the Olympics"" and ""deplorable"" restrictions imposed by the country's quarantine policies.USA TODAY, another US media among centrists, ran 105 stories about the Beijing Olympics from February 14 to 21, of which 10 were directly related to China athletes or the organizers.Three of the articles were the relatively neutral coverage of the performance of China athletes on the field. One article on February 18, however, was written in a biased and negative tone, intentionally quoting an individual athlete as saying the Beijing Olympics ""terrible,"", the Global Times found.Correspondents and their predetermined perspectivesMany influential US media outlets sent correspondents to cover the Beijing Winter Olympic Games. At least 10 corresponds appear to be China US or come from an Asia background. Looking into their stories, however, most of the correspondents acted not as bridges linking China and US audience, but as barriers that deepened misunderstandings between the two.Amy Qin of the NYT, for instance, is a name familiar to many China readers. This Asia-based correspondent regularly covers China politics and society, and many of her stories have, in the past, sparked controversy laced with bias and misinformation, such a COVID-19 origins tracing piece that was published in June 2021.Qin wrote at least 12 stories during the Beijing Olympics, reporting from the opening ceremony and China athletes, to China's dynamic zero-COVID-19 policy and winter sports popularity, as shown by the NYT website. In a February COVID-19 article covering the skiing development in China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, she blatantly mentioned the ""genocide"" rumor at the end, eclipsing any bright spots regarding skiing development in the region that may have been mentioned in her article.With a cross-cultural background herself, Qin seems particularly interested in US-born athletes of China descents, and what the current China-US ""rivalry"" has done to the group. On February 16, she wrote that Nathan Chen, a China US figure skater who won gold at the Olympics, was ""ignored"" by the China public in a seeming attempt to criticize the so-called ""resurgent nationalism"" among ""[China] citizens.""US correspondents in China have been a window for US to know more about the country. Unfortunately, ""most [US correspondents in China] are actually tools to play up the negative image of China that caters to the US elites,"" Li Haidong, a professor from the Institute of International Relations of the China Foreign Affairs University, told the Global Times.Nonetheless, in the era of the great boom of social media, these correspondents and the US mainstream media, can no longer dominate China-related discourse, as social media have increasingly become a popular way for people to follow Olympic-related topics, which indeed poses a challenge to the monopoly of traditional mainstream media in depicting China, Li said.Despite the widespread ""political boycott"" against the Games played up by the US mainstream media, US are not fooled and many still genuinely enjoyed watching the Games across numerous social media platforms and shared what they are fond of or the Games' most captivating moments. That's a reality, but also a story that never gets told, Vipinder Jaswal, founder of the US-based PR company Vippi Media, told the Global Times in a previous interview.Jaswal said that the mainstream media and politicians coming against the Games have the greatest function to negatively influence people and disseminate some type of propaganda, but people were largely not fooled.Narration full of bias and liesThe collected data showed that in general, positive coverage of US media mostly focused on relatively light topics in specific sports or social areas, including China athletes winning medals, and international athletes enjoying delicious meals at the Olympic Village. Many of its negative coverage, ridiculously, had little to do with the Games. These articles were usually related to politics and economy, and clichés that alluded to ""problems"" in China that actually don't exist, such the ""Xinjiang forced labor"" accusation. Regardless of the fact that much of the fake news has been clarified by China government, US media rehashed them, lashing them to the Winter Olympic Games for eye-grabbing sensationalism. Discourse on the Games in the mainstream US media, whether liberal or conservative, has yet to get rid of the ""gloom filter"" that was projected in their typical coverage full of prejudice against China's development, observers said Although US media outlets with different editorial objectives speak for different groups in the US, they usually stand together against China for US national interests, they notedThey are still trying to use the US political elitist narrative of human rights standards as a weapon to attack the Games, Li told the Global Times.This ideology-oriented reporting approach inevitably leads to bias in the US media's reporting on China, and it ends up further away from the ""independence"" and ""transparency"" advocated by West news ethics, said Li.",CHINA,SOCIETY,The Media Center of the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympic Games Photo: VCG,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'Winter Olympic Games': ('MISC', 6), 'International Olympic Committee': ('MISC', 1), 'Olympia': ('MISC', 1), 'COVID - 19': ('MISC', 1), 'West': ('MISC', 1), 'Beijing Winter Olympic Games': ('MISC', 6), 'Beijing OlympicsB': ('MISC', 1), 'Global': ('MISC', 1), 'Olympics': ('MISC', 1), 'Thomas Bach': ('PER', 1), 'China': ('LOC', 3), 'US': ('LOC', 7), 'Global Times': ('ORG', 3), 'CNN': ('ORG', 2), 'The New York Times': ('ORG', 2), 'NYT': ('ORG', 2), 'Wall Street Journal': ('ORG', 1), 'WSJ': ('ORG', 2), 'Fox News': ('ORG', 2), 'National Public Radio': ('ORG', 1), 'NPR': ('ORG', 3), 'USA Today': ('ORG', 2)}"
32,GT Voice: Ukraine crisis likely to disrupt global energy supplies,Global Times,2022-02-22,"With the outbreak of the Ukraine crisis, EU seems to have never been closer to a self-made energy crunch which threatens its future.The US and its West allies condemned Russia's latest move to recognize the two breakaway regions in eastern Ukraine as independent states while pledging to impose new sanctions on Moscow. Russia's UN representative Vasily Nebenzya said during an emergency UN meeting held on Tuesday that Russia remains open to a diplomatic settlement to the Ukraine issue, but the US and its allies have repeatedly played up the situation, warning that West powers not to worsen the situation in Ukraine.In a Tuesday phone call with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, China State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi said the evolution of the Ukraine issue so far is closely related to the delay in the effective implementation of the new Minsk agreement. China once again calls on all related parties to exercise restraint, ease the tense standoff and resolve differences through peaceful negotiation.The latest development unsurprisingly sent jitters throug global financial markets, with a litany of international stock indexes plunging sharply and oil prices surging on potential energy supply disruption concerns. This is because if the Russia-Ukraine situation continues to escalate, it could cause a severe turmoil in global energy supplies, with EU countries bearing the brunt of the shocks.EU officials previously said that there is general agreement that economic sanctions would be ready within 48 hours of an ""invasion"". While it remains unclear what the EU sanctions will contain, given Russia's economic significance to EU in terms of energy cooperation, there are loud voices calling for EU sanctions to avoid disrupting important oil supplies from Russia. For instance, Italy Prime Minister Mario Draghi told reporters last week that any sanctions that may be imposed on Russia by the EU should not hit energy imports. His remarks, to a certain extent, underscore EU countries' dependence on Russia for supply of energy.Therefore, any potential West sanctioning on Russia's energy exports is likely to be double-edged sword. Some may argue that US gas exports to EU has been on the rise recently, which may become a potential source of energy supply to EU countries, but even if the US can increase its production capacity to fill the supply gap, the high transportation costs of LNG from the US means that the EU's energy costs will rise significantly.Similarly, oil has also been facing considerable pressure lately. Once the situation worsens, it is inevitable for oil prices to go off the roof.It is not just Russia and the EU that will be hit by the turmoil in global energy supplies caused by the geopolitical conflict. Once the global energy supply and demand pattern has to change, China, which relies heavily on oil and gas imports, could also feel the effect.Historically speaking, military conflicts, especially those among major powers, often have a serious impact on oil supplies.China should further strengthen economic and trade cooperation with Russia, Saudi Arabia and other oil exporting countries. China should also be prepared to ensure the security of its oil supplies. In the long run, the country needs to increase the use of green and renewable energies as much as possible to consistently support China's economic growth.",SOURCE,GT VOICE,oil Photo: CFP,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'Ukraine': ('LOC', 6), 'US': ('LOC', 6), 'Russia': ('LOC', 9), 'Moscow': ('LOC', 1), 'China': ('LOC', 2), 'Minsk': ('LOC', 1), 'Italy': ('LOC', 1), 'EU': ('ORG', 11), 'UN': ('ORG', 2), 'Council': ('ORG', 1), 'West': ('MISC', 3), 'Vasily Nebenzya': ('PER', 1), 'Antony Blinken': ('PER', 1), 'Wang Yi': ('PER', 1), 'Mario Draghi': ('PER', 1)}"
33,"China handles complex Ukraine crisis with caution, principle",Yang Sheng,2022-02-22,"The Ukraine crisis sees new change as Russia has decided to recognize two regions in eastern Ukraine as ""independent and sovereign states,"" and the UN has met on the issue, with China calling on all parties to continue dialogue and consultations and seek reasonable solutions.The situation shows that Russia has seen through the weakness of the West led by the US and decided to take more direct actions to push the US and NATO to respond to its security concerns, and by recognizing the two regions as sovereign states, Russia forces would be able to enter the regions openly. The UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called for the peaceful settlement of the conflict in eastern Ukraine, in accordance with the Minsk Agreements, as endorsed by the UN in resolution 2202 (2015). China is concerned about the development of the Ukraine issue and its position on the Ukraine issue has been consistent, China State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi told US Secretary of State Antony Blinken in a phone call upon request on Tuesday. Any country's legitimate security concerns should be respected and the purposes and principles of the UN Charter should be upheld, Wang said.All parties concerned should continue dialogue and consultation, and seek reasonable solutions to address each other's concerns on the basis of equality and mutual respect, China Ambassador to the UN Zhang Jun said at the UN meeting on Tuesday. Zhang underlined that the current situation in Ukraine ""is a result of many complex factors. China always makes its own position according to the merits of the matter itself. We believe that all countries should solve international disputes by peaceful means in line with the purposes and principles of the UN Charter.""China has close strategic ties with Russia, but whether it is about the most recent situation or the Crimea issue in the past, China has always stayed neutral and urged relevant parties to handle the situation through talks, said China experts, noting that this stance is more constructive and less harmful to the ongoing tension, as the crisis was caused by complicated reasons, including NATO's aggressive expansion that caused concrete security threats to Russia and other non-NATO countries in the region. So it would be unfair to merely blame and accuse one side. After the Cold War, Russia showed interest in joining NATO but the request was declined, and NATO promised Russia that it would not expand, but failed to keep its promise. The NATO expansion has brought heavy pressure on Russia as NATO has deployed weapons and missile defense systems in countries around Russia, and this has undermined the nuclear strategic balance in EU. More seriously, NATO launched military intervention to totally break former Yugoslavia - a sovereign country - into pieces. All of these have forced Russia to choose to take such tough actions today. So the crisis was caused by complicated reasons, said China experts. They noted that in the NATO's military action against former Yugoslavia, the China Embassy in Belgrade was bombed and three China journalists were killed, and China is now facing similar pressure from the US in the Asia-Pacific region. That's why China mainstream public opinion on NATO tends to be negative and China's stance is not the same as that of the West.

The UN holds an emergency meeting on the Ukraine crisis at its headquarters in New York on February 21, 2022. In a statement, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called for the peaceful settlement of the conflict in eastern Ukraine, in accordance with the Minsk Agreements, as endorsed by the UN in resolution 2202 (2015). Photo: VCGRussia's plan and China's stanceRussian President Vladimir Putin on Monday signed two decrees recognizing ""the Lugansk (LPR)"" and ""the Donetsk (DPR)"" as independent and sovereign states, the Xinhua News Agency reported.Cui Hongjian, director of the Department of EU Studies at the China Institute of International Studies, told the Global Times on Tuesday, ""The reason why Russia took such actions is that Vladimir Putin wants to make the US and NATO follow Russia's step in this strategic game as Russia is strongly unsatisfied with the US and NATO's negative response to Russia's security concerns about the issue of NATO expansion, and Vladimir Putin has seen through the weakness of the West.""Since the beginning of the crisis in Ukraine, the US has uttered a lot of tough words and made a series of military deployments in EU, but its political stance is very weak as US repeatedly stressed that it won't go to war with Russia on the issue, so this made Russia decide to impose a ""stress test"" on the US and the EU, to see how the West would further react, and whether Russia's security concerns would be responded to effectively, Cui noted. As Moscow asked the US and NATO for security guarantees, West countries ignored Russia's fundamental concerns and nothing has changed in their position, Vladimir Putin noted on Monday. Russia's demands to the US and NATO for security include: Ukraine should not join NATO; a limit to the deployment of troops and weapons in NATO's eastern flank, in effect returning NATO forces to where they were stationed in 1997.""The situation is getting increasingly complicated and unpredictable,"" Yang Jin, an associate research fellow at the Institute of Russia, EU and Central Asia Studies under the China Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times on Tuesday.""By recognizing the LPR and DPR, from Russia's perspective, it would be legitimate for its military forces to enter relevant regions, as these two 'states' could invite Russia troops to enter their territories for peacekeeping or other missions,"" Yang said.Vladimir Putin said on Tuesday that ""Russia has done everything to preserve the territorial integrity of Ukraine"" by fighting for the implementation of the 2015 Minsk Agreements, but all the efforts ended up in vain, according to Xinhua.  Yang said if the 2015 Minsk Agreements had been fully implemented, Russia won't be concerned that Ukraine would join NATO. But the US and other forces overtly agree but covertly oppose the Minsk Agreements to push Ukraine to join NATO or try to deploy military forces in the country. This has caused Russia's tough reactions. Cui Heng, an assistant research fellow at the Center for Russia Studies of China Normal University, said that Ukraine used to be a very prosperous country in EU, but its situation is getting increasingly difficult with a declining economy and worsening security, and even losing territories. A key reason is that Ukraine politicians have chosen the wrong strategy amid the confrontation between Russia and the West in recent years.""If the country located in the middle between Russia and the West takes side and is hostile to one side instead of being neutral, it will definitely cause tragedy,"" he noted.The China analyst said China has close strategic ties with Russia, and also has many investments and long-standing cooperation with Ukraine, so China will definitely stay neutral and keep its principles related to sovereign states' territorial integrity.Cui Hongjian said, ""We believe that the most urgent task at the moment is to urge relevant parties to talk and not to have any conflict. Second, Russia and Ukraine could actually solve the problem face to face. Third, the West, especially the US, should stop further intensifying the tension by making further military deployments and imposing more sanctions.""Most major West powers including the US, the UK, the EU, Canada, Australia and Japan have condemned Russia's latest move and claim that they will impose new sanctions against Moscow.What's next?""The situation in eastern Ukraine is undergoing major changes,"" the China Embassy in Ukraine said in a statement on its website on Tuesday.""The China Embassy in Ukraine reminds China citizens and China-funded enterprises in Ukraine to pay attention to the safety notices issued locally and not to go to unstable regions.""China experts predicted that an all-out war is still unlikely as the massive military operation will cause the situation out of control, so the conflict might focus in the specific regions rather than expand to the whole country.What the West could do is very limited, and the US prefers to increase military deterrence against Russia but this is not what the EU wants. In terms of what sanctions would be imposed on Russia, West countries will coordinate to reach a final conclusion.  China experts also predicted that the US would place more resources in EU than in the Asia-Pacific region in the future due to the changing geopolitical situation in Ukraine.At least in the next few years, the US will have to focus on EU, and the ""Indo-Pacific Strategy"" will be reduced to an empty shelf and a slogan. The US has always said that it wants strategic competition, but unexpectedly, the arena of fierce strategic competition will be in EU rather than in the Indo-Pacific, Li Haidong, a professor from the Institute of International Relations of China Foreign Affairs University, told the Global Times on Tuesday. ""If the US insists on talking about the Indo-Pacific at this juncture, doing so will mean facing another collapsing end like it had faced in Afghanistan. I don't think the US policy elites will be so stupid,"" Li said.There are voices from the West that have tried to distort China's stance on the crisis, and compare the Ukraine crisis with the Taiwan question. But China analysts said the two cases are entirely different, as Taiwan has never been a sovereign state and the Taiwan question is China's internal affairs instead of an international issue, and China's approach to promoting and realizing its national reunification has nothing to do with the Ukraine crisis.On West media linking the Ukraine crisis with the Taiwan question, China Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said at a routine press conference on Tuesday that ""it's an irrefutable historical and juridical fact that Taiwan is an inalienable part of China and the one-China principle is a recognized norm in international relations.""""The China people have staunch determination, firm will, and strong ability to defend their national sovereignty,"" Wang said.",CHINA,DIPLOMACY,"The United Nations holds an emergency meeting on the Ukraine issue at United Nations headquarters in New?

To a large extent, this is due to Russia's sense of insecurity triggered by the aftermath of the 2014 Color Revolution in Ukraine instigated by the US. NATO's eastward expansion has intensified internal conflicts in Ukraine and between the country and Russia, leading to a complicated situation. The US Democratic administrations have been deeply involved in the situation in Ukraine. President Joe Biden, acting as Vice President in 2014, also played a role in the color revolution along with almost all of the current US diplomats and security officials. The situation in 2022 is a natural extension of the 2014 Color Revolution, the consequences of which can't be quelled in a matter of months. The US is actually playing a ""EU card,"" taking the EU ""hostage"" and forcing it to stay in the transatlantic alliance. The leaders of the EU major powers have to come forward to reach an understanding with Russia. Otherwise, Russia and EU will suffer the loss.China is an outsider. It respects the complex history of the region and hope the situation does not develop into an intense US-led geopolitical conflict and catastrophe. China will support Russia's economic fundamentals from the impact of potential West sanctions. In addition, China will keep calling for a resolution of the crisis through diplomatic channels as China has always done. This has nothing to do with the Wall Street Journal's allegation that China aims to ""protect ties with the US.""EU has been in constant strife over territorial and ethnic issues for centuries, a situation that is unique and has not ceased even after the Cold War. First, the former Yugoslavia was dismembered by the US-led NATO, and now the US is using the Ukraine crisis to undermine Russia's security. Those are all problems they need to solve themselves. US politicians and media have recently been sowing discord between China and Russia. A Foreign Affairs article claimed China is a player which ""stands awkwardly."" China, on one hand, ""has taken Russia's side, blaming NATO expansion for causing the crisis,"" and on the other hand, has called for diplomacy over war in order to ""prevent relations with the US from significantly deteriorating."" The US always desires an alienated partnership between China and Russia. In fact, China and Russia leaders are clearly aware of the two countries' own problems. China has never and will never get involved in Russia's historical problems including its relations with the countries that became independent after the disintegration of the Soviet Union. The Ukraine crisis is extremely complex, and this issue needs to be solved on the basis of understanding history and reality simultaneously. If the history of the region is ignored, there can be no correct path to a solution. The US is playing a big game at minimal cost, trying to keep EU in trepidation to maintain the transatlantic alliance and its arms sales. Lockheed Martin, one of the largest US companies in military support, became the world's largest defense contractor by revenue for the fiscal year 2014, thanks to the tense situations in Ukraine. The US has complained for years about the levels of EU's defense spending because of the huge influence of US defense contractors on the government.Arguably, the US needs to take the greatest responsibility for the current tensions, and it will not be restrained unless it suffers losses to its own economy.The author is a research fellow at the China Academy of Social Sciences. opinion@globaltimes.com.cn",OPINION,ASIAN REVIEW,Illustraion: Chen Xia/GT,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'Russia': ('LOC', 11), 'Lugansk': ('LOC', 1), 'Donetsk': ('LOC', 1), 'Ukraine': ('LOC', 4), 'US': ('LOC', 11), 'China': ('LOC', 10), 'Yugoslavia': ('LOC', 1), 'Vladimir Putin': ('PER', 1), 'Joe Biden': ('PER', 1), 'LPR': ('ORG', 1), 'DPR': ('ORG', 1), 'NATO': ('ORG', 3), 'EU': ('ORG', 5), 'Wall Street Journal': ('ORG', 1), 'Color Revolution': ('MISC', 2), 'Democratic': ('MISC', 1), 'West': ('MISC', 1), 'Cold War': ('MISC', 1)}"
35,Discrediting China on Ukraine issue shows West’s diplomatic failure,Zhang Hong,2022-02-22,"As Russia-Ukraine tensions escalate, the world is paying close attention to China's stance and reaction.In general, China takes a rather neutral position on the Ukraine issue and such a position has never changed. China State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi told US Secretary of State Antony Blinken in a phone conversation on Tuesday that the legitimate security concerns of any country should be respected, and the purposes and principles of the UN (UN) Charter should be upheld.China has been advocating the resolution of differences through dialogue and consultation. The Ukraine issue is a conflict between Russia and the West as well as between Russia and Ukraine. In other words, these countries are stakeholders. There are already some multilateral mechanisms for consultation, including the UN. What China can do now is keep voicing its position at the international level and call on all parties to exercise restraint. China is willing to work actively to settle the conflict, but will only play a mediating role if it has the support and approval of all parties involved.At the same time, some in the West still question if China will fully support Russia over this issue. Some argue China is standing with Russia, while others try to drive a wedge between the two countries. For example, a recent Wall Street Journal article claims China is actually taking into account its relations with the US when dealing with Russia.This is a misinterpretation of the logic in China-Russia relations. Beijing and Moscow remain the main driving force for the development of bilateral relations, not other external factors.China and Russia are good neighbors and share a comprehensive strategic partnership of coordination. The development of relations between the two countries is driven by a series of common interests. This includes maintaining the security of the regional geopolitical environment, as well as promoting peace and development.As permanent members of the UN and great powers, China and Russia have to take responsibility while maintaining good bilateral relations. Therefore, both countries are opposed to any wrongdoing or distorted interpretations within the international order.Smearing China-Russia relations shows the West diplomacy's inaction toward Russia, or even its failure. For a long time, Russia and the West have been communicating with each other proactively. But the two sides couldn't reach a consensus on many issues. This is because the West decided to treat some of Russia's concerns with indifference, neglect, and even arrogance. It can be said that the West's diplomacy toward Russia has already failed. To help solve the problem, China, as a nation that believes in peace and dialogue, has to continue to oppose the mindset of engaging in a cold war or a zero-sum game.China supports dialogue, and it advocates the ideal of multilateralism. Neither party can wipe out the other, that peace can only be achieved through co-existence and striving for a win-win solution. This is a healthy and positive attitude. Spreading false speculation of China's stance on the Ukraine issue and souring China-Russia relations are not the right way to resolve the crisis.Discrediting China will not fortify global mutual trust, communication, or unity. This is quite dangerous especially now, as we are on the edge of war and security crises. At this time, all parties should, first of all, engage in dialogue. Throwing mud at China will not defuse the crisis in Ukraine.It is also unrealistic to undermine relations between Beijing and Moscow. A saying goes, ""You can change friends, not neighbors."" China and Russia as neighboring countries have to get along, so do Russia and Ukraine. China-Russia relations are often called ""a model of coordination between countries in the 21st century."" This indicates that neither China nor Russia thinks only about their own interests when dealing with bilateral and multilateral issues. The two countries are willing to meet each other half way for a win-win situation.The author is an associate research fellow at the Institute of Russia, EU & Central Asia Studies of the China Academy of Social Sciences. opinion@globaltimes.com.cn",OPINION,ASIAN REVIEW,"Permanent Representative of China to the United Nations, Zhang Jun, speaks during a meeting of the United Nations Security Council at the 76th UN General Assembly on September 23, 2021 in New York.

China netizens were fascinated and said they couldn't believe Weibo has become a platform of court hearings for international affairs. The Ukraine Embassy to China said in a statement on Weibo that Ukraine condemns Russia's recognition of the independence of the LPR and DPR, calling it a serious violation of the UN Charter and Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity within its internationally recognized borders.The statement said the decision ""will not produce any legal effects, and it has sharply escalated the situation and can mean Russia unilateral withdrawal from the Minsk agreements. … Taking into account all risks, we do not give in to provocations and will continue to work on the political and diplomatic settlement of the Russia-Ukraine armed conflict.""""Therefore, we insist on tough sanctions against Russia to send a clear signal that no further escalation of the situation will be allowed. It is time to act to end Russia aggression and restore peace and stability in EU,"" the statement said. 

Photo: screenshot of the Weibo account of Russia Embassy to China Following Ukraine's statement, the embassy of Russia in China posted that Russia President Vladimir Putin has signed the Executive Orders on the Recognition of ""DPR"" and ""LPR,"" and inked Treaties of Friendship, Cooperation and Mutual Assistance between Russia and the two parties. It also shared Russia's Permanent Representative to the UN Vasily Nebenzya's statement at the UN on Tuesday, who said, ""I remind that by the moment the Minsk Agreements were signed, the LPR and DPR had already proclaimed independence. The fact that Russia recognized this independence today makes no changes to the list of sides to the Minsk Agreements, because Russia is not a side thereto."" Nebenzya added that ""Another point is that Ukraine, under the West patronage, has long been openly sabotaging the Minsk Agreements that were supposed to start being implemented back in 2015.""Following the announcements, a number of embassies of EU countries in China, including France and the UK, also issued statements on Weibo calling for emergency meeting of the UN and the sanctions and reactions toward Russia. The ''Ukraine issue'' became a hot topic on Weibo on Tuesday, with some 900 million views and prompting nearly 200,000 discussions. ""Another chess piece played by the US. It's pathetic,"" commented a netizen under the post of the Ukraine Embassy to China. Others joked that ""the Ukraine war has been moved online because of the pandemic, and please forgive for any inconveniences.""China Foreign Ministry on Tuesday called on all parties on the Ukraine issue to remain calm, ease tensions and resolve differences through dialogue and negotiation.Global Times",CHINA,POLITICS,Photo: screenshot of the Weibo account of Ukraine Embassy to China,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'Russia': ('LOC', 14), 'Lugansk': ('LOC', 1), 'Donetsk': ('LOC', 1), 'Ukraine': ('LOC', 8), 'China': ('LOC', 7), 'France': ('LOC', 1), 'UK': ('LOC', 1), 'Minsk': ('LOC', 4), 'West': ('LOC', 1), 'LPR': ('ORG', 4), 'DPR': ('ORG', 4), 'Sina Weibo': ('ORG', 1), 'UN': ('ORG', 3), 'EU': ('ORG', 1), 'N': ('ORG', 1), 'Wei': ('MISC', 3), 'Charter': ('MISC', 1), 'Orders': ('MISC', 1), 'Treaties of Friendship, Cooperation and Mutual Assistance': ('MISC', 1), 'Agreement': ('MISC', 3), 'Vladimir Putin': ('PER', 1), 'Vasily N': ('PER', 1)}"
37,Japan fans China-Aussie flame to seek advantage,Global Times,2022-02-22,"When it turns out that Australia is staging a self-directed farce with its ""laser attack"" allegation against China, Japan has chosen to stand on the erroneous side of the incident.According to Australia media, Japan's Ambassador to Australia Yamagami Shingo openly backed Australia in its latest confrontation with China and said his country was ""fully behind Australia on this matter."" The remarks came even after China refuted Australia's hype that a China People's Liberation Army Navy vessel pointed a laser at its patrol aircraft and revealed the fact that the Australia patrol aircraft operated near the China vessel flotilla with a minimal distance of only 4 kilometers and dropped sonobuoys around China ships. It was only after Australia made these provocations that China carried out safe, standard and professional actions.With the Japan envoy offering one of the first public expressions of support to Australia since the incident, Japan has chosen geopolitics over truth and justice. Da Zhigang, director of the Institute of Northeast Asia Studies at Heilongjiang Provincial Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times that Japan wants to tag China as the provocateur of the ""laser attack"" incident as a way to smear China.""The Japan ambassador is sending a message to the international community that China exacerbated regional tension first. By doing so, Japan aims to inject firmness to Australia's anti-China crusade and pour oil on the China-Australia flame. This is exacerbating regional tension,"" said Da.This time, a Japan diplomat voiced Japan's support even ahead of his US counterpart. Da believes that either it is because the US didn't think the incident was relevant to its own interests, or that the US is too busy grappling with what's happening in Ukraine. But since Japan acts as a microphone of the US on many occasions, Japan's stance reflects that of the US. Japan's intention to smear China and stir up regional tension fits perfectly into the US' Indo-Pacific playbook. As vanguards of the US' China containment strategy, Japan and Australia have moved closer in recent years. Both have taken part in the same multilateral military exercises, are members of the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue, and have become quasi-allies after signing the Reciprocal Access Agreement in January. The subtext of all these crafty maneuvers is: China. The so-called circle of values comprising these ""like-minded"" countries is nothing but a gang of interests. The words of Shingo reflect a hawkish, bellicose and containment mentality. This is not the first time that he rushes to the fore. In March last year, ahead of the first leaders' meeting of Quad, the diplomat said Canberra is ""not walking alone"" in dealing with an increasingly aggressive China as Japan has experienced 10 years ago. In July, he spoke up again, applauding the way Australia has resisted ""economic pressure"" from China. He even went further by saying countries like Australia, Japan and the US ""have to get together"" to address challenges caused by China. Da told the Global Times that deliberately uttering hawkish statements against a third country goes beyond the responsibility and norms of a diplomat.Japan's China containment mentality has become normality. Japan deeply knows that it is not able to compete with China alone, so it pins high hopes on the US and its allies. The deep intertwined economic interests between China and Japan and their common interests in multilateral frameworks such as the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership make Japan walk a tightrope - it doesn't want to come to an open break with China, so it voices out by taking advantage of the conflicts between China and other countries. Such calculating moves may bring Japan some temporary petty geopolitical interests, but potentially risk future ties with China.",OPINION,OBSERVER,Illustration: Chen Xia/GT,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'Australia': ('LOC', 12), 'China': ('LOC', 14), 'Japan': ('LOC', 13), 'US': ('LOC', 7), 'Ukraine': ('LOC', 1), 'Pacific': ('LOC', 1), 'Yamagami Shingo': ('PER', 1), 'Da Zhigang': ('PER', 3), ""China People ' s Liberation Army Navy"": ('ORG', 1), 'Institute of Northeast Asia Studies': ('ORG', 1), 'Heilongjiang Provincial Academy of Social Sciences': ('ORG', 1), 'Global Times': ('ORG', 1), 'anti': ('MISC', 1), 'Indo': ('MISC', 1)}"
38,17-day Beijing Winter Olympics successfully closes curtain on Sunday. What's left for Chinese people and the world?,GT staff reporters,2022-02-21,"

In the past 17 days, participants from almost every part of the world gathered in Beijing for the Winter Olympic Games, where they have tried their utmost to compete with others to obtain medals, but also knelt down to hug opponents when they fall on the snow; where they fought for the honor of their country, but also supported each other even at a time when their countries are at odds… This Winter Olympic Games not only presented the globe with what the International Olympic Committee (IOC) President Thomas Bach hailed as a ""truly exceptional"" sports feast, but also injected much-needed unity and togetherness to a somewhat divided world. Successfully hosting the Winter Olympic Games, under the shadow of the raging COVID-19 and against the backdrop of certain countries staging a geopolitical farce, projected to the world China's ""true nature,"" said observers, noting it is a welcoming country devoted to unifying countries and promoting peace, and a confident country showing off its achievements. For China people, such a winter sports feast will not only bring the country's ice and snow sports to a new high, it will also have infused the people with much confidence about the country's governance, showing the people how well it works. China President Xi Jinping attended the closing ceremony of the Winter Olympic Games, held at the National Stadium in the China capital on Sunday night.During the ceremony, Bach declared the Winter Olympic Games closed.Bach called the Winter Olympic Games ""truly exceptional"" in his speech at the closing ceremony. ""The Olympic spirit could shine so brightly only because the China people set the stage in such an excellent way - and in a safe way,"" said the IOC chief. In four points during his speech, Bach extended his thanks and congratulations to the volunteers and to China the host country in China language. At the ceremony, Beijing mayor Chen Jining handed over the Olympic flag to Bach, who handed it over to the mayors of the 2026 Winter Olympic Games host cities, Milan and Cortina d'Ampezzo, Giuseppe Sala and Gianpietro Ghedina. It will be the second time that Italy hosts the grand winter sporting event in 20 years after the Torino 2006.

Thanks to such a high level of coordination and cooperation, every part fits perfectly, and athletes can compete to the best of their ability, and make new records, breaking human limits. At such a difficult time, Beijing gave the whole world a splendid grand event, and the world has to be amazed about it,"" Juan Antonio Samaranch, chairman of the IOC Coordination Commission for Beijing 2022, told the Global Times on Saturday. As COVID-19, unilateralism, Cold War mentality and other dangerous trends upend the world, this Winter Olympic Games have defied long-term West smears, reflected the ""true nature"" of China, a country that is willing to unite the whole world to contribute a better future for human kind, trumpeting all ideological diversities. It is a country that welcomes international guests to experience the real China, and a country that is confident to show the world its accomplishments and its systems, Zhang Yiwu, a professor of cultural studies at Peking University, told the Global Times on Sunday.This edition of the Winter Olympic Games has won kudos from athletes and officials from many countries. Many athletes filmed touching moments of exchanges with volunteers, the dazzling high-tech equipment within the Olympic Villages and heartwarming services provided by China staff and volunteers at the competition venues and in the athletes' accommodation.

Her videos went viral on China social media platforms after she caught a heartfelt moment at the opening ceremony of the Winter Olympic Games showing a China volunteer saying to her ""welcome to China"" with sweet and kind gesture. She said her eyes were filled with tears when she heard the hospitable words.China's elite male figure skater Jin Boyang and the world-famous Japan figure skater Yuzuru Hanyu made headlines when they tried to form a heart in front of the cameras after the men's single figure skating at the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympic Game on February 10. In an exclusive interview, the China Embassy in Japan told the Global Times days later that the friendly interaction between Jin and Hanyu sparked heated discussion in both China and Japan, which fully highlighted the great attention of the two peoples toward the Winter Olympic Games and the common love for ice and snow sports.Defending champion Oleksandr Abramenko won Ukraine's first medal of the Winter Olympic Games on Wednesday and celebrated by getting a hug from Russia skier Ilia Burov at a time of rising tensions between the countries.Such a scene also passes on the powerful strength that sports transcends borders and melts people's hearts around the globe, and they became the most beautiful sights that decorates the Winter Olympic Games, Li Haidong, a professor at the Institute of International Relations of China Foreign Affairs University, told the Global Times, noting that China's image of an open and friendly country will also be shored up via those moments and this Olympics. ""The Winter Olympic Games tell a real China story. Those athletes are real recorders of China, who came to this country and will pass real information to their home audiences,"" said Zhang. ""Their videos say more about China than those mud-throwing foreign media reports against China.""A Winter sports maniaAnalysts also said that the ""stellar"" performance of Team China during the Olympics, the excellent China athletes, from freeski sensation Gu Ailing to snowboard prodigy Su Yiming, also stunned the world with a high-spirited, positive, confident but not arrogant image of China people, especially China youth.The China delegation has achieved its best performance for an edition of the Winter Olympic Games at the Beijing 2022, with nine gold medals, four silvers and two bronzes. The Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee and the State Council (China's cabinet) sent a congratulatory message to the delegation on Sunday.Such inspiring results stimulated China public's enthusiasm toward winter sports, and led young people to know more about and to devote their passion to winter sports, which is a huge asset the Winter Olympic Games have brought to China, Zhang Xinyun, a sports commentator, told the Global Times on Sunday.Zhang noted Beijing Winter Olympic Games could be a chance for China to better its winter sports infrastructure, to cultivate people who share real passion for ice and snow sports and to push China's winter sports to a new high.Even before the Winter Olympic Games began, a mania for winter sports swept across China as people were filmed skiing, skating from snow-covered Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region in northern China to the sun-kissed Hainan Province in the southern China where people use indoor sports facilities to enjoy skating.  Tu Xiaodong, director of the publicity department of the General Administration of Sport, said on Friday that during its bid for the Winter Olympic Games, China made a commitment to the international community to ""engage 300 million people in ice and snow activities,"" and recent statistics showed that the country has achieved this goal.Above sports itself, Zhang from Peking University believes that the successful hosting of the event has injected new confidence in China society. ""Our comprehensive national strength, the advantage of our system… are all mirrored by this Olympics,"" said Zhang, referring to the dazzling high-tech and green technology used by the Games organizers to test the coronavirus, to make snow and ice and to make athletes live safer and easier life. The flexible COVID-19 measures within the closed loops successfully kept the virus from spreading to any extent. ""Hosting such a grand and splendid sporting festival against such a complicated background serves as vivid example for China people to be confident about the country's governance,"" Zhang said. Through the Winter Olympic Games, I had deeper understanding of a community with a shared future for mankind and the world's recognition of China, a volunteer who asked not to be named told the Global Times. The volunteer said she is proud to serve the event, and even prouder to be China. ""People living in an open country like this must be energetic and confident like they are."" Straddle the hurdles China's hosting of the Winter Olympic Games was not plain sailing. One of the biggest hurdles comes from COVID-19. And on the eve of the Winter Olympic Games, a small group of countries, especially the US, staged a political farce with a so-called diplomatic boycott of the event.Yet more than 32 dignitaries from other countries and international organizations gave a standing ovation at the opening ceremony and conducted fruitful meetings with China leaders during their visits.The closed-loop management system to deal with the coronavirus reported only 437 positive COVID-19 cases, most of which exhibited mild symptoms, and there were no cluster infections reported within the close-looped system. Amid the severe epidemic situation globally, China overcame difficulties and fulfilled its commitments to host the Winter Olympic Games as scheduled, demonstrating its stated responsibility as a major country. By ensuring the health and safety of those participating in the Games and contributing a streamlined, safe and splendid Olympic event to the world, it will also inject more confidence and strength into the global victory against the pandemic, Samaranch told the Global Times.China has orchestrated COVID-19 policies with the closed loop including nucleic acid tests every day and wearing facial masks almost all the time. But it also managed to balance the safety measures with the competition. For example, an athlete confirmed to be an asymptomatic carrier can leave isolation and return to training or competition once he or she presents two negative nucleic acid tests at least 24 hours apart. ""Such a result [in COVID-19 control] is predictable, as it is in fact an extension of China's overall zero-tolerance COVID-19 policy, and proved how successful and flexible such policies can be adopted in different situations,"" Zeng Guang, former chief epidemiologist of the China Center for Disease Control and Prevention, told the Global Times on Sunday. Many athletes and participants gave credit to the Winter Olympic Games COVID-19 measures. Nevin Galmarini, a Swiss snowboarder staying in the Zhangjiakou Olympic Village, told the Global Times that he appreciates the efficiency of the workers and said that it takes less than one minute to finish the test. ""I think China is doing a great job of organizing the Winter Olympic Games, one of the biggest sports events in the world during the pandemic,"" said Galmarini.Brian McCloskey, chairman of the Beijing 2022 medical expert panel, said on February 8 that Beijing is the ""safest place on the planet"" given its anti-coronavirus measures taken during the Winter Olympic Games.Li noted that dignitaries' arrival to China to support the Winter Olympic Games also announced the failure of US tactics to force countries to take sides. ""Those countries' choices say clearly which one is on the right side of history - a small clique mode, or a multilateral mode,"" Li said. When China is showing its determination of promoting unity via the Winter Olympic Games, the US is hyping the tension between Ukraine and Russia and the Joe Biden administration sent Secretary of State Antony Blinken to tour Asia to tout the US intention of ganging up with some countries against China.  In comparison, China is a place that promotes development and peace around the world, said Li, noting that the hosting of the Winter Olympic Games especially highlighted the country's role of serving as major force of upholding global peace. A fruitful legacyBach said on Friday that the Beijing Winter Olympic Games would certainly leave a defining legacy. Many international sports organizations are also discussing with China the possibility of hosting more events including the World Cup in Beijing in the future, Bach noted.  Samaranch also told the Global Times that successfully holding the Winter Olympic Games strongly underscored China's first-class ability to host competitions, especially in terms of venues and organization. The Winter Olympic Games have been affirming the capability of sustainable development from the very beginning. He said that in the Beijing competition zone, the only newly established venue for the ice sports is the Beijing National Speed Skating Oval, known as the Ice Ribbon. Besides, all the other venues for ice competitions have been transformed from as legacies from the Summer Olympics in 2008. This laid a solid foundation for the wide application of multi-projects and multi-business operation after the competition, and is also in line with the green concept of being low carbon and emphasizing environmental protection.""Undoubtedly, I have full confidence in China to hold any other large-scale international sporting events,"" said Samaranch.Representatives from future Winter Olympic Games hosts, such as the organizers of Paris 2024, Milano Cortina 2026, Brisbane 2032 and the Youth Winter Olympic Games Gangwon 2024, are currently getting a behind the scenes look at the day-to-day operational demands of hosting an Winter Olympic Games, media reported last week. Beijing said in 2015 that the cost of hosting the 2022 Winter Olympic Games is among the lowest in two decades at $3.9 billion. China has done an excellent job at hosting a streamlined, green and safe event, which is an important lesson for upcoming similar events, said Li. He said another lesson is to let sports drive the economy, and bring tangible benefits to the people. Cai Qi, president of the Beijing Organizing Committee for the 2022 Olympic and Paralympic Winter Olympic Games, said at a Sunday conference before the closing ceremony that all venues will be reused after the Beijing Olympics. For example, Zhangjiakou will serve as a destination for winter sports and this will surely stimulate local tourism.Some West media, especially US media outlets, which have been sparing no efforts to smear Beijing's preparations for the Winter Olympic Games, were blunted by what the event has achieved and they had to give China credit for its successful hosting of the event. CNN published an article admitting the Olympics was a ""success inside China.""The IOC also said Beijing Winter Olympic Games is the most-watched Winter Olympic Games ever.  ""This edition of the Winter Olympic Games has served as an arena where China has proved that some West countries and media wrong about China on many fronts, be it diplomatic, publicity and COVID-19 control. It is also a lesson for some West countries to reflect why China can accomplish such a mission that seems impossible, why the China mode works,"" said Zhang.",CHINA,SOCIETY,Photo: Li Hao/GT,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'Beijing': ('LOC', 2), 'China': ('LOC', 7), 'National Stadium': ('LOC', 1), 'Milan': ('LOC', 1), 'Am': ('LOC', 1), 'Salian': ('LOC', 1), 'Italy': ('LOC', 1), 'Torino': ('LOC', 1), 'Winter Olympic Games': ('MISC', 11), 'COVID - 19': ('MISC', 1), 'International': ('ORG', 1), 'Committee': ('ORG', 1), 'IOC': ('ORG', 2), 'Thomas Bach': ('PER', 5), 'Xi Jinping': ('PER', 2), 'Chen Jining': ('PER', 1), 'Giuseppe': ('PER', 1)}"
39,"Chinese yuan continues to appreciate against the dollar, as US Federal Reserve is set to raise rates",Global Times,2022-02-21,"The China yuan continued to strengthen against the US greenback as the former is drawing attention as a safe haven asset by global traders who are rattled by possible multiple rates hikes by the Federal Reserve to curb rapidly surging inflation in the US.The exchange rate between the China currency against US dollar hit 6.32 during Monday's trading sessions, hitting a record high for the yuan in nearly four years.The central parity rate of yuan was set 58 basis points lower at 6.3401 yuan against one US dollar on Monday, according to the China Foreign Exchange Trade System.Within China's spot foreign exchange market, the yuan is allowed to rise or fall by 2 percent from the central parity rate each trading day.From the second half of last year, China's foreign exchange market has experienced a trend of stronger yuan under the expectation of the Fed's raising interest rates to contain inflation. ""With rate hike signal becoming clearer and nearer, it indicated higher volatility for global financial markets in 2022. Global traders, acting like birds startled by the mere twang of a bow-string, are looking for safe haven assets,"" Cao Yuanzheng, chairman of BOC International Research, told the Global Times on Monday.The yuan's gain in value is also boosted by a steady inflow of foreign capital to China, which will further strengthen the currency's appreciation, according to a research note by the foreign exchange team of CICC Research.A strong yuan is backed by a robust China economy supported by the country's effective measures to contain the coronavirus, Cao noted. And the currency has helped shield Asia's emerging markets from capital exodus, typically seen when developed market interest rates rise.With China's exports and imports topping $6 trillion for the first time in 2021, a record high, the use of yuan in trade settlement has also increased. Payments using the yuan now make up a record 3.2 percent of market share, according to latest data from the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunications (SWIFT), which has proved the yuan's attractiveness to traders.  The influx of foreign capital into the China market is inseparable from the country's continuous efforts in deepening reforms and widening opening up especially in the financial sector, experts said.In the coming week, the global market will continue to pay attention to the standoff between Russia and Ukraine. As long as there is no critical improvement or deterioration in the situation, the foreign exchange market will likely become less volatile, according to the CICC research team.Since the yuan's recent appreciation is caused by multiple short-term factors, it is hard to predict its trend over the long term, and future depreciation possibility cannot be ruled out, given the monetary policy divergence between China and the US, the evolution of the pandemic as well the outlook of China's exports in 2022, Cao noted.While the US central bank is almost certain to raise rates, the People's Bank of China (PBC), China's central bank, is expected to pursue targeted policy easing to bolster GDP growth. The PBC will use a comprehensive package of monetary policy tools to market liquidity being kept at a reasonably ample level, and ensure that the growth of broad money supply and social financing matches nominal economic growth, according to PBC Governor Yi Gang.Global Times",SOURCE,ECONOMY,"File Photo: A worker counts Chinese currency renminbi banknotes at a bank in Tancheng County of Linyi City, east China's Shandong Province, April 11, 2013.

40,"Chinese FM Wang Yi calls for diplomatic solution, not hyping war over Ukraine issue",GT staff reporters,2022-02-20,"Related parties to the Ukraine crisis should return to the Minsk Agreement, lay out a road map and schedule to solve the problem rather than hyping war and creating panic, China State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi stressed when attending the Munich Security Conference on Saturday.   At the conference, Wang commented on the expansion of NATO, security in EU and the Ukraine tensions in response to questions raised by MSC Chairman Wolfgang Ischinger during the session, according to CGTN.As a product of the Cold War, which has ended long ago, NATO should make necessary adjustments, said the China diplomat. ""If NATO keeps expanding eastward, is it conducive to maintaining peace and stability in EU?"" Wang asked. He reiterated China's stance that all countries' sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity should be respected and safeguarded, adding that Ukraine is no exception to the principle. He urged relevant sides to adhere to the Minsk II agreement reached in 2015 and work out a roadmap and timetable to implement the deal. All sides need to ""shoulder their responsibilities and work for peace"" rather than hyping up tensions and sensationalizing the risk of war, he said. All sides can raise their concerns on security in EU, and Russia's legitimate security concerns should be respected, he added.Wang also noted that Ukraine should be a bridge connecting the West and the East instead of a frontier of confrontations of major powers.Wang's remarks once again made it clear to the international community that China's approach to the Ukraine crisis is to promote reconciliation, instead of adding fuel to the fire or inclined to one side. We are committed to promoting a constructive and responsible position by all parties involved in the Ukraine crisis, and truly contributing to a lasting peace in broader EU. We hope that all parties involved in the Ukraine crisis will reach a consensus to resolve conflicts, Li Haidong, a professor from the Institute of International Relations of China Foreign Affairs University, told the Global Times on Saturday. Wang's remarks came amid US's continuous hyping of Russia's so-called potential invasion into Ukraine. US President Joe Biden said Thursday that the information he got now indicated that Russia was preparing to invade and attack Ukraine and a war was possibly going to happen in the next couple of days.

However, that day passed peacefully with the recent partial pullback of Russia troops from some border areas, although US and NATO said they did not see the pullback and are insistent on their claims of imminent war to prevent an easing of tensions.Because of the repeated incitements by the US and NATO, it is possible a large-scale civil war may break out in Ukraine, Li said.Ukraine affairs should be left to the Ukrainians, but the external forces, especially the US and the NATO, have interfered in Ukraine's internal affairs, said Li. Minsk agreements are about how Ukraine's internal problems can be constructively resolved as well as on how Ukraine can no longer be the trigger for another geopolitical crisis in EU, said Li. Instead of treating Ukraine as a country worthy of respect, the US has exploited the country as a pawn in its geopolitical competition with Russia. This is the root cause of the tragedy in Ukraine, experts noted. Observers pointed out that Russia maintained its strategic composure in dealing with this highly sensitive issue despite some West politicians spouting war rhetoric to hype war risks and media disinformation.Amid tension with the West over the Ukraine issue, Russia leader Vladimir Putin on Saturday oversaw strategic nuclear exercises involving the launch of hypersonic ballistic missiles and other weapons.Wang also talked about issues related to China's Xinjiang region at the Saturday conference.There has never been so-called systematic ""forced labor"" in Xinjiang, nor so-called ""reeducation camp"", which are made-up misinformation and lies, he said.China welcomes UN human rights chief Michelle Bachelet to visit Xinjiang and China is working on the schedule with Bachelet's office, he said.",CHINA,DIPLOMACY,Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi Photo:Ministry of Foreign Affairs,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'Ukraine': ('LOC', 9), 'China': ('LOC', 5), 'Russia': ('LOC', 5), 'West': ('LOC', 2), 'East': ('LOC', 1), 'US': ('LOC', 2), 'Novgorod': ('LOC', 1), 'Minsk Agreement': ('MISC', 1), 'Munich': ('MISC', 1), 'Conference': ('MISC', 1), 'Cold War': ('MISC', 1), 'Minsk II': ('MISC', 1), 'State Council': ('ORG', 1), 'Security': ('ORG', 1), 'NATO': ('ORG', 3), 'EU': ('ORG', 4), 'MSC': ('ORG', 1), 'CGTN': ('ORG', 1), 'Institute': ('ORG', 1), 'Wang Yi': ('PER', 6), 'Wolfgang Ischinger': ('PER', 1), 'Li Hai': ('PER', 1), 'Joe': ('PER', 1)}"
41,Main lesson from Nixon's historic visit is to focus on common interests: Chas Freeman,Global Times,2022-02-20,"Editor's Note:Monday marks the 50th anniversary of US president Richard Nixon's historic visit to China. Recalling this breakthrough trip, Chas W. Freeman Jr (Freeman), who was a lead translator for Nixon during the visit, said the biggest lesson we should learn from the trip is that China and the US ""could set aside ideology in the interest of cooperating to common ends."" He called for the US to make the first move and change its China strategy that emphasizes competition to break ice in current China-US relations. The following is the full transcript of an interview between Freeman and Global Times (Global Times) reporters Yu Jincui and Bai Yunyi.

Global Times: Nixon once called his ice-breaking visit to China in 1972 ""the week that changed the world."" During that week, you were also in China as a member of the US delegation. What impressed you most in China that week?Freeman: The weather was clear. The skies were blue. There was no pollution in Beijing then. I loved hearing people in speaking with their distinctive Beijing accent.  And I thought the China side of the talks was very well prepared, very professional.  I was impressed. One cannot help but be struck by Beijing as the capital of a country that has many years of history. While I was impressed with China as a culture, as a civilization, this was not the high point of China achievement. That came later.Global Times: That visit left a good impression on both the China and US people. What implications does this have for today's China-US relations?Freeman: Both countries in 1972 approached each other with the idea that we could cooperate despite differences. So we set the differences aside and focused on common interests. This was a very appropriate approach, and it yielded great results for both countries. I think we can learn from this. We should not be talking about competition first. We should be talking about cooperation first. The main lesson of the Nixon-Mao meeting was that we could set aside ideology in the interest of cooperating to common ends.This is very important. But to prepare the Shanghai communiqué, we spent a lot of time talking about the disagreements between US over wars, over Korea, over Kashmir, and other issues. It was very important to reassure our respective friends. China had a relationship with North Korea and North Vietnam, but we had a relationship with South Korea and South Vietnam. China had a relationship with Pakistan that was important to it. And so forth. So we had to demonstrate to our friends that despite our cooperation on a strategic level, we had not sold out their interests. We had not negotiated behind their back. We were faithful to our commitments to our partners.Global Times: A view in the US holds that Nixon's visit 50 years ago was a mistake, so is the US engagement policy of China. How do you comment on this?Freeman: Those who make this argument have forgotten the circumstances in which the US and China reached out to each other and the major gains for both sides from doing this. They also seem oblivious to the very positive developments in China and the world that the opening of relations between the two countries generated. Instead of acknowledging the many benefits to the world and the US that flowed from China's emergence as a prosperous participant in the post-World War II, US-sponsored world order, they object to the loss of US global and regional preeminence and the inability of the US to have its way unilaterally. That is narrow-minded and short-sighted. Nixon believed that the world could not be peaceful or prosperous if China had no constructive relationship with the US and was left outside the postwar order. He was right. Global Times: The normalization of China-US relations began with ping-pong diplomacy. This year's Winter Olympic Games are also the focus of attention of both China and the US. If you observe the interaction between the two countries over the Winter Olympic Games, what conclusions would you draw?Freeman: I was present at the meeting in the secretary of state's office on Christmas day, 1979, after the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan. And I was the one of two people there who opposed the Olympic boycott in Moscow. I did so for several reasons. First, I think sports need to be kept separate from politics. Second, I thought we were setting a precedent that would come back to hurt US. That was indeed the case when the Soviet Union boycotted the Los Angeles Olympics four years later.Global Times: The Olympics are supposed to be an event going beyond politics. But the US launched a diplomatic boycott. Some see this as an indication of US's anxiety about its declining strength, what do you think?Freeman: This is a very bad time in terms of international relationships generally. We had in the Donald Trump administration a secretary of state Mike Pompeo who went out of his way to insult China and other countries. China has its wolf warrior diplomacy. Both of these things have cost each of US dearly internationally. So I'm sorry to say that this is a bad time for diplomacy. I think we should all remember that the basis of diplomacy is mutual respect, empathy, understanding the viewpoint of the other even if you don't agree with it, and dealing with the other's viewpoint on a respectful basis. That is what I hope we will rediscover.

Charles W. Freeman Jr. Photo: Courtesy of Charles W. Freeman Jr.Global Times: In the Nixon era, China and the US had almost no exchanges, but they could move toward engagement; today, the two are interdependent, but the shadow of a new Cold War looms over bilateral relations. If we want to have an ice-breaking, where do you think today we should start?Freeman: I would say that frankly, the first move needs to be made by the US. We have a government which emphasizes competition with China. I think that is wrong. I think we should emphasize cooperation. We should say we want to cooperate with China on common issues where we have the same interests. If we can't cooperate directly, we should coordinate our policies so that we cooperate in parallel.There are some issues on which we will compete, and we will do so fiercely. Finally, there are some issues on which we absolutely do not agree. And we may be opposed to each other. That is realistic. But we should start with an emphasis on finding areas where we can cooperate and setting aside other issues for later resolution.When we opened this relationship 50 years ago, we had a very concrete, very real common threat of Soviet expansion. And now we have threats that are more abstract and less immediate - climate change, pandemics, nuclear proliferation. These are, in some ways, greater threats than the Soviet army represented in 1969-72. But people don't take them so seriously. It's very easy to regard them as long term and to continue thinking only in the short term. Can we find a way to discover these common interests?So can we find a way to cooperate? I think the start to that is, as the China side has said, mutual respect. I think the China side reflects a concern about face. Face, or mianzi, is the self esteem that you gain from the respect of others. It's a major force in China culture. We have similar concerns in US culture, but probably a different concern about what we call honor.So we need to find a way to bridge these and to recognize that despite our disagreements, there are many reasons for US to work together.Global Times: Under the current situation when toughness against China is the mainstream of US politics, do US policymakers have the ability to change the course that focused on competition and find new strategies that are in line with US interests?Freeman: Sadly the US political system is stalemated. It is in gridlock. President Joe Biden has limited if no freedom to depart from the Donald Trump policies toward China and other issues, because he has no clear majority in the House or Senate.And all of the indications are that in 2022 when we have a midterm election, he may be further weakened. Fifty years ago, the US took the first step in opening to China. China has been relatively passive until recently. Historically, we US have taken the initiative, but I don't think our political condition at the moment will now allow US to do that.So I'm quite pessimistic that we will see any improvement in the relationship in the near term. And I note that in China, there are similar constraints. That is to say, both countries have seen a surge of nationalist opposition to each other, the so-called netizens in China. This is a bad situation. I don't see it improving in the near term.Global Times: Compared with 50 years ago, US domestic politics is more fragmented, polarized, and to some extent more populist. Can politicians overcome domestic politics if they want to improve China-US relations?Freeman: Not in the short term. I will say two things. The US republic, which began as an experiment 250 years ago and which has been very successful, is now unraveling. If I were China, I would be very cautious about the prospects of the US. I would not bet against US. We have so much going for US, geopolitically, with two wide oceans, tremendous bounty of agricultural land, a very diverse human population, institutions that have generated a great deal of global innovation and a capacity for reform, which I admit we are not seeing at the moment.So I think there is a problem among those in China who say the day of the US has passed. I think the day of US may be dim but brightness can return.Global Times: Donald Trump is planning to bid for the 2024 presidential elections. Do you think he will come back? And what does that mean for China, for the US and for China-US relations?Freeman: I don't know whether he will come back or not. I don't think anybody does. But the fact that this is a real question is indicative of a major problem in the US. We have a political order in our country that is in a state of confusion.That is very menacing to our republic which was founded almost 250 years ago. It's lasted a long time. The constitution of our republic, however, is now largely ignored by our political class. And the system is not working. Donald Trump is somebody who exploits a widespread dissatisfaction with the current US condition. And if he does not come back, there are others like him who are prepared to take his place.Global Times: How do you predict the development of China-US relations in 2022? Are we going to have a tougher year, or a relatively smoother year than previous years?Freeman: There is a lot happening internationally. There is a crisis in EU over EU security architecture, and the possible expansion of the US sphere of influence, represented by NATO, to the borders of Russia through Ukraine. Russia is using shows of force to propel a negotiation about this. I don't know whether that negotiation will occur or not. I see that China has been very cautious about the issue of Ukraine, but clearly considers NATO to be something more than a defensive alliance, given its dismemberment of Serbia, promotion of the independence of Kosovo, and its intervention in Afghanistan and Libya.So NATO, which once was a purely defensive alliance, now clearly has elements of offense. This is of concern to China, especially because NATO has begun to express hostile opinions about China.We also have the breakdown of the understandings over how to set aside the Taiwan issue in US-China relations. Besides, China is now risking a lot in the new approach to a common prosperity. It is not clear that it will work. China has previously been applying models it adapted from abroad. Now it is striking out on its own with a new, purely China approach. Will it work? And, as I mentioned earlier, the midterm elections here in the US could have major effects on the Joe Biden administration's ability to take initiatives.So I think this is going to be a year of living dangerously. There will be many ups and downs. And it's very hard to say how it will all turn out.Global Times: You just mentioned the Taiwan issue. Does the Taiwan question constitute the biggest obstacle to improving relations? Is there a possibility that the red line will be crossed leading to a complete breakdown of China-US relations?Freeman: The common understanding between Taipei and Beijing that facilitated dialogue has broken down. The US cannot decide what relationship people in Taiwan and the China mainland want to have with each other. China have to do that themselves. But at the moment, there is no positive dialogue across the Taiwan Strait. So this is a very dangerous issue. And it's one that inflames passions in China on nationalist grounds and challenges the US sense of honor embodied in our pledge to be friends with people in Taiwan. And we cannot simply turn our back on them. So this is a very difficult issue emotionally. We need to find a way not to talk about military solutions, which would devastate Taiwan, whatever happened. The US and China would become bitter enemies for a long time. If the US prevailed in a war with China and Taiwan was separated from the rest of China, China would not give up.The question then is, can we find a way to solve two questions? One, what is the strategic importance of Taiwan to China and to the US and by extension to Japan? Is there a way to neutralize Taiwan in strategic terms? Second point is, can people in Taiwan who are China but who have acquired a distinct identity find peace with people on the mainland? Is the mainland prepared to treat them in a way that gives them face so that they can make friends with people they regard with suspicion? I think those are the issues. And I think this is indeed the most critical matter in US-China relations.Global Times: What will be the biggest risks and uncertainties in bilateral relations in 2022?Freeman: One of them is, in fact, the Taiwan question. This is uncertain. This is a three-way issue, which means that all three parties can make mistakes. If any one of them makes a mistake, there will be a problem.",OPINION,VIEWPOINT,"This file photo taken on February 24, 1972 shows US President Richard Nixon (C) and US Secretary of State William Rogers (R) visiting the Great Wall of China, north of Beijing, during an official visit in China.Photo: AFP",Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'US': ('LOC', 8), 'China': ('LOC', 14), 'Beijing': ('LOC', 3), 'Shanghai': ('LOC', 1), 'Kashmir': ('LOC', 1), 'North Korea': ('LOC', 2), 'North Vietnam': ('LOC', 1), 'South Korea': ('LOC', 2), 'South Vietnam': ('LOC', 1), 'Pakistan': ('LOC', 1), 'Richard Nixon': ('PER', 4), 'Chas W.

42,"Wading in uncharted waters, US lacks a true leader to land safely",Wen Sheng,2022-02-20," Since 2016, when Donald Trump was elected to the White House, the US has gradually waded into uncharted waters, like a lone boat drifting afar from shore. The US is being blindfolded by short-sighted politicians. The absence of true statesmen like Franklin D. Roosevelt or Bill Clinton has left US blind to its true situation. Now facing a stubborn high inflation, an ever-growing wealth gap and racial division, as well as an elusive but still-killing pandemic at home, the Joe Biden administration is mired in a quagmire. It seems that throngs of Joe Biden's supporters are deserting him, dimming his hope to keep the Democratic Party's majority in the two chambers of the US Congress in the midterm elections later this year. On the global stage, the tense standoff between Russia and Ukraine is unlikely to be resolved any time soon, because of the US government's paranoid move to enlist more East EU countries into its military alliance, in order to boost the NATO and US's bid to ramp up confrontation with Moscow. Any escalation of the standoff in EU is certain to exacerbate hostility in EU, which will inevitably jeopardize global financial markets, the Wall Street in particular. When the US equities market crashes, the country is likely to go down with it. It is US's dumb policies, one after another, which have led to the US' current predicament. A China proverb says that only a fool will lift a stone to drop on his own feet - words that accurately sum up the last five years of the US government. A recent report by the US Trade Representative Office said that ""we cannot build a wall between the US and China and assume that it will address the problems"" faced by the two nations, because ""that would ignore China's importance to, and integration in, the world economy"". The Office said it will explore ""new trade tools"" to engage with China. What the US report did not say explicitly is its unprecedented trade war with China, launched by Donald Trump and inherited by Joe Biden, failed to damage China's giant economy. On the contrary, the excess tariffs levied by the US on China goods have contributed, significantly, to the inflated commodity prices in US, while China is sailing with steadily rising exports with almost every trade partner in the world.  In January, US inflation surged by 7.5 percent, the highest level in 40 years, drawing uproars of grievance from the US public making lives harder and households poorer. In sharp contrast, consumer price index rose merely 0.9 percent in the same month in China. From the onset of the trade war in 2018, China officials and economists had warned that imposing higher punitive tariffs on more than $360 billion of China goods would not end well with the US, simply because China is the world's largest and most important manufacturing engine. If an economy turns its back on China goods, it undoubtedly will suffer from a self-inflicted supply chain disruption, and, shortage of commodities and price hikes. And, who could have predicted that pumping money by the Joe Biden administration and the Federal Reserve into an unproductive or ailing economy like the US' would be this inflationary? But the US' former secretary of treasury Lawrence Summers and other renowned economists sounded the alarm a year ago. Janet Yellen, the incumbent secretary of treasury, said months ago that Donald Trump's tariffs war with China inflated the prices in the US and suggested the duties be removed, but she was silenced by other agenda driven administration officials. The world has not heard from Yellen for many months. It's very regretful that the Joe Biden team did not move to correct the erroneous course of the Donald Trump administration in its dealings with China. In the past 12 months, the White House even hardened its geopolitical posturing, trying to contain China's economic rise by placing dozens of China high-tech companies on its sanctioning list. One result of the economic confrontation is global supply disruptions of important industrial proponents like semiconductor microchips, which made new and used cars particularly expensive on the market.On ways to tackle the pandemic, the US mainstream media has kept criticizing China's ""dynamic zero COVID-19"" playbook, while the US itself has wobbled from mask and vaccine mandates to lifting the mandates prematurely and recklessly.The result is gruesome - whenever there erupted a new variant, Delta, Omicron or others, new waves of infections, hospitalizations and deaths had gripped the US. Possibly to seek psychological comfort, some US media outlets are portending how many China people would get infected and die, once China decides to open its door to let foreigners freely in. The latest USTR report said the US strategy should focus on the long term and needs to be ""more flexible and sophisticated"" in interacting with China. It is a subtle change of tone by the Joe Biden administration, being perplexed by soaring inflation. But the US government should do more. It needs to stop viewing China as the US' strategic foe, eliminating the trade tariffs and removing all the China companies from its sanctioning blacklist, stopping interfering in China's domestic affairs, and abolish its Cold War-mode hostile groupings like the QUAD and AUKUS. Otherwise, mistrust toward the US among billions of China people being built up since 2016 won't easily go, who will continue to demand Beijing speed up modernization of China's economy, technology and national defense. The author is an editor with the Global Times. bizopinion@globaltimes.com.cn",SOURCE,ECONOMY,Illustration: Chen Xia/Global Times,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'Donald Trump': ('PER', 2), 'Franklin D.

43,"Huawei may enter a critical time for return to Europe, after major economies signal policy turnaround",Global Times,2022-02-20," China technology giant Huawei - which has been put on the US Entity List - is entering a critical time for returning to EU as major economies in the EU signal a policy turnaround involving new restrictions on telecom market access, analysts said.The UK government announced plans to delay removing Huawei gears from its mobile networks by six months on Friday. The original deadline for cutting the share of Huawei equipment to 35 percent of its telecom network was set at January 2023. According to a statement from the UK government, the delay was ""because COVID-19 pandemic and associated social distancing measures have impacted providers' abilities to reconfigure their networks in order to meet the advisory deadline"".Ma Jihua, a veteran telecommunications industry analyst, told the Global Times on Sunday that the UK has actually made ""little substantial moves"" on removing Huawei gears in recent years, due to its business interests and the immense expense to dismantle Huawei equipment that the virus-hit economy cannot afford.Ma said that the UK's six-month delay could also be a strategy for it to ""wait and see"" the results of the US midterm elections in November and how that will reshape US policies, and it leaves time for UK to adjust its policies correspondingly.In 2020, the UK government announced measures restricting Huawei's access to its market, including the 35-percent share cap and a pledge to remove all Huawei equipment from its 5G networks by 2027. The Telegraph reported over the weekend that the UK government is not revising the 2027 deadline.""The global pandemic is entering the third year, and things are now quite different from 2020, when some West developed economies formed small circles to crack down Huawei in order to echo US sanctions,"" Ma said, noting that there's little incentive for the EU bloc now to either continue or impose new restrictions on Huawei.Now, many EU governments are preoccupied with a bunch of issues ranging from economic rebooting to settling the Ukraine situation, industry observers said. In fact, major economies in EU in recent months have shown a U-turn in their stances with regard to economic ties with China. More countries are pushing for pragmatic cooperation with China. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson is reportedly considering restarting trade talks with China that have been on ice for years. The top leaders from China and France had a phone call on February 16, and now, China stands ready to work with France to advance the ratification of the China-EU investment agreement, the Xinhua News Agency reported.The two countries also reached a consensus on each providing a fair, just and non-discriminatory business environment for companies from the other, which has significant implications for Huawei's future operations in France. ""How the major economies in EU act is symbolic and could sway smaller EU economies' policies toward China firms,"" Ma said. Global Times",SOURCE,COMPANIES,A flagship store of Huawei Photo: VCG,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'China': ('LOC', 5), 'UK': ('LOC', 8), 'US': ('LOC', 3), 'Ukraine': ('LOC', 1), 'U': ('LOC', 1), 'France': ('LOC', 1), 'Huawei': ('ORG', 8), 'EU': ('ORG', 5), 'Global Times': ('ORG', 1), 'The Telegraph': ('ORG', 1), 'Huei': ('ORG', 1), 'US En': ('MISC', 1), 'List': ('MISC', 1), 'COD': ('MISC', 1), '19': ('MISC', 1), 'West': ('MISC', 1), 'Ma Jihua': ('PER', 3), 'Boris Johnson': ('PER', 1)}"
44,Is New Delhi willing to solve border disputes and repair ties with China?,Xia Wenxin,2022-02-20,"India External Affairs Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar recently has twice mentioned the China-India border dispute on a multilateral occasion. New Delhi may try to exploit the force of the international community to embolden itself and further play with fire on the border issue. Such a dangerous tendency is what China needs to be wary of.Meanwhile, India has also been warning against what it calls a ""debt trap"" brought by aid from China, attempting to block cooperation between China and other regional countries.So far, India has not shown that it is willing to repair its relations with China, said experts. It hasn't shown any willingness to make compromise or leave room for negotiation. Instead, New Delhi keeps using provocative words to disrupt the already fragile mutual trust between the two countries and intensify the conflict.India's relations with China are going through a ""very difficult phase"" because Beijing violated border agreements, said Jaishankar at a panel discussion at the Munich Security Conference 2022 on Saturday.  On February 12, he made similar remarks during a joint news conference in Melbourne after a bilateral meeting with his Australia counterpart, held on the sidelines of the 4th Quad foreign ministers' meeting.Lan Jianxue, head of the Department for Asia-Pacific Studies at the China Institute of International Studies, told the Global Times that New Delhi may intend to internationalize the China-India border dispute, a bilateral matter. In his opinion, India now seems to find it difficult to achieve its goals under a bilateral framework, therefore, it turns to other countries. By leveraging their power, India hopes to pressure China to make a concession over the border issue.Besides, as the tension over Ukraine crisis grows, India fears that all attention from the US and the West, in general, is on Russia and EU instead of the Indo-Pacific region. By mentioning the border dispute with Beijing, New Delhi is grabbing US's attention and screaming ""Don't ignore my appeals! Please continue your suppression and containment of China!""However, India is being unrealistic. First of all, for any two countries, bilateral issues should be discussed under a bilateral framework where both sides can directly express their core concerns and demands. This is the most convenient and effective way to resolve bilateral disputes. The China Embassy in India noted in a statement in October 2020 that ""the boundary question is a bilateral matter between China and India… China and India have the wisdom and ability to handle their differences properly. There's no space for a third party to intervene.""On the other hand, few third party countries have the intention to intervene in the dispute between China and India. They know perfectly well that an intervention, be it direct or indirect, will definitely affect their relations with China. According to Lan, these forces also clearly understand that India is just using them and the current international situation to gain more leverage in the border dispute and to use their power to intimidate China. India's intention is failing and will never succeed.Jaishankar also implied on Saturday that regional countries should be warned against a potential ""debt trap"" behind China aid. Coincidentally, some India media outlets reported Sunday that Sri Lanka is moving away from China while getting close to India over the failure by Colombo to pay back China loans worth $4.5 billion, amid fears of a ""debt trap.""Jaishankar's statement may be seen as disrespectful by some countries in the region, said Long Xingchun, a senior research fellow at the Academy of Regional and Global Governance of the Beijing Foreign Studies University. He pointed out that the loans the regional countries received were not imposed by China, but were accepted by each country based on their conditions. These nations don't need India to make decisions for them, he noted.According to Long, India is actually trying to prevent these regional countries from obtaining resources from China and cooperating. In New Delhi's eyes, those countries can only cooperate with India. The point is that India itself has no capacity to drive the development of these nations, but it cannot prevent China from providing development impetus. Jaishankar asserted that ""the state of the border will determine the state of the relationship."" But if India really wants to settle its border issue with China, it needs to understand it is the one that has caused the current impasse between the two countries. A new round of tension was created when India tried to unilaterally change the status quo on the China-India border by enhancing infrastructure construction in the disputed area. The fundamental solution to this dispute is India changing its rigid position on the border issue.New Delhi has already had some unrealistic expectations from external forces, such a fantasy can possibly encourage India to make more provocative moves around the border. Lan thinks history has proven that India was also provocative on the border issue when it thought the international environment was favorable to it. ""India should learn from history. It has to pragmatically recognize the current international environment, the situation of the relationship between China and India over the border, and its own strength. Only in this way can it avoid strategic miscalculation,"" he noted.The author is a reporter with the Global Times. opinion@globaltimes.com.cn",OPINION,VIEWPOINT,"Indian Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar speaks on stage during the 58th Munich Security Conference (MSC) in Munich, southern Germany on Saturday.

45,Ukraine crisis 'could escalate' but all-out war unlikely: experts,Yang Sheng,2022-02-20,"Russia Army West Military District tank units wait to be loaded on a troop train on February 18, 2022, as they return from recent routine drills to permanent deployment sites in Novgorod. Russia announced a withdrawal of drill troops on February 15 amid the Ukraine crisis. Photo: VCGThe Ukraine crisis remains tense and is becoming more complicated as the US and NATO keep hyping the war concerns over the continent of EU and Russia took further actions including nuclear deterrence drills since the West made no response to its security concerns. As the Winter Olympic Games concluded on Sunday and the UN Olympic Truce for Beijing 2022 will finish, analysts said the crisis is likely to escalate although an all-out war is unlikely.China continues to make efforts to urge a peaceful solution and suggest the parties should talk based on the Minsk Agreement signed in 2015, which was aimed at ending the Ukraine civil war and was endorsed by the UN. Vladimir Putin and France President Emmanuel Macron discussed the need to step up the search for diplomatic solutions to the escalating crisis in eastern Ukraine in a phone call on Sunday, the Kremlin said in a statement.""In view of the urgency of the situation, the presidents acknowledged the need to intensify the search for solutions through diplomatic means via the foreign ministries and political advisers to the leaders of the Normandy format,"" the Kremlin said in a statement.""These contacts should facilitate the restoration of the cease-fire regime and ensure progress in the settlement of the conflict in Donbass,"" the statement said.Vladimir Putin once again emphasized the need for the US and NATO to take Russia’s demands to ensure its security guarantees as seriously as possible and to respond specifically and to the point, according to the Kremlin.However, some voices from the West show hostility and make groundless accusations against China and Russia, said China experts, noting that the EU needs to stay independent and make decisions based on its own interests and security, rather than follow the US position too closely.Ursula von der Leyen, president of the EU Commission, said at the Munich Security Conference 2022 that “We are facing a blatant attempt to rewrite the rules of our international system. One only has to read the recent communiqué issued by Russia and China leaders. They seek a ‘new era', as they say, to replace the existing international order. They prefer the rule of the strongest to the rule of law, intimidation instead of self-determination, coercion instead of cooperation.”Wang Yiwei, director of the institute of international affairs at the Renmin University of China, told the Global Times on Sunday that “clearly, von der Leyen’s remarks showed that some EU officials are expressing views that are closer to the US position by distorting the China-Russia joint statement and imposing their views on international order based on hegemony to others.”China and Russia support and safeguard the international system with the UN at its core, rather than an order dominated by the US and its allies, and this order is a post-World War II order, rather than a post-Cold War order. Since West countries consider they are the winners of the Cold War, NATO needs to keep expanding and does not need to respect the concerns of Russia, said China experts.“In the narrative of the West media, Russia looks like an aggressive power to bully Ukraine and try to interrupt Ukraine’s diplomacy on obtaining NATO membership, but very few of them explain why Russia is so worried about NATO’s expansion,” said a Beijing-based expert on international relations who asked for anonymity. “After the Cold War, we didn’t see peace in EU, we saw a war to break former Yugoslavia into pieces, and numerous people were killed in NATO airstrikes, and the China embassy in Belgrade was bombed in the war. We also saw NATO deploying weapons and missile defense systems around Russia to undermine the strategic nuclear balance,” he said. Now the US is trying to impose similar approaches in the Asia-Pacific region by forming alliances like Quad and AUKUS to contain China in the same way as to Russia, to increase uncertainty for regional peace and stability, the expert said. “All of this shows why China’s view is different from the West on the Ukraine situation, and why we believe Russia’s security concern is legitimate and should be resolved. The China-Russia relationship is not an alliance like NATO is, and China people are monitoring the situation based on their independent thinking.”China State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi on Saturday urged all parties to take due responsibilities and make efforts towards peace on the Ukraine issue, instead of just escalating tensions, creating panic and even playing up war threat.In terms of the expansion of the NATO, Wang said at Munich Security Conference that EU friends should seriously ponder whether continuous NATO eastward expansion would be conducive to maintaining and achieving lasting peace and stability in EU.On the Ukraine issue, it is time to return to the original point of the Minsk-2 agreement as soon as possible, since this agreement is a binding one reached through negotiations among all parties concerned and has been approved by the UN, and it is the only way out for solving the Ukraine issue, he said.Lü Xiang, a research fellow at the China Academy of Social Sciences, said that the EU is not a sovereign country so its leaders will present different voices. Von der Leyen’s remarks represent the pro-US group in EU, while national leaders of major EU powers like France and Germany show more neutral and independent stances.“The Munich Security Conference is an event sponsored by the US military industry giants and serves as a platform for the US to strengthen trans-Atlantic ties with the EU, so the remarks that could be heard in the venue would be mostly pro-US rather than showing EU’s independence,” Wang said. The Ukraine crisis persists with US President Joe Biden continuing to hype Friday that he is “convinced” Russia President Vladimir Putin has decided to invade Ukraine, “including an assault on the capital,” according to the AP, while the Russia Armed Forces conducted a strategic deterrence force drills on Saturday under the direction of Vladimir Putin, according to TASS.If diplomatic channels between Russia and the West fall into stalemate, then it is  possible that Russia might take further action to push the US and NATO to make a clear response to its security concerns rather than keep hyping war concerns via releasing disinformation, but this kind of action will be limited and precise, rather than an all-out war against the whole Ukraine, said Yang Jin, an associate research fellow at the Institute of Russia, EU and Central Asia Studies under the China Academy of Social Sciences.Lü said an all-out war between Russia and Ukraine will bring no gains but only heavy costs to Russia, and it will harm Ukraine and even the whole of EU if it spirals out of control. As they are all China’s partners, China would not like to see this happen as the international strategic balance will be deeply damaged, “but this will benefit the US.”The US is trying to undermine the EU’s independence and tighten the trans-Atlantic ties by hyping up a crisis, and Moscow will not be used by US to offer a war to make the EU stand closer to the US, experts said",CHINA,DIPLOMACY,Picture description not found,"Reporter, Beijing","Yang Sheng is a chief reporter at the Global Times covering Chinese politics, diplomacy and military.","{'Russia': ('LOC', 6), 'Novgorod': ('LOC', 1), 'Ukraine': ('LOC', 4), 'US': ('LOC', 3), 'West': ('LOC', 2), 'Beijing': ('LOC', 1), 'China': ('LOC', 4), 'France': ('LOC', 1), 'Kremlin': ('LOC', 3), 'Donbass': ('LOC', 1), 'Munich': ('LOC', 1), 'Army West Military District': ('ORG', 1), 'VC': ('ORG', 1), 'NATO': ('ORG', 2), 'UN': ('ORG', 2), 'Ursula': ('ORG', 1), 'EU Commission': ('ORG', 3), 'Conference': ('ORG', 1), 'Winter Olympic Games': ('MISC', 1), 'Olympic Truce': ('MISC', 1), 'Minsk Agreement': ('MISC', 1), 'Normandy': ('MISC', 1), 'Vladimir Putin': ('PER', 2), 'Emmanuel Macron': ('PER', 1)}"
46,"Bidding farewell to Beijing 2022 with tears, hugs and hope",GT staff reporters,2022-02-20,"It's time to say goodbye, but for many athletes, it's hard to do so after they have enjoyed so many joyful and memorable moments during the Winter Olympic Games  Beijing 2022. Some Olympians bid farewell in their own ways, like Japan figure skating superstar Yuzuru Hanyu, who kissed the ice and bowed deeply to the audience, and US legendary snowboarder Shaun White, who took his final ride and waved goodbye as Team USA called it ""the end of an era."" Shortly after the closing ceremony of the Beijing 2022 began at 8pm on Sunday at the National Stadium, athletes marched to the center stage, waving and cheering to the audience. It was also a moment to celebrate their accomplishments after years of hard work, tears and sacrifices. Despite wearing facial masks, the athletes delivered a joyful message with palpable excitement, as it was not only the end of the Winter Olympic Games but also the start of a new journey. ""This unforgettable experience was only possible because of our gracious hosts, the China people,"" International Olympic Committee (IOC) President Thomas Bach said at the closing ceremony. He also thanked organizers, public authorities and volunteers for their hard work organizing and hosting the Games.

The figure skaters bid farewell to Bing Dwen Dwen at the figure skating exhibition gala of the Beijing Games on February 20, 2022. The ""Moment of Remembrance"" is a very important part of the Winter Olympic Games' closing ceremony. The theme ""A Willow Twig,"" presented in a segment at the Beijing 2022 closing ceremony, underscores the traditional China culture and philosophy in the practice of asking a person to stay when bidding farewell.For some foreign athletes, bidding farewell to this special Olympic trip amid COVID-19 pandemic was sad, as they were warmly welcomed and much amazed by the China people, their delicious food and splendid culture. ""I feel so sad that I had to leave China so soon, but I have loved all the messages and comments that I received from you guys,"" Jenise Spiteri, the first snowboarder to represent the EU island of Malta, said in the first post on her account on China Twitter-like Sina Weibo. As she would soon leave China, she took to the China social media platform as a way of staying in touch with her China friends and fans. ""It is so amazing to hear how I've affected people's lives, and how others are inspired to keep working toward their goals and dreams,"" Spiteri told the Global Times on Sunday. ""I really can't believe it. All of the connections I feel to people in China now are so special and I never expected this to happen."" Over the past 17 days, the Beijing 2022 created opportunities for athletes to compete together, exchange gifts, hug each other, and make new friends. Global audiences were deeply moved by the moments when Oleksandr Abramenko of Ukraine embraced Russia skier Ilia Burov when they won the silver and bronze medals in freestyle skiing, and when US curlers Chris Plys and Victoria Persinger gave badges in return after receiving a commemorative gift - pin badges of the Beijing Winter Olympic mascot Bing Dwen Dwen - from their China opponents, underscoring sportsmanship and the Olympic spirit. Many spectators also remembered a touching moment when US skier Ashley Caldwell gave a big hug to her friend and counterpart Xu Mengtao, cheering ""Taotao! Olympic champion! In your own country! I'm so proud of you!""The world needs such reunions through the bridge of sports more than ever after it experienced a pandemic that has lasted about three years, severely disrupting the ways that people live and interact, and leading to a series of problems such as racism, hatred and xenophobia, which made the world somewhat very divided place, according to observers. ""We are all equal regardless of what we look like, where we come from or what we believe in. This unifying power of the Winter Olympic Games is stronger than the forces that want to divide US,"" Bach said at the closing ceremony. 'Thank you, China' ""Athletes from different places and with different colors of skin came together, and people of different races and different faiths embraced the same dream, as we can see since the competitions started... A lot of moments about friendship and sportsmanship among young athletes have been captured,"" Juan Antonio Samaranch, the newly elected IOC vice president and the chairman of the IOC Coordination Commission for Beijing 2022, told the Global Times in a recent exclusive interview. ""The friendship at the platform of multicultural exchange transcends politics, country and race,"" Samaranch said.

Photo: XinhuaBesides the sportsmanship shining at the Beijing Winter Olympic Games, special bonds between foreign athletes, volunteers and the most-loved mascot Bing Dwen Dwen, which were established through the Games, became another reason for athletes who found it difficult to say goodbye. On her last day in China recently, US snowboarder Tessa Maud shared a video on social media platforms saying she ""is so sad"" as she was leaving China and she was going to cry on the plane. Her videos went viral on China social media after she caught a heartfelt moment at the opening ceremony of the Winter Olympic Games showing a China volunteer saying to her ""Welcome to China"" with a sweet and kind gesture.""I leave Beijing in the morning and I've really enjoyed my time here,"" Carlo Valdes, US bobsledder, told the Global Times on Sunday, noting that he hoped to come back one day. ""Thank you China for showing up and putting on a great Olympics for US!"" US Olympic skier Aaron Blunck said in a post on Instagram on Saturday.""I'll miss all,"" bobsledder Edson Bindilatti from Brazil told the Global Times in responding to what he would miss the most about China. ""We were welcomed with open arms, by all the volunteers,"" he said, noting that many beautiful memories left by the Games such as the hospitality of China people and well-organized management.  As the Winter Olympic Games drew to an end, Sunday also marked the last day for the most-loved Olympic mascot Bing Dwen Dwen. Checking out of his last ""working hours,"" Bing Dwen Dwen bowed to the volunteers several times to say goodbye and to thank them for their efforts in ensuring the spectacular sports event. For about 18,000 volunteers who served the Beijing Games, it was also a hard thing to say goodbye. Six representatives of the volunteers showed up on the stage in the stadium during the closing ceremony, receiving warm applause from the audience and lanterns as gifts from IOC. Their hard work and invaluable contributions to the Games were a pillar force in ensuring its success.

47,Typical US scam: Hoaxing Ukraine into paying for ‘protection’: Global Times editorial,Global Times,2022-02-18,"The UN held a special meeting on the situation in Ukraine on Thursday, during which US Secretary of State Antony Blinken again quoted intelligence obtained by the US as claiming that Russia was preparing to launch an attack against Ukraine in the coming days. As February 16, previously cited as the invasion day, became a joke, some US media outlets proposed a new ""invasion date"" - February 20. It can be assumed that once that day passes, US will come up with a new guess. When it comes to a ""war,"" the US has long launched one against Russia, a hybrid information war. This time, Russia asked the council to discuss the Minsk agreements, yet the meeting was deviated by the US from the original theme with the hype of the ""war."" As a result, the real problem remains unresolved. The longer Russia and Ukraine are in a state of high tension, the more likely an eruption of that tension will be. From this perspective, the risk of an outbreak of war between the two exists and is constantly on the rise. Antony Blinken argued that the US shared the intelligence to prevent a war, rather than to start one. But the fact is quite the contrary. The fire was lit by the US, and the US has been stoking the fire. After the fire grows, the US made no attempt to end it, but jumped aside, accusing Russia of being the arsonist.Looking back at the constant escalation of the Russia-Ukraine crisis, it is not hard to find out that almost all the information that pushed up the tension on their border came from ""estimates from US intelligent agencies."" And an absurd situation emerged in describing the crisis: Russia and Ukraine were denying fake news, but US, on the other side of the globe, was beating the drum and blowing the trumpet. The US used its powerful public opinion propaganda machine to cover the sound of the parties directly concerned, deliberately ignoring Ukraine's concerns, and forcibly speaking on behalf of Kiev.People have every reason to suspect that US has produced so much ""intelligence"" just to boost NATO's power in EU and seek to pave the way to satisfy its own unbridled strategic greed.If US really wants to cool down the situation, it can just stop leading the NATO in hyping the tension eastward. But after all its efforts, the US did not weaken Russia as it wished. Instead, Ukraine, which the US claimed to ""protect,"" has become the biggest victim: In fear of the outbreak of a war, panic has arisen in Ukraine and wealthy businessmen and officials have started to flee. Violent conflicts in eastern Ukraine have escalated, and the situation at the border is more volatile. But US doesn't care about Ukraine's stability or interests. What it wants is anxiety and chaos in Kiev.The US has been very used to playing the tactics of fighting a public opinion and information war, and it is good at making conceptual shifts and reversing cause and effect. It frequently plays the trick of a thief crying ""Stop thief!"" From the Vietnam War to the Iraq War, then to the Syria War, US intelligence agencies have always been the invisible hand behind US hegemony, and the stories of its dark history are countless. They try to deceive the world with typical telemarketing scam tricks - concocting a scene, misleading the ""victims"" into making wrong judgments, and then asking them to pay for ""protection."" US has long been familiar with weaponizing fake news for its own political gain.In recent years, US has become more obsessed with using false information for political gain. In order to shirk its responsibility, the US has let intelligence agencies be ""in charge"" of COVID-19 origins tracing. To smear other countries, the US has continued to fabricate lies under the guise of ""human rights."" To maintain its hegemony, the US has suppressed enterprises of other countries with various unwarranted reasons. However, as fake news grows, the anti-intellectualism it fosters has also backfired. Under the title of the world's No.1 disinformation country, US society has also become a victim of US's disinformation, and its domestic chaos and diplomatic hysteria are two sides of the same coin.This reminds people of a famous saying: ""You can fool all the people some of the time and some of the people all the time, but you cannot fool all the people all the time."" Just let US politicians make up lies, and they will find out that by stubbornly digging holes for other countries, it is the US' own foundation that will eventually loosen.",OPINION,EDITORIAL,"Russian Army Western Military District tank units wait to be loaded on a troop train on February 18, 2022, as they return from recent routine drills to permanent deployment sites in Novgorod.

51,"World can learn profoundly from February 16, 2022: Global Times editorial",Global Times,2022-02-16," Wednesday, February 16, was the date ""calculated"" by US intelligence agencies on which ""Russia was planning to invade Ukraine"". US President Joe Biden had officially notified the EU and NATO. But what happened ran contrary to the playbook choreographed by the US. As the hands of the clock struck 3 am and Russia announced one day earlier to partly withdraw its troops from the Russia-Ukraine border, the bubble of a Ukraine war crisis, bloated hard by the US and the West, finally burst. Some netizens scoffed, ""The battlefield of the Russia-Ukraine war was changed to an online warfare due to the pandemic. Sorry for the inconvenience."" The world has once again witnessed the shamelessness and absurdity of a group of ""professional screenwriters"" in the US intelligence services. People have also seen the complicated tricks of the US when setting an agenda and mobilizing public opinion. Perhaps this is exactly the ""intelligence"" US politicians need. As the spokesperson of China's Foreign Ministry pointed out on Wednesday, it is exactly the persistent hype and dissemination of disinformation by some in the West that has added more turbulence and uncertainty to the world already fraught with challenges and intensified distrust and division. We hope relevant parties can stop such disinformation campaigns and do more things that benefit peace, mutual trust and cooperation.This ""intelligence farce"" by the US is rare in the current international political narratives. The two sides who are hyped heading into a clash expressed their unwillingness for a war. Russia repeatedly said it won't attack Ukraine, and the latter clarified that the situation hasn't been that tense. Yet the US and West have hyped the imminent war non-stop, and even predicted the precise time when the war will break out. Ukraine suffered a huge loss in the panic atmosphere as exchange rates plummeted, capital fled, and flights were grounded…Recklessly fabricating lies of an ""invasion day"" shows that the US is not afraid of being embarrassed. It believes that with strong discourse power in the world, it can manipulate public opinion at will. In this crisis, the US is playing a game of two-side bets: whether or not Russia invades Ukraine, the US ""wins."" If Russia indeed invades, the US side will say it had expected it long ago and warned repeatedly; if not, the US would say the war was avoided or postponed because of the deterrence of their sanctions.As to why the US made such a farce, everyone can only speculate based on the facts: although the predictions and hype about war from the US are groundless, they have realistic motives. A common saying is that the US wants to make the situation in EU very tense, alienate the relationship between Russia and EU, further strengthen the cohesion of NATO, deal a heavy blow to the EU's ""strategic autonomy"" tendency, and promote the flow of capital to the US, so as to rip off EU.By hyping the Russia threat theory, the US obscures the fact of its increase in troops, diverts the discussion of NATO's eastward expansion, and makes itself a ""guardian"" of regional security and a ""messenger of peace."" As a result, it was clearly a crisis caused by NATO's eastward expansion, but the US and the West made it into a question of whether Russia would invade Ukraine. This is a typical geopolitical maneuver to shift the focus.However, the US' gains come at the expense of others, including its allies and quasi-allies. The US is still the one whose interests come first. This time, the US trapped its quasi-ally Ukraine - by creating war panic, the US made Ukraine suffer hugely. EU also got the short end of the stick. Even if Russia withdraws its troops, there is a serious crack in the trust between Russia and EU.Nonetheless, even if the US manipulates public opinion, it can only fool some people. In the long run, this matter will, like the Iraq war and the Afghan war, further consume US's international credibility that has already been left little. The attitude of Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky has changed significantly. He asked for evidence of Russia's ""invasion"" and complained about the outflow of assets, apparently distrusting the US. More people also know from this matter that running behind the US will not only get no benefit at all, but may also bear consequences.February 16, 2022 has passed, and it will since become a mirror of history, illuminating the real US more clearly and leaving a permanent reflection on the world.",OPINION,EDITORIAL,"A drone carries a Ukrainian National flag above the Independence Square to mark a ""Day of Unity"" in Kyiv on Wednesday.

Photo: AFPAlthough the US previously claimed that Russia planned to attack Ukraine on Wednesday, the day passed peacefully with the recent partial pullback of Russia troops from some border areas, although US and NATO said they did not see the pullback and are insistent on their claims of imminent war to prevent an easing of tensions.Observers pointed out that Russia maintained its strategic composure in dealing with this highly sensitive issue despite some West politicians spouting war rhetoric to hype war risks and media disinformation. US President Joe Biden told allies that Russia would invade on Wednesday. West media, citing officials, even reported the exact attack time is 3am in the early morning. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson brought the topic to China social media platform Sina Weibo on Tuesday, claiming they are at the brink of a cliff and urged Russia to avoid making disastrous decisions, in China. The account of the Russia embassy to China denied any major military action, also in China, and said Downing Street's statement on the ""Russia invasion"" is information terrorism. Ahead of the ""invasion time"" set by the West, Russia on Tuesday announced the withdrawal of troops near the Ukraine borders after completing joint drills with Belarus. The exercises were used by the West to demonstrate Russia's military buildup as an ""invasion preparation."" Russia mocked the claims with Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov saying that Ukrainians who believe such things are welcome to set an alarm and stay up, Russia Today reported. Peskov previously joked that Vladimir Putin sometimes asks him - likewise in jest - if the exact time of the ""invasion"" has been published in the West press.Commenting on the nonexistent ""invasion,"" Russia Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova wrote on Telegram that ""February 15, 2022 will go down in history as the day of the failure of West war propaganda. Humiliated and destroyed without firing a shot."" Yury Tavrovsky, head of the ""Russia Dream-China Dream"" analytic center of the Izborsk Club, told the Global Times on Wednesday that the withdrawal ahead of the predicted invasion puts into question the effectiveness of US and NATO intelligence services. Russia completely took control of the situation and decided whether to bring in or withdraw troops.Having achieved an advantage in offensive weapons, primarily hypersonic missiles, Vladimir Putin got the opportunity to talk to Joe Biden on equal terms and not ""blink first,"" Tavrovsky said, adding that Russia has converted its military-technical achievements into geopolitical ones, and in the foreseeable future, the conversation with the West will be much tougher, Tavrovsky said.Russia's deputy UN envoy Dmitry Polyansky, earlier commenting on White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan's speculation of an alleged Russia invasion at any time, pointed out the US tactic is a clear ""panic campaign,"" TASS reported. The rhetorical bombast was mostly conducted by US politicians, as it wants a war most. The US is eager to use EU anxiety over the Russia presence to fan the hysteria and bind EU tightly to the US' anti-Russia chariot by touting the ""Russia threat,"" Yang Jin, an associate research fellow at the Institute of Russia, EU and Central Asia Studies under the China Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times on Wednesday.  Neither Russia nor EU want to escalate the situation, and the Kremlin has engaged with NATO states diplomatically to control the situation while maintaining a reasonable military presence to show the Russia stance amid the possibility of Ukraine joining NATO, experts said. Tavrovsky noted that Russia has lost practically nothing during the three months of the crisis but won a lot, imposing its agenda on the West and forcing West leaders to line up for meetings with Vladimir Putin and Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov.Vladimir Putin on Tuesday met with Germany Chancellor Olaf Scholz, after West leaders Macron and Boris Johnson. Vladimir Putin told media after the meeting that he does not want to engage in war, TASS reported. Negotiations should lead to ""an agreement to provide equal security for everybody, including our country,"" Vladimir Putin said. Scholz said diplomatic options to avoid war have not been exhausted and the news that some Russia troops are withdrawing from the border area is a good sign.Vladimir Putin repeated that NATO's expansion must not compromise Russia security. According to Vladimir Putin, Russia will not be satisfied with the assurances that Kiev will not join the alliance in the near future because it must be considered what NATO would do ""the day after tomorrow."" Victor Larin, an academician and principal researcher at the Russia Academy of Sciences, told the Global Times that many Russia politicians have lost their former illusions about the decency of the West, and today they do not believe the words of West politicians. That is why the Russia leadership now requires West leaders to put all their proposals and promises on paper.Russia has finally shown itself to be a great power that demands respect for its interests and urges other powers to recognize these interests, the expert said.Alert to troublemaker After Russia announced the troop withdrawal, Joe Biden said the withdrawal was not verified by the US and Russia attack in Ukraine is ""still very much a possibility,"" france24 reported. China Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said at Wednesday's routine press briefing that the US has been playing up the threat of war and creating an air of tension. This has gravely impacted the economy, social stability and people's lives in Ukraine, and added obstacles to advancing dialogue and negotiation between parties concerned.? It is exactly the persistent hyping and dissemination of disinformation by some in the West that has added more turbulence and uncertainty to the world already fraught with challenges and intensified distrust and division, Wang said. China President Xi Jinping, in a Wednesday phone call with Macron, stressed that related parties should stick to the general direction of political settlement of the Ukraine issue.In addition to the US' plotting over the Ukraine crisis and hyping war, observers pointed out a trend that the US-led NATO increasingly puts China on its agenda and tries to involve China into the Ukraine crisis. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg on Tuesday said at a press conference that China and Russia, after further enhancing ties through a joint statement signed ahead of Winter Olympic Games, are ""authoritarian powers"" that do not share their values. US is also mobilizing the Quad, which primarily serves the US' Indo-Pacific Strategy, to target Russia. Amid the West trend of confronting China and Russia together, the two countries are on high alert to real troublemakers and their strategic coordination is based on such a shared stance, observers said.Tavrovsky said the new level of strategic partnership demonstrated during the latest Xi Jinping-Vladimir Putin meeting is a big step forward in curbing the arrogance of the West. Larin believes the two countries should unite efforts in the information war that the West has become adept in, while Yang said it is crucial to set the agenda actively on topics the West frequently attacks, such as affairs related to China's Xinjiang and Hong Kong and the Taiwan question, China experts said. Just as Russia has gained experience in long rivalry against the West, China learns lessons from confrontation with the US and knows how to manage relations with world powers and defend its national interests, China experts said.",CHINA,DIPLOMACY,"Russian President Vladimir Putin (left) and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz meet on Ukraine at the Kremlin, in Moscow, on February 15, 2022.

This is the first gold medal won by the China men's aerials team in 16 years since Han Xiaopeng won the first men's aerials Olympic gold medal at the 2006 Turin Winter Olympic Games.""I did it to let our national flag fly at the top,"" Qi said during an interview after winning the gold. He said that his performance wasn't good enough, and it could have been better. ""The performance today was not the best jump. I was going to set a new record,"" he told the media. ""In fact, I am a little tired today. I can't stand it any longer.

He also offered congratulations on the achievements of France athletes.The two heads of state reached multiple important agreements on bilateral cooperation for the next stage. They agree to push for early implementation of cooperation on agricultural technology and between agricultural industries with local advantages. China encourages more France agrifood enterprises that meet China's requirements to register in China.They also agreed to deepen the China-France green manufacturing partnership initiative. Besides, efforts will be made to support more France banks and financial infrastructure in joining the RMB Cross-Border Interbank Payment System.

55,China-EU business competition does not exclude possibility of cooperation in Africa,George N. Tzogopoulos,2022-02-17,"The leaders of the EU and the Africa Union (AU) will meet for the sixth EU - Africa Union summit in Brussels on Thursday and Friday. The summit is ambitious and covers sectors such as climate change, growth financing, migration, peace and education. More investment schemes will be revealed during the summit.Africa is critically important for EU due to geographical and historical reasons. Developments in this continent are capturing the attention of the EU, which views its expanding international role as catalytic for securing stability and fostering prosperity. The EU values stability in Africa. From a EU perspective, instability in Africa (in North Africa and Sub-Saharan Africa) can be exported toward the Mediterranean posing serious problems, including terrorism. Additionally, EU is seeking to prevent new waves of refugees, although it is characterized by an ageing population, while that of Africa is younger and more dynamic. Furthermore, the EU is interested in importing more liquefied natural gas (LNG) from Africa countries such as Nigeria, an issue which has been prioritized in recent weeks due to the Russia-Ukraine tensions. Prior to the meeting, the EU revealed a 150-billion euro investment package for Africa, which is the first investment plan under its Global Gateway scheme. Investments will focus on objectives based on the green transition. There will also be support for sustainable agri-food systems. Efforts will also focus on sustainable growth and job creation.China has been certainly a critical player in Africa. According to a report by the Center for Global Development, China tops the foreign financing for basic infrastructure in Africa. Its two main overseas development banks invested $23 billion in infrastructure projects on the continent, more than the other top eight lenders combined, including the World Bank, Africa Development Bank, and US and EU development banks. Business competition between China and the EU is not new and will perhaps intensify in a changing world. Such competition, however, does not exclude the possibility of some partnerships. Dialogue is essential. The Joint Statement of the 20th China-EU Summit (2018) mentions that the two sides would strengthen exchanges on Africa. They both agree on the importance of eradicating poverty and support the Africa Union's Agenda 2063. Thus, the EU's Global Gateway can complement the China-proposed Belt and Road Initiative, notwithstanding clashing business interests. While the Global Gateway, which EU claims representing its contribution to narrowing global investment gap, focuses more on mobilizing capital, the Belt and Road Initiative can immediately lead to the flow of capital. Cooperation is possible. For example, global players, including China and the EU, created a debt service suspension initiative to temporarily assist poor countries. COVID-19 pandemic has also demonstrated that problems are transnational. China and the EU, for instance, are collaborating in providing vaccines to the developing world (including in Africa) through COVAX. Synergies can be cemented in other sectors. Multilateral initiatives and peacekeeping operations under the UN umbrella are valuable, where the EU and China can also cooperate.It is of vital importance to ensure that business competition would not take a confrontational dimension but would meet prosperity expectations of Africa citizens themselves. The contribution of both toward this end remains the desired goal. The author is a lecturer at the EU Institute in Nice, France. opinion@globaltimes.com.cn",SOURCE,ECONOMY,Illustration：Tang Tengfei/GT,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'EU': ('ORG', 14), 'Africa Union': ('ORG', 3), 'AU': ('ORG', 1), 'Center for Global Development': ('ORG', 1), 'World Bank': ('ORG', 1), 'Africa Development Bank': ('ORG', 1), 'Gateway': ('ORG', 2), 'Brussels': ('LOC', 1), 'Africa': ('LOC', 10), 'North Africa': ('LOC', 11), 'Sub - Saharan Africa': ('LOC', 11), 'Mediterranean': ('LOC', 1), 'Nigeria': ('LOC', 1), 'Russia': ('LOC', 1), 'Ukraine': ('LOC', 1), 'China': ('LOC', 5), 'US': ('LOC', 1), 'Global Gateway': ('MISC', 1), 'Summit': ('MISC', 1), 'Belt': ('MISC', 2), 'Initiative': ('MISC', 2)}"
56,China and Russia the bastions of multipolar world that breaks US dominance,Lü Xiang,2022-02-17,"As Russia philosopher and political analyst Aleksandr Dugin says, the unipolar world, globalist ideology, and West hegemony are collapsing, and the US doesn't want to sit idly by. US is willing to take any action to stop this from happening. Thus the problem of Ukraine arose when the US declared an ""impending Russia invasion.""However, the current Ukraine crisis is not essentially a Russia-Ukraine problem, but a US-EU one. The US instigation of the Ukraine crisis aims at killing two birds with one stone, cracking down on Russia and stabilizing NATO. As nowadays the EU members of NATO are increasingly alienated from the US, the US needs to take advantage of the Ukraine crisis to divide Russia and EU, consolidate NATO and enhance US' control over the organization. As a result, the EU countries would have to strengthen NATO as well as the transatlantic alliance. In addition to Ukraine, there are a lot of other leverages available for the US in EU. Small countries like Lithuania can be easily controlled and used by the US. The US is more concerned about the lack of compliance by large countries like Germany and France, which could lead to the EU-US relations derailing from the current track. That's the reason why the US is desperately trying to screw up the Nord Stream-2 gas pipeline project and stop Germany and Russia from forming some kind of economic partnership. What the US has done in EU to target Russia is similar in nature to its anti-China operations in the Asia-Pacific region. The US pursuit of globalism since World War II has essentially been a desire for maintaining a world in which it has the upper hand. At present, the US is trying to expand its circle of friends, while excluding only China and Russia. This is because, in the US' view, only these two powers have the ability to protect their sovereignty.  Ultimately, the US does not want another dominant country to emerge outside North US. China is the world's second-largest economy and has sufficient military defense capabilities, while Russia is a formidable military power with a vast territory and plentiful resources. Meanwhile, the high degree of strategic coherence between China and Russia would be the envy of all historically aligned countries. The partnership between China and Russia is not an alliance. But the two offer solid support to each other politically and economically. With deep and stable political, economic and security cooperation, China and Russia will ensure that there is more than one pole in the world, inspiring other countries to do their best to become fully sovereign.Because the US understands the power of China and Russia, it has been trying to tell a story of ""evil China and Russia uniting to pose threats to the world"" and constantly touting the ""threats"" of China-Russia cooperation. The US used to believe that Russia would assimilate with EU in the manner it preferred after the disintegration of the Soviet Union, but the reality turns out to be a different story. This has made the US uneasy and its anxieties further increased with the rise of China as a civilization different from the West. As a result, there is the inevitable demonization of China and Russia. This, however, makes no sense as nothing can stop China's development or the friendship between China and Russia. The China-Russia relationship has become the cornerstone of multi-polar international order. The unipolar era was only a fleeting illusion for a decade or so after the Cold War, but the US still seeks to maintain it. Nonetheless, China and Russia exist as two bastions in the world that the US cannot break through, which is a basic guarantee of a multipolar world. The author is a research fellow at the China Academy of Social Sciences. opinion@globaltimes.com.cn",OPINION,VIEWPOINT,Illustration: Chen Xia/GT,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'Russia': ('LOC', 12), 'West': ('LOC', 1), 'Ukraine': ('LOC', 6), 'Lithuania': ('LOC', 1), 'Germany': ('LOC', 2), 'France': ('LOC', 1), 'China': ('LOC', 6), 'Asia': ('LOC', 1), 'Pacific': ('LOC', 1), 'North US': ('LOC', 19), 'Aleksandr Dugin': ('PER', 1), 'EU': ('ORG', 7), 'NATO': ('ORG', 4), 'Nord Stream - 2': ('MISC', 1), 'anti': ('MISC', 1), 'World War II': ('MISC', 1)}"
57,Bitcoin runs into Russian rules and regiments,Reuters,2022-02-17,"Bristling tensions and looming laws in EU could offer clues to two questions: Can Bitcoin be a safe-haven asset? And can Russia emerge as a crypto superpower?The answer to the first, for now at least, is no; while fortress gold has risen 2.3 percent over the past week, as West warnings about Russia aggression have intensified, Bitcoin has lost 3 percent. That was worse than the 0.9 percent decline of the Nasdaq Composite index.""I don't see any evidence of Bitcoin being a safe haven,"" said Chris Weston, head of research at Melbourne-based brokerage Pepperstone. ""The Ukraine situation with Russia is a really hard one to price, so in that situation, you just buy crude futures.""Yet it's too early to dismiss the argument made by many Bitcoin advocates who say the cryptocurrency, just into its teens, is destined to be a form of digital gold that should retain its value when riskier assets such as stocks tumble.While Bitcoin has slipped towards levels of around $42,000 in recent days, it hasn't surrendered all the gains made from lows of $32,950 hit on January 24.Bitcoin's average 30-day volatility has fallen to 3.48 percent, versus its 2021 average of 4.56 percent, according to BuyBitcoinWorldwide's volatility index.Data platform Coinglass' Bitcoin Fear & Greed index, which measures market sentiment - 0 indicates extreme fear and 100 is extreme greed - stands at 46, above the nervy 11-33 range where it had been trading since late November.Matthew Dibb, chief operating officer of Singapore-based crypto platform Stack Funds, said he was bullish on crypto in the longer term as an alternative asset and a hedge to world events - ""But not quite yet.""""We are beginning to see some discorrelation between Bitcoin and the equities market, which is very nice,"" he added. ""But while we're seeing some traditional safe havens pop off with the Ukraine and Russia situation, we haven't really seen that in crypto.""Crypto superpowersMeanwhile: A new law for crypto assets expected to be announced in Russia this week could potentially shape the global scene.Russia's importance for cryptocurrencies has been growing over the past year after a ban on Bitcoin mining in China, previously the world's dominant centre for the activity, sent miners scrambling for alternatives. Russia had become the third-largest centre for Bitcoin mining in the world as of last August, according to data from UK's Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance.US accounts for the largest share of mining, about 42.7 percent of the global ""hashrate"" - the computing power being used by computers connected to the Bitcoin network - followed by Kazakhstan and Russia with 18.1 percent and 11.2 percent respectively.Some industry watchers believe Russia might have since overtaken Kazakhstan, where miners have contended with government internet shutdowns during unrest this year.  It remains unclear, though, what the Russia regulations will hold.Last week authorities said they were working on rules that would allow cryptocurrency purchases to take place, but only through locally registered and licensed companies. Industry players saw this as a positive development after the central bank had proposed banning the use and mining of cryptocurrencies in January.Russia Deputy Finance Minister Alexei Moiseev said on Monday that ensuring that money flows and crypto transactions could be traced was crucial, including being able to identify users. If included in the draft law, that may diminish one of cryptocurrencies' major selling points - their anonymity.Moiseev also told reporters that banks and exchanges, required to comply with anti-money laundering laws, would be the only legal entry point for crypto into the Russia market.Reuters",SOURCE,ECONOMY,Bitcoin Photo: CFP,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'EU': ('ORG', 1), 'Pepperstone': ('ORG', 1), 'BuyBitcoinWorldwide': ('ORG', 1), 'Coinglass': ('ORG', 1), 'Stack Funds': ('ORG', 1), 'Bitco': ('MISC', 7), 'Nasdaq Composite': ('MISC', 1), 'Melbourne': ('MISC', 1), 'Singapore': ('MISC', 1), 'Russia': ('LOC', 5), 'West': ('LOC', 1), 'Ukraine': ('LOC', 2), 'Chris Weston': ('PER', 1), 'Matthew Dibb': ('PER', 1)}"

We urge everyone to get involved into dialogue.

61,China honors Olympic values in hosting Winter Games,George N. Tzogopoulos,2022-02-16,"Beijing has become the first city in the world to host both the Summer and Winter Olympic Games. The Beijing Winter Olympic Games are being organized under difficult circumstances due to the continuation of COVID-19 pandemic and regional instability around Ukraine. Their diachronic symbolism finds thus resonance. Sports practiced without discrimination can function as an education model in building a better and more peaceful world. It is impossible to understand the true spirit of Olympism, in other words, the philosophy of the Winter Olympic Games, without referring to the history of Greece. The first Winter Olympic Games took place in 776 BC in the Greek city of Olympia. Their first version lasted until AD 393 and was connected to the so-called Olympic truce. This meant that all conflicts had to cease for an agreed period of a few days or weeks in order for athletes, artists, and spectators to safely travel. The sacred truce was a necessary prerequisite for the organization of the Games. In his The History of the Peloponnesian War, Thucydides narrates an interesting incident. In book V, as Thucydides writes, the Lacedaemonians were excluded from the temple by the Eleans, and could neither sacrifice nor contend in the Games. The reason was that they had refused to pay the fine which, according to Olympic law, the Eleans had imposed upon them, alleging that they had brought an armed force against the fortress of Phyrcus, and had introduced some hoplites of their own into Lepreum during the Olympic truce. China showcased its respect for history and the role of Greece in the genesis of the Olympic values by adding special elements to the 2022 opening ceremony. In particular, a choir of 40 China children sang the Olympic anthem in fluent Greek. This hymn, with lyrics by the famous Greek poet Kostis Palamas, was performed in 1896 when the modern version of the Winter Olympic Games was inaugurated at its birthplace. It was declared the official anthem decades later, in 1958. For his part, President of the International Olympic Committee Thomas Bach referred to the Olympic truce UN resolution in his speech during the opening ceremony. This resolution was adopted by the consensus of all 193 UN member states. Bach also appealed to all political authorities across the world to observe their commitment to this Olympic truce. Fourteen years after the Beijing Summer Olympics, China comes again to the epicenter of world attention. It has the responsibility to organize safe Games for athletes and spectators and disseminate messages in the true spirit of Olympism. The need for international cooperation of all parts of the world and all nations without exception - as the Olympic rings and their colors denote -will be subsequently underlined.China today is different in comparison to its 2008 self. It is more robust, prosperous and confident but preserves the same appetite to continuously succeed. Planning and hard work, the result of which has been already evident during the Beijing 2022 Olympics, are a characteristic ingredient of how the country works.

62,GT Voice: US’ warmongering in Ukraine is only for wartime profiteering,Global Times,2022-02-16,"US predictions that Wednesday would be the date of a Russia military campaign against Ukraine didn't materialize as of press time, but that hasn't seemed to stop the US from issuing war-related warnings aimed at further inflaming regional tensions.US President Joe Biden said in an address on Tuesday that ""an invasion remains distinctly possible."" His remarks came just several hours after Russia's defense ministry said that a grouping of troops near Ukraine are returning to their bases after completing military drills, a development that has been widely seen as an apparent sign of de-escalation of tensions between Russia and Ukraine.It is rather clear that both Russia and Ukraine have no intention of eagerly going to war, but US, with its dramatic warnings and performance art, has still been trying to make the world believe that World War III is imminent. That only makes sense if the US has much to gain from such a dire scenario, and it does indeed.Behind the US' hysteric hype about a potential war in Ukraine are its intentions of satisfying the voracious appetite of its military-industrial complex, which stands to gain the most from a potential war. That's why US officials are sparing no efforts in misleading Russia and Ukraine into a military conflict.If a war breaks out, the Russia economy would face enormous sanction pressure from the West, while Ukraine would also suffer. And the US would end up being the biggest beneficiary of the war. Particularly, US defense contractors and arms makers stand to gain the most from any conflict in EU.The US has provoked more wars than any other country since the World War II. Whenever there was a military campaign, the US military-industrial complex made a fortune. Even if the Ukraine war doesn't break out, vested interest groups in the US defense sector have still got business opportunities from regional tensions. They don't even care to hide their greed. For instance, Raytheon CEO Greg Hayes said in late January he saw a potential war over Ukraine and security risks as ""opportunities for international sales."" Beyond the boost for a US arms sales, even though a war has not occurred as the US repeatedly warned, continuing tensions in EU have already precipitated capital outflows to the US financial market, which is of great help for the US economy, which is grappling with a series of self-inflicted woes. Due to skyrocketing inflation, expectations for interest rate increases by the US Fed have been on the rise, piling up pressure on the US' debt and stock markets. If the US capital market runs short of liquidity amid a tightening monetary policy, there is a risk of systemic economic crisis in the US. Against this backdrop, the US' attempt to instigate a conflict in EU cannot be a coincidence. Because only by attracting global capital flows to its home turf can the US bond prices be stabilized and the US economy survive.Fundamentally speaking, US foreign policy has been hijacked by the vested interest groups in the defense sector that is relentlessly and recklessly pursuing huge profits from bloody wars. Without war, the US military-industrial complex would be a huge financial burden given the already high US fiscal deficits. The US needs wars in the rest of the world to support its military-industrial complex.Such greed is not only deplorable but also dangerous to the world. The US government, as powerful as it seems, appears to have been hijacked by these interest groups, but the world cannot afford to allow them to continue profit from misfortunes around the globe. Vigilance is required and hopefully will help form a formidable counterforce to such evil deeds.",SOURCE,GT VOICE,Joe Biden Photo: AFP,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'US': ('LOC', 17), 'Russia': ('LOC', 6), 'Ukraine': ('LOC', 9), 'West': ('LOC', 1), 'Joe Biden': ('PER', 1), 'Ray': ('PER', 1), 'Greg Hayes': ('PER', 1), 'World War III': ('MISC', 1), 'World War II': ('MISC', 1), 'EU': ('ORG', 2), 'Fed': ('ORG', 1)}"
63,US appears to be threatening another tariff war with China despite mounting losses,Cong Ge,2022-02-16,"After the US ended its 20-year war in Afghanistan in an embarrassment of epic proportions last August, many Monday morning quarterbacks in US excoriated the flaws in the US campaign from start to end and seemed adamant about avoiding endless wars. However, less than six months after its haphazard escape from Afghanistan, the US is running its warmongering machine is in full throttle again inciting a war with Russia. And US's itch for war goes beyond borders between Ukraine and Russia to an escalated trade war with China.  As the US has spared no effort in instigating a war between Russia and Ukraine over the past several weeks - predicting a ""Russia invasion"" would occur on Wednesday, deploying thousands of US troops to East EU and evacuating its diplomats from Ukraine, global attention has been fixated on tensions on the Russia-Ukraine border. However, with significantly less global focus and domestic scrutiny, US is also pushing for an expanded trade war with China. For months, US media outlets and think-tanks have been accusing China of failing to meet its commitment under the phase one trade agreement to purchase more US agricultural, energy and other products. That campaign has escalated over the last month or so, as US officials have also made lurid claims against China over the implementation of the agreement. In a clear sign of escalation, US now appears to be talking about further expanding the multi-year trade war against China under pretext that China did not carry out the phase one deal. Citing people familiar with the matter, Bloomberg reported on Tuesday that US officials were running out of patience after ""months of talks"" with China officials over the ""shortfalls"" in the phase one deal and were considering steps to respond. Among the measures considered by US President Joe Biden's administration is a so-called Section 301 investigation into China's industrial policies that could result in extra tariffs and restrictions on China investments, according to Bloomberg. The motive behind such signals out of US might be pressuring and forcing China into making further concessions, but make no mistake, such rhetoric is a threat of an expanded trade war against China. Imposing punitive tariffs, in particular, was how Joe Biden's predecessor Donald Trump launched the trade war several years ago. Joe Biden, who previously blasted Donald Trump's trade war approach, now appears poised to scale up the war instead of deescalating. As the US economy grapples with severe inflationary pressure, which, in addition to its money printing during COVID-19 pandemic, is also a result of US tariffs on hundreds of billions of worth of China products, it's really mindboggling that the Joe Biden administration is considering imposing more tariffs on China products. But given the US' overall hostility toward China and insatiable taste for war and conflicts, this move is also not so surprising.As far as China is concerned, its long-held approach of pursuing consultations and safeguarding its core development interests will unlikely change, no matter how the Joe Biden administration changes its approach. In other words, China remains open to consultations with the US to address each other's concerns on the basis of equality and mutual respect; however, if the US takes illegal actions that hurt China's interests, China will do whatever necessary to protect its legitimate rights and interests. US should be clear about that by now after the multi-year trade war. However, considering the US' rapidly weakening position both at home and abroad, it's more likely than not that the threats of more tariffs and sanctions against China is just a pressure tactic. The Joe Biden administration lacks the political will to wage another tariff war against China due to the lack of public support. The US government is already facing mounting calls and even lawsuits from the US business community to drop existing tariffs on China goods. If the Joe Biden administration were to impose more tariffs, not just China but the US business community will also likely respond swiftly. In any event, whatever tactic the US is pulling, it will not work on China. Whereas the US ended the Afghan war no matter how messy and costly it was, it is still bearing the brunt of the tariff war against China. The Joe Biden administration is wise not increase that self-inflicted pain and remain seated at the negotiating table to address trade issues before waging another endless, costly and embarrassing war for itself. The author is an editor with the Global Times. bizopinion@globaltimes.com.cn",SOURCE,ECONOMY,Illustration: Tang Tengfei/GT,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'US': ('LOC', 16), 'Afghanistan': ('LOC', 2), 'Russia': ('LOC', 5), 'Ukraine': ('LOC', 4), 'China': ('LOC', 11), 'East EU': ('LOC', 1), 'Bloomberg': ('ORG', 2), 'Joe Biden': ('PER', 3), 'Donald Trump': ('PER', 2), 'Section 301': ('MISC', 1)}"
64,"Semiconductors, food supplies at risk amid elusive situation in Europe",GT staff reporters,2022-02-15,"The escalation of Russia-Ukraine tensions stoked by the US has raised concerns about potential supply chain disruptions ranging from essential raw materials for semiconductors such as neon, to agricultural products including corn and wheat, of which Ukraine has been a major world exporter.While the elusive situation in EU has pushed up oil and other commodity prices and risked further disruption to global semiconductor supplies, which remain tight due to the pandemic and US-initiated trade wars, China companies have started reviewing their supply chains to reduce operational risks.Ukraine is a major supplier of semiconductor raw material gases, including neon, argon, krypton and xenon. Ukraine supplies nearly 70 percent of the world's neon gas, according to a report that TrendForce, an industry information consulting company, sent to the Global Times on Tuesday.In the semiconductor lithography process, the process that requires neon gas is mainly DUV exposure for the production of 8 to 12-inch wafers.Although the proportion of neon gas used in the semiconductor process is not as high as in other industries, it is still a necessary input, experts said.In terms of foundries, global 8-12-inch wafer production capacity accounts for about 75 percent of the total, according to TrendForce.While supplies of inert gases such as neon would be reduced in volume in the region, potentially pushing up prices of downstream products including semiconductors, the production lines will not be interrupted to an extent that affects output in the short term, since both wafer factories and gas supply factories have inventories and diversified sources of supplies, according to TrendForce.Ma Yinchuan, head of the China Industrial Gases Industry Association, told the Global Times on Tuesday that at present, there is not much problem of inadequate neon supply.In addition to helium, there is no serious shortage of China's inert gases, including neon now, but there will be tight supplies and prices will rise, especially if countries such as Japan and South Korea increase imports of neon from China amid the tensions in EU, even though the production of neon gas can be improved through government mobilization if it is needed, Ma said.In addition to neon gas, Ukrain supplies 40 percent of the world's krypton and 30 percent of xenon - both are important materials in semiconductor-related production. Experts said that if supplies are cut off, it will further exacerbate domestic shortages.Other than raw materials for making chips, both Russia and Ukraine are major exporters of wheat, corn and oilseeds, so grain trade has been affected now.Russia's wheat exports account for 20 percent of the world's total, making it the world's largest wheat exporter, while Ukraine's wheat exports account for 10 percent, making it the fifth-largest world exporter, according to media reports.""Imports of Ukraine grain continue. Up to now, no impact has been seen in shipments,"" a procurement manager with a major grain trader told the Global Times on Tuesday. ""However, there has been a considerable rise in prices.""As traders, we are not comfortable with this situation,"" the manager said on condition of anonymity.Analysts cited by a CNN report are eyeing wheat prices to rise to $11 per bushel, the highest since 2008, from the current level of $7.93. For corn, the rise would be from $6.47 to $8 per bushel.Ukraine is also the fourth-largest corn exporter in the world, accounting for about 16 percent of global exports. In 2021, China imported 28.35 million tons of corn, including 8.23 million tons of Ukraine corn, accounting for about 29 percent of China's total corn imports.""Now, some China traders are more cautious when signing corn orders sourced from Ukraine,"" Meng Jinhui, an agriculture industry analyst, told the Global Times on Tuesday.In recent days, the US has played up tensions between Russia and Ukraine while stoking fears of a Russia ""invasion,"" according to media reports.Given the circumstances, it is not a responsible behavior to hype up war, and to advocate group confrontation is to go back to the old path of the Cold War, China's Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said on Tuesday, in response to media questions about Russia-Ukraine tensions.Wang urged all parties to be rational and refrain from making moves that may escalate the tensions and sensationalize the crisis.",SOURCE,ECONOMY,"A view of Kiev, Ukraine Photo: Unsplash",Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'Russia': ('MISC', 1), 'Ma': ('MISC', 1), 'Ukraine': ('LOC', 4), 'US': ('LOC', 2), 'China': ('LOC', 3), 'Japan': ('LOC', 1), 'South Korea': ('LOC', 1), 'EU': ('ORG', 2), 'TrendForce': ('ORG', 3), 'Global Times': ('ORG', 2), 'China Industrial Gases Industry Association': ('ORG', 1), 'Ma Yinchuan': ('PER', 1)}"
65,World needs to reject US’ evil script in Asia and Europe,Hu Xijin,2022-02-15,"The situation in Ukraine has almost hit a boiling point. US President Joe Biden told its EU allies that Russia forces could attack Ukraine on February 16, namely tomorrow. The US also announced the temporary closure of its embassy in Kiev and the evacuation of a small number of diplomats to the Ukraine city of Lviv. Many of Ukraine's wealthy fled on private jets. Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky has proclaimed Feb. 16 as ""Unity Day"", when flags are to be raised and the national anthem to be played. Russia denounced the ""hysteria"" in the West about an ""impending Russia invasion"" as ""absurd."" The situation is confusing. The world will keep watching the situation in Ukraine. Tomorrow is Feb. 16, and if Russia does not attack on that date, it will be a slap on the face of US intelligence agencies and President Joe Biden will be the biggest maker and purveyor of rumors. The Ukraine issue alone already frustrates the West. However, recently West public opinion has been linking the situation in Ukraine into the Taiwan question, claiming that if Russia succeeds in Ukraine, the China mainland will follow suit to win over Taiwan and may even take action against Taiwan at the same time. A recent statement by Australia Defense Minister Peter Dutton put the Ukraine issue side by side with the Taiwan question, and West parliamentarians and media have made similar analyses. The Taiwan authority has set up a so-called special task force to study the impact of the situation in Ukraine on Taiwan's security. Taiwan leader Tsai Ing-wen claimed that ""Taiwan has faced military threats and intimidation from China for a long time"" and "" we empathize with Ukraine's situation.""Such clamor equates Taiwan's political status with that of Ukraine. As we all know, Taiwan is an inalienable part of China, and one China is internationally recognized. Even in the US' anti-China public opinion system, Taiwan's status has been vaguely dealt with.There are only a dozen tiny countries supporting Taiwan's so-called sovereignty. The goal of those extreme anti-China forces is to elevate the global strategic influence of the Taiwan question and expand and intensify the participation of the whole West on the Taiwan question. Furthermore, they have deeper intents. The US is now relatively in decline in terms of national power, and its control over EU and the Asia-Pacific is waning. Against this backdrop, it attempts to gradually disrupt EU and Asia on the grounds of providing security support to the two regions, and then reap the benefits.It is noticeable that by insisting on NATO's eastward expansion and refusing to provide security guarantees to Russia, the US position is much tougher than that of EU powers like France and Germany. Most EU countries are now very worried, and EU leaders have been in constant contact with the Kremlin, in a bid to deescalate the situation. France President Emmanuel Macron also said that ""There is no security for Europeans if there is no security for Russia."" It clearly diverts from US's tone.The one country which is least afraid of seeing EU trapped in chaos is the US. Once EU falls in disturbances, its capital will go to the US and EU countries will have to follow the US more closely on security issue, and the Nord Stream 2 Pipeline project may also be ruined in that scenario. The US is playing a big calculative game in EU. It is the same in Asia. The US cannot stop China's rise, so it is committed to messing up the region. One of its tactics is stirring up troubles on the Taiwan question, and territorial disputes between China and its neighbors. US has been trying to hype up the confrontation in the region. After former US President Donald Trump took office, he made China the number one strategic competitor of the US and launched the Indo-Pacific Strategy. In the past few years, the Taiwan question has lost its flexibility, and the Tsai Ing-wen authority has completely turned to the US and become hostile to the China mainland.As China-India relations deteriorate, the border issue between the two countries has become intractable. Australia has adopted a hostile policy toward China, while Japan has gotten increasingly tough toward China. Who can say if there is no connection between these changes, or that the US is not the one pushing these countries from behind?The outbreak of war in either Ukraine or the Taiwan Straits will be very destructive. Neither Russia nor China wants to break the current stalemate through war. One could argue that a war would not benefit the US either. Such an analysis is based on common sense. Yet, an extreme fever of a cold war has been formed in the US political and public opinion communities. Thus, rationality no longer dominates US policy in EU and the Asia-Pacific, and extremism is becoming more and more popular.The extreme elites of the US don't fear chaos in the world. They think no matter how turbulent EU and Asia are, the US will be suffering the least. US has repeatedly stated that once a war breaks out in Ukraine, the US troops will not be part of it. On the Taiwan question, the US hasn't promised to send troops if there is a war in the Taiwan Straits. Thus, the US has no bottom line as it incites regional radicalism and extremism, forcing Russia to attack, and pushing China to make strong responses. The biggest destroyer of world peace is the US. The Taiwan authorities will eventually become cannon fodder if they blindly follow the US. The EU and Asia countries, without a sober understanding, will fall into a trap, serving as the strategic stepping stones for US or even as its grindstone. The world needs to jointly reject the US' evil script. The countries' shared future should not be ruined by US.",OPINION,VIEWPOINT,"US troops deploy for Europe from Pope Army Airfield at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, on February 3, 2022.

66,Washington’s Pacific islands tilt stems from pure self-interest: Global Times editorial,Global Times,2022-02-14,"US Secretary of State Antony Blinken flew from Australia to Fiji on Saturday and met virtually with leaders of 17 Pacific island nations. Antony Blinken announced the US would reopen its embassy on the Solomon Islands and pledged more US help on issues of concern to Pacific island countries, such as climate change.  But almost all West media outlets covering the trip have noted one thing - Antony Blinken's trip was to counter China's influence. It has been seen that Pacific island countries have been unilaterally counted in the geopolitical map of conflict and confrontation by US out of the latter's strategic selfishness. One day earlier, the White House released a document titled ""Indo-Pacific Strategy of the US."" It claims the US will ""meaningfully expand our diplomatic presence in Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands,"" ""be a partner in strengthening democratic institutions,"" and ""work with allies and partners to… develop and deploy advanced warfighting capabilities."" Obviously, when the US intervenes in this region, it brings as usual the two rusty axes of ""US democracy"" and ""military might,"" with the illusion that the US can cut the Pacific Ocean and make the region whatever shape the US wants.As always, Antony Blinken did not forget to sow discord in the region. At a joint press conference in Fiji, Antony Blinken kept exaggerating the Russia threat to Ukraine, and repeatedly emphasized the ""coercion"" the free and open Indo-Pacific region faced. But what concerns Pacific island leaders the most is how to tackle climate change. When it comes to this issue, the US is really not a reliable partner. During the press conference, the Acting Prime Minister of Fiji Aiyaz Sayed-Khaiyum put it bluntly, ""When the US signaled its intent to leave the Paris Agreement, we felt forgotten by a superpower.""For a long time, the US was void of steady interest in Pacific island countries, and it will only look down and notice the region whenever there is a strategic need. The US Embassy in the Solomon Islands has been closed for 29 years. The position of US ambassador to Fiji is still vacant. This time, it is the Embassy's chargé d'affaires who welcomed Antony Blinken's ""historical visit."" Antony Blinken is the first US secretary of state to visit Fiji in 37 years. If it wasn't for the deep strategic anxiety, US would not think of Pacific island countries for another 37 years.The US intends to return to the Pacific region, without concerning itself with what the island countries really need. After the catastrophic volcanic eruption in Tonga, although the US and Australia, as neighbors, were the loudest ones who claimed to provide aid, the first supplies that arrived in Tonga came from China. Now Antony Blinken goes to these countries and warns them that China is dangerous, instead of talking about bilateral cooperation and livelihood development. Don't these countries know clearly who is helping them and who is using them as tools? Do they still need US to teach them?Unlike the fact that the US secretary of state took 37 years to think of Fiji, more than 20 China officials at the level of foreign minister or higher have visited the country since 1985. Today, China is the second-largest trading partner of Pacific island countries. On the issue of climate change, which is of concern to Pacific island countries, China is not only committed to its words and will take the shortest time to achieve carbon neutrality from the peak of carbon emissions, but also provides assistance within the framework of South-South cooperation, for the island countries to enhance their capacity to deal with climate change. What is particularly important is that China's relations with Pacific island countries have always been open, transparent, inclusive and not targeted at any third party. The US claims that the Indo-Pacific should be free and open, but it has imposed its security anxiety on the Pacific island countries, injected conflicts, confrontation and insecurity in the region. As it turns out, the aid for the purpose of geopolitical competition is more about satisfying the US strategic demands. In Africa, for example, there has been little sincere cashing in terms of US promises to Africa, from the Obama administration's ""Power Africa"" initiative, to the ""Prosperous Africa"" initiative launched by the Donald Trump administration and the recent ""Build Back Better"" plan of the Joe Biden administration. Over the years, US investment in Africa has declined rather than risen. Now, when the US abruptly thinks of Pacific island countries, people there are most concerned about how soon ""Mr. Antony Blinken's visit and promises will lead to measurable results."" Based on past experience, however, there is reason to worry that US is ultimately setting off fireworks in the Pacific just for its own pleasure, and that others will probably only get to hear the sound.",OPINION,EDITORIAL,US Secretary of State Antony Blinken speaks during a press conference with Fijian Acting Prime Minister Aiyaz Sayed-Khaiyum during his visit to Fiji on Saturday.

69,Speculative India uses megaphone diplomacy to seek intl support for border row with China,Qian Feng,2022-02-14,"Addressing a joint news conference in Melbourne after a bilateral meeting with his Australia counterpart on Saturday, India External Affairs Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar criticized China for ""disregarding"" the ""written agreements"" with India in regard to the current situation of the Line of Actual Control (LAC), and said it is ""an issue of legitimate concern for the entire international community."" Jaishankar paid a visit to Australia from Thursday to Sunday, during which he attended the 4th Quad foreign ministers' meeting along with counterparts from Australia, Japan and the US.Such rhetoric echoes India's stubborn stance since the Galwan Valley clash between China and India in 2020. Although Beijing and New Delhi have reached a consensus to settle the boundary dispute through bilateral dialogue and consultation, India has not changed its unreasonable demands, and is piling more pressure on China on some multilateral issues, hoping to gain support from anti-China forces in countries like the US and Australia. New Delhi may believe this can help increase its leverage in negotiating with China over the border disputes.India cannot realize its intention in this regard. The root of its confrontations with China is India's infrastructure construction in disputed border areas for the purpose of military surveillance. Ignoring this fact, India seems to have engaged in megaphone diplomacy in the international community. But no matter how noisy it is, it cannot change the fact that it is India which is responsible for the deterioration of China-India relations, and thereby will fail to gain support from the international community.Furthermore, India regards itself as a major power and repeatedly reiterated that it is against third-party mediation in its talks with China. But New Delhi's discussion with Canberra over its border issue with Beijing seems to go against India's position. India may realize its comprehensive strength is still way behind that of China. And it will not get its expected result on its own. But its attempt to gain support from a third party will backfire, and be detrimental to the settlement of India's disputes with China.These sharp remarks against China from Jaishankar, who ""is usually very diplomatic in his choice of words, especially on China, more so while speaking from foreign soil,"" ""reflect Delhi's frustration over Beijing's behaviour ever since the start of the military standoff along the Ladakh frontier in May 2020,"" India Express commented. The word ""frustration"" is not accurate here. Instead, Jaishankar's hard-line rhetoric is more like anger from embarrassment as New Delhi's unreasonable demands over the border disputes with China cannot be met.It is noticeable that a day ahead of Jaishankar's tough remarks, the White House issued its new Indo-Pacific Strategy, which said that the US will strengthen ""relationships with leading regional partners, including India"" and will support ""India's continued rise and regional leadership.""The US' holding of a Quad foreign ministers' meeting and announcing its Indo-Pacific Strategy amid the Winter Olympic Games has clearly taken China as a target. Jaishankar must have clearly known that his sharp words would have a negative impact on India's relations with China. His insistence on dancing with the US, Japan and Australia demonstrates India's stance on moving closer to the Quad mechanism in regards to issues on China. This is also a kind of diplomatic balancing act after Russia-India relations were heated up by Russia President Vladimir Putin's visit to India in December, making the US unhappy.These practices embody India's speculative mentality in terms of diplomacy. US pushed a Quad foreign ministers' meeting amid the Ukraine crisis and mentioned the importance of India in its new Indo-Pacific Strategy. The Joe Biden administration's emphasis over the Indo-Pacific region has not declined because of the changes of the EU situation. It may ease New Delhi's distrust over the US because of US's withdrawal from Afghanistan.India will take advantage of the relationship among China, the US and Russia to seek a favorable position out of such a speculative mentality. Between China and the US, India will continue to pursue a dynamic balance. New Delhi needs US's endorsement in dealing with China. Meanwhile, as China is an important neighbor, India will not completely sour China-India relations. India will not become a frontline country in countering China as the US hopes to see, because it will go against India's national interests.The author is director of the research department at the National Strategy Institute at Tsinghua University. opinion@globaltimes.com.cn",OPINION,ASIAN REVIEW,Indian External Affairs Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar Photo: AFP,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'Melbourne': ('LOC', 1), 'Australia': ('LOC', 4), 'India': ('LOC', 15), 'China': ('LOC', 12), 'Japan': ('LOC', 1), 'US': ('LOC', 2), 'Galwan Valley': ('LOC', 1), 'Beijing': ('LOC', 3), 'New Delhi': ('LOC', 4), 'Canberra': ('LOC', 1), 'Subrahmanyam Jaishankar': ('PER', 2), 'Jai': ('PER', 2), 'Ladak': ('PER', 1), 'Line of Actual Control': ('MISC', 1), 'LAC': ('MISC', 1), 'anti': ('MISC', 1)}"
70,"US to blame for rising Ukrainian crisis, not China-Russia energy ties",Global Times,2022-02-14,"A view recently emerged from the West argues that China's support for Russia, particularly the huge energy deals signed between Beijing and Moscow earlier this month, has emboldened the latter to take risks regarding the Ukraine crisis. Such an argument misinterprets the meaning of China-Russia cooperation. It is part of the same old attacks from some in the West on China, Russia, and their relations.For example, Gordon Chang, notorious for his ""China collapse"" theory, said in an interview on Sunday that China ""has just given Vladimir Putin the green light to invade [Ukraine]."" He argued the recently signed China-Russia energy deals are ""basically [China] backstopping the Russia to do whatever they want in EU."" Three days before that, Chang published an article in The Hill, claiming that ""China is making sanctions on Russia irrelevant.""China and Russia have a long history of close cooperation, including in the energy sector. From Beijing's point of view, the energy trade with Moscow is driven by the need for imported energy to sustain its fast economic growth. China's demand for cleaner energy sources like gas is also increasing to achieve its carbon emissions peak and carbon neutrality goals.The twisted understanding of China-Russia energy cooperation conforms to the prevailing interpretation of the current China-Russia relations in the West: The partnership between the two countries is simply a political ""marriage of convenience,"" and the cooperation between them intends to gain each other's support on political issues, be they domestic and international.China and Russia support each other on fighting against external interference and jointly resist threats to their national security. Yang Jin, an associate research fellow at the Institute of Russia, EU, and Central Asia Studies under the China Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times that it makes no sense to blame China-Russia cooperation for the intensified situation between Moscow and Kiev. Instead, it is the US that keeps agitating for a war, because it will be the only one benefiting from a head-on conflict, not Russia, Ukraine, or EU.According to Yang, some West forces are distorting the facts just to drive a wedge between China and Russia. ""China and Russia are engaging in active cooperation in many aspects, and high-level contacts between the two are also very close. This has made some in the West worry about the effectiveness of sanctions or suppression of China and Russia. Therefore, these forces take every opportunity to provoke conflicts between Beijing and Moscow,"" said Yang.However, it is difficult for them to achieve their goals. On the one hand, this is because China and Russia take similar or even the same positions on many issues. Such similarity makes it natural for the two countries to keep getting closer. This is the basis for strategic cooperation between Beijing and Moscow.Yang believes that there is a contradiction in how to deal with Russia in the West. To be more specific, the goals of the West contradict how it tries to achieve them. ""The West is exerting tremendous strategic pressure on Russia while expecting Russia to ease relations with it or to separate China from Russia,"" Yang noted.Against such a backdrop, no matter how malicious some West forces interpret China-Russia cooperation and Beijing's support for Moscow, they won't shake the rock-solid determination of the two countries to safeguard the interests of both as well as regional peace and development through cooperation.",OPINION,OBSERVER,China-Russia Photo: VCG,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'West': ('LOC', 5), 'China': ('LOC', 17), 'Russia': ('LOC', 15), 'Beijing': ('LOC', 3), 'Moscow': ('LOC', 4), 'Ukraine': ('LOC', 3), 'Kiev': ('LOC', 1), 'US': ('LOC', 1), 'Gordon Chang': ('PER', 2), 'Vladimir Putin': ('PER', 1), 'Yang Jin': ('PER', 3), 'EU': ('ORG', 3), 'The Hill': ('ORG', 1), 'Institute of Russia': ('ORG', 1), 'and Central Asia Studies': ('ORG', 1), 'China Academy of Social Sciences': ('ORG', 1), 'Global Times': ('ORG', 1)}"
71,"DPP, US link Ukraine crisis with Taiwan island, will only ‘draw China, Russia closer’",Wang Qi,2022-02-14,"As tensions rise in Ukraine and attract the world's attention, Taiwan, an island that has been largely ignored for a while, has begun to link its discourse to the Ukraine crisis, along with collaboration from some US officials who recently claimed that the Joe Biden administration believes that the US' response to the Ukraine crisis would be seen as a ""proxy"" for how it would respond to the Taiwan question. China experts pointed out Monday that the US and the Taiwan authority's hype is nothing but a game of political calculations as the island needs to assuage its anxieties about being a pawn that could be discarded by the US, while US, now less powerful, wants to make more economic and military gains by fabricating a war crisis.In a recent interview with India media news18.com on Friday, the head of Taiwan's external affairs authority, Joseph Wu Weishan, comparing the Ukraine crisis with the situation across the Taiwan Straits, said Taiwan is closely watching the situation, claiming that the China mainland is using the Winter Olympic Games to divert world attention for a possible war. A day later, three anonymous US senior officials told Bloomberg that China is ""gauging the US response"" to the Ukraine crisis as a ""proxy"" on the Taiwan question. But the US' response looks not solid as before. After US President Joe Biden spoke with Russia President Vladimir Putin on Saturday and warned that the US would ""respond decisively and impose swift and severe costs"" if Russia invades Ukraine, US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan on Sunday said that ""President Joe Biden is not intending to send in US forces to fight Russia"" if there is a war between Russia and Ukraine. Although Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky on Sunday invited Joe Biden to Ukraine to stabilize the situation, CNN, citing US officials, said the trip is extremely unlikely and there had been no positive response. ""A tale of two crises"" was gradually formed after Crimea in 2014, and many analysts, both in and outside of the China mainland, do not consider linking Taiwan and Ukraine proper, despite the US, the architect of the two crises, being the most to blame for the current situation. They said the US' hype of Ukraine and Taiwan island out of fear of a possible China -Russia ""alliance"" has brought China and Russia closer. The contradictory statements in the US show that the White House is also aware of the ""hyped nature"" of the two crises' linkage. Wu Weishan Zijia, a Taiwan-based political observer, said Joseph Wu Weishan remarks are absurd, as he is not the most authoritative person on talking about possible military conflict across the Taiwan Straits, because he does not have access to as much information as military officials. Perhaps he found that the US were deliberately adding fuel to the Ukraine-Taiwan link, so he has been helping the US to grow the momentum, the observer said.   Xin Qiang, deputy director of the Center for US Studies at Fudan University, told the Global Times that in the case of the mainland's increasing military deterrence against secessionists, the Taiwan authority is afraid that the US will become too preoccupied with Ukraine, and will care less about Taiwan, especially when US's credibility and promise have already been torn apart.Xin said that the military-industrial complex is always behind US provocations and hyping of other ""threats."" The arms sales business to Taiwan will become more prosperous, said Xin, noting that the Taiwan authority can use the ""warming ties"" with the US to attract more local support. Yuan Zheng, deputy director of the Institute of US Studies at the China Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times that Ukraine and Taiwan island are neither core US interests. However, US manipulation of these two challenged the bottom line of Russia and China, which led to their closer ties.Following the highly anticipated meeting between China President Xi Jinping and Russia President Vladimir Putin on February 4, China and Russia issued a joint statement that elaborated on shared views and consensus on major global and regional issues and delivered a scathing rejection of the US-led West's hegemony that increasingly threatens global security and stability.The two countries also coordinated their stand on the one-China principle and opposition to the expansion of NATO.The Joe Biden administration has almost given up trying to improve relations with Russia, and confrontation with China has become its dominant ideology, Yuan said. Although the Joe Biden administration has realized the limitations of doing so, hawkish pressure has made them unable to turn back, so they can only use the ""threats"" of China and Russia to strengthen their alliance and then use the alliance to deal with both countries, Yuan said.",CHINA,DIPLOMACY,"Taipei, the island of Taiwan.

72,Biz Quick Take: Is G7's threat of sanctions against Russia 'economic coercion'?,Global Times,2022-02-14,"Following an intense warmongering over border tensions between Russia and Ukraine, which has drawn widespread criticism, even within the US, US appears poised to further fan the flames, as it has mobilized its G7 allies to issue a blatant threat against Russia. In a joint statement on Monday, the G7 finance ministers said that ""we are prepared to collectively impose economic and financial sanctions which will have massive and immediate consequences on the Russia economy.""Given the current tensions between the West and Russia, in addition to the West sanctions against Russia, the statement might have come as no surprise to many. However, at a time when the US, the EU and other West countries are constantly accusing China of ""economic coercion"" against Australia and Lithuania, the statement lays bare the incredible hypocrisy of the West.Just three days ago, on Friday, the US rallied its Asia Pacific allies of the Quad, Australia, Japan and India, to issue a joint statement saying that they ""oppose coercive economic policies"" and ""will work collectively to foster global economic resilience against such actions."" The statement did not mention China but many West media outlets pointed out that it was a reference of Australia's claim of ""economic coercion"" by China. To fully grasp the utter contradiction in the position of the US regarding economic coercion just think about this: the US declared its unmistakable opposition to economic coercion and then, just three days later, threatened to do exactly that. Now, many in the US might want to play semantics about what constitutes economic coercion. But here is a definition, according to the Oxford Handbooks, ""economic coercion is a threatened or actual imposition of economic costs on one state by another with the objective of extracting a policy concession.""Is that not exactly what the G7 has done and threatened to do to Russia? And we are not just talking about the blatant threats made on Monday but years of sanctions against Russia. The Ukraine-Russia border issue is extremely complicated with many players involved and so much misinformation spread by the US and some of its West allies. However, for anyone who can read English, it should be crystal clear that what the US and its allies are doing is coercion, regardless of how hard they try to spin it. Another crucial point is that while the US and its West allies have actually imposed or threatened to impose economic sanctions on Russia, if Moscow does not concede to their demands, China has never threatened or imposed any sanctions against Australia, Lithuania or anyone for that matter. In fact, the only economic measures China has taken in recent years against another country are the counter tariffs against the US' punitive duties on China products imposed during the trade war. The WTO has allowed China to take countermeasures against some of the US tariffs. Moreover, China has not sanctioned any US businesses, even though the US has sanctioned hundreds of China companies.In this regard, the EU has also displayed an incredible level of hypocrisy. The bloc recently filed a complaint at the WTO alleging that China's ""economic coercion"" against Lithuania hurts EU businesses. Needless to say, the EU did not produce any evidence because there is not any economic coercion. Australia was the first to cry ""economic coercion"" by China, but after years of making such claims, Canberra has never produced any evidence that China has imposed any economic sanctions against Australia.How is it that made-up ""China economic coercion"" garners so much attention, while actual economic coercion by the US and its West allies appears so normal, at least in global media coverage? That is double-standard and West hegemony at play as China and many developing nations have repeatedly pointed out. For the moment, regardless of how developing nations like China protest against such shameless hegemony, the West still holds the megaphone. However, as they recklessly behave in complete disregard for any principle and international norm, West credibility and influence in the international stage will further decline, a trend that has already been established over the years.In a joint statement earlier this month, China and Russia announced a clear opposition to hegemony and external interference, which they describe as threats to global and regional peace and vowed to usher in a new era of international relations based on mutual respect and equality. While West elites sought to discredit the joint statement, many around the world are likely watching closely and looking forward to an era of international relations that are rid of constant bullying from the US and some West powers. In a sense, the more the US behaves so recklessly and shamelessly, the sooner a fair and just global force will be formed.",SOURCE,ECONOMY,G7 File Photo: VCG,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'Russia': ('LOC', 9), 'Ukraine': ('LOC', 2), 'US': ('LOC', 10), 'West': ('LOC', 7), 'China': ('LOC', 3), 'Australia': ('LOC', 3), 'Lithuania': ('LOC', 1), 'Asia Pacific': ('LOC', 1), 'Japan': ('LOC', 1), 'India': ('LOC', 1), 'Moscow': ('LOC', 1), 'G7': ('ORG', 2), 'EU': ('ORG', 1), 'G': ('ORG', 1), 'Oxford Handbooks': ('MISC', 1), 'English': ('MISC', 1)}"
73,US steps up moves to woo Pacific island countries after releasing Indo-Pacific strategy,GT staff reporters,2022-02-13," In order to match up with release of its long-awaited Indo-Pacific strategy on Friday, the Joe Biden administration has hastened steps to enhancing its footprint in the region, by announcing to reopen an embassy in the South Pacific nation of the Solomon Islands, and arranging a lightning visit to Fiji by its Secretary of State. Experts said the US' ""sudden and cordial"" move to woo Pacific islands nations demonstrates its anxiety over China's deepened relationship with those countries.While being bogged down in the Ukraine situation, the US is still attempting to marshal Indo-Pacific countries and signaling that this region still tops Joe Biden administration's diplomatic list of priorities, by sending US Secretary of State Antony Blinken to tour the region, and releasing the Indo-Pacific strategy calling for preventing China from ""transforming the region into its own sphere of influence.""Yet experts pointed out many flaws of the US plan, which includes US's overestimation of its ability to handle the ""two-front confrontations"" with both China and Russia; the regional nations' reluctance to be dragged into a ""US-or-them"" situation between the US and China. They believe the US Indo-Pacific goal is too big that it is basically a ""fantasy"" for US to achieve. The US plans to reopen its embassy in the Solomon Islands, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced Saturday in nearby Fiji during a virtual meeting with 18 Pacific Island leaders.During the virtual meeting, Antony Blinken underscored US's focus on the region. The top US diplomat said the embassy on the Solomon Islands is being reestablished to help the US counter China influence in the politically unstable country.In response, a spokesperson from the China embassy in Solomon Islands said on Sunday that the cooperation between China and the Pacific island country has brought substantial benefit to people from both countries. The bilateral relation is established under the basis of equal, mutual respect and benefit; and is not targeted at any third party. China upholds the notion of a community with a shared future for mankind, and the Pacific island nation promotes the idea of ""making more friends, making no enemies,"" said the spokesperson, urging other countries to meet such notions half way, discard zero sum mentality and contribute more to development and stability of Pacific countries. In Fiji, where the top US diplomat visited on Saturday, Antony Blinken said the US was ready to spend more money to support the Pacific Islands. It marks the first time in 37 years a US Secretary of State had visited Fiji. The South Pacific became the first region the US tried to pander to after Joe Biden administration issued the long-awaited Indo-Pacific Strategy shows the region has become the next important strategic arena for the US to compete with China, Chen Hong, a professor and director of the Australia Studies Centre, China Normal University, told the Global Times. He explained that the US is deeply anxious about China's growing ties with the regional countries through the Belt and Road Initiative, investment projects, and building roads and ports.But these island countries are crystal clear about the US' true agenda, said Chen, noting that they are reluctant to be served as instrument of big power struggles; and are fully aware China can bring them substantial benefit. ""So those Pacific island countries will disappoint US.""Too big a goalExperts agreed Antony Blinken's ongoing Asia trip since last week, and the newly released strategy show that the US still prioritizes sustained engagement with the region, even as it faces the more acute Ukraine issue.It also comes after China and Russia declared earlier this month a ""no limits"" strategic partnership, their detailed and assertive statement to work together, and joint objection of any extraterritorial attempts to sabotage the common surrounding areas of the two countries. The 12-page strategy overview, released by the White House on Friday, vowed to focus on ""every corner of the region from South Asia to the Pacific Islands"" to strengthen commitment to pursue a ""free and open Indo-Pacific"" through building stronger alliance, strengthening emerging partnerships and investing more in the region. Rather than repeatedly mentioning ""China"" and ""democracy,"" this new overview in a crafty way overstates ""partnership"" and ""alliance"" in an attempt to tout for support and understanding from the US public, its allies and media, experts said. ""Although the overview seems more like a practical and detailed action plan than that of the previous Donald Trump administration, it is calling for closer US integration with other players, requiring Asia countries to cut off ties and for decoupling the current cross-national frameworks with China. But is it possible?"" Xin Qiang, deputy director of the Center for US Studies at Fudan University, told the Global Times。Lü Xiang, a research fellow at the China Academy of Social Sciences saw the strategy as a ""ridiculous conclusion of the US on dealing with so-called 'Indo-Pacific' affairs"" in an attempt to join hands with a wide range of Asia countries who are reluctant to do so, except Australia.Antony Blinken met foreign ministers from Quad, a security group among the US, Japan, India and Australia on Friday. India Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar said on Friday that the Quad had a positive agenda. He said the Quad stood ""for something, not against somebody"".Joe Biden administration's Indo-Pacific Strategy also singled India out, by stressing the importance of ""a strong India"" as a partner in a positive regional vision.Lü stated that India has always been seen by US as ""weak link"" in the Quad, and the US Indo-Pacific Strategy as the former clings to its diplomatic autonomy and distances itself from, or even has discrepancies with the US on certain issues, such as climate change.He said that stressing India doesn't mean the US will endorse great benefit for India, or attach special attention to the country; but just signals the importance of India in its regional strategy. On the flashpoint of Taiwan question, which is purely China's domestic affairs, the strategy claimed ""US would work with partners inside and outside the region to maintain peace and stability in the strait dividing the island from China."" Hyping the Taiwan question as a regional question mirrored the US realization of its inability to interfere with this question politically and militarily, and the wording won't push itself into a perilous situation, said the expert.Experts believed that the strategy, which desperately urged reluctant countries to act together to counter China, is not only a waste of its already shrinking diplomatic resources, but also reflected the US' ""powerlessness"" in competing with China on its own. ""In the end, US will realize its Indo-Pacific strategy is too big to be realized by such a declining power, basically a fantasy,"" said Lü.",CHINA,DIPLOMACY,"Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison (center) addresses US Secretary of State Antony Blinken (left), Australian Foreign Minister Marise Payne (2nd from left), Indian External Affairs Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar (2nd from right) and Japan's Foreign Minister Yoshimasa Hayashi (right) before a Quad meeting in Melbourne on February 11, 2022.

74,"US needs Ukraine crisis to harm European economy, and legitimize its military presence",Yang Sheng,2022-02-13,"

Combat crews of the S-400 air defense system taking up combat duty during joint exercises by Russia and Belarus on February 9, 2022 which center around ""suppressing and repelling external aggression"" amid West claims that Moscow is plotting a major escalation of the conflict in Ukraine. Photo: AFPAs the Ukraine crisis becomes ever more complex, with the US claiming that Russia is planning for an imminent invasion while Moscow continuing to deny it and accusing US of spreading fear via disinformation, China analysts said US needs the crisis to remain heightened even if Russia has no intention of using force.China analysts said Sunday that keeping the crisis intense will benefit the US in several fields: legitimizing its military presence in EU by demonizing Russia and poisoning Russia-EU ties, increasing uncertainties and concerns to harm the eurozone economy so there will be more capital flight from the continent to the US and thus easing the US inflation pressure, and using the tension to stir up trouble for China-Russia ties. Therefore, the US is using all means to maintain the heightened tension, including spreading disinformation and strengthening military deployments to provoke Russia - in other words, the US is sacrificing Ukraine's security to serve its own strategy to compete with Russia, experts said.Russia President Vladimir Putin had telephone conversations with France President Emmanuel Macron and US President Joe Biden on Saturday, TASS reported on Sunday. Conversations were held at the request of Paris and US. Vladimir Putin reminded his counterparts that ""the West does not do enough to force Ukraine to perform the Minsk Agreements"" and said ""the Russia response to the US and NATO answers on security guarantees will be presented shortly.""Paris said after the conversation that they do not believe that Moscow ""is preparing an offensive"" against Ukraine, while US stated that it is still unclear whether Russia plans to achieve its goal diplomatically or ""by way of using force.""Analysts said no party can bear the consequence of the situation out of control totally, and if conflict breaks out, the US would not be the losing party, and could even benefit if the conflict remains limited. In this scenario, it would harm Ukraine and its neighbors, so US is the one that potentially welcomes a conflict, not Moscow, Kiev, Paris or other parties.Be calm, stay alert The China embassy in Ukraine released a notice on its WeChat public account Friday to urge China nationals in Ukraine to ""pay close attention to"" changes in the local situation, as the US and several other West countries asked their nationals ""to evacuate immediately"" amid so-called warnings of an imminent invasion by Russia. The notice said ""the epidemic situation is worsening in Ukraine, and it caused multiple cases of China nationals getting infected in Ukraine or found to be infected after returning to China. At the same time, the Ukraine-Russia tensions have drawn attention from many parties, and different types of contradictory information have emerged.""The embassy urged China nationals in the country to strengthen epidemic prevention and pay close attention to ""the changing situation"" of Ukraine crisis. Some other countries are not as calm as China. Following the US and the UK, many West countries, including Australia, Italy, Israel, the Netherlands and Japan have told their citizens to leave Ukraine. Some have evacuated diplomatic staff and their families.Jin Canrong, associate dean of the School of International Studies at the Renmin University of China, said the China embassy notice is probably based on concern over the US to further meddle in the situation by creating chaos, rather than echoing the West estimation over Russia's military operation against Ukraine. ""It's totally unnecessary for Russia to invade Ukraine at this stage unless Ukraine launches attacks against Crimea or the Eastern Ukraine regions first. But US continues to pay great efforts to hype the information about 'Russia's invasion' in the past few months, even though the information sounds very unrealistic and it's harmful for the situation. So the US is doing this for its own reasons,"" Jin said.The most reasonable analysis is that a worsening situation could force EU capital flight for safe havens in the US, and this could ease US pressure on inflation, as the US has done such things before, said Li Haidong, a professor from the Institute of International Relations of China Foreign Affairs University.But the EU capital is mature, and there are no signs of large capital transfers to US market, so perhaps this is why the US is making efforts to ramp up the tensions, Jin said.  Li said that keeping a military deterrence but not attacking Ukraine is the best choice for Russia at the moment because Moscow needs to make NATO feel the risks and does not want Ukraine to join NATO. A hot war will ruin everything and neither Moscow nor Kiev can afford such an unpredictable scenario. ""It's possible that if Moscow and Kiev both keep calm, the US would use its proxies, such as NGOs or agents in Ukraine to create new troubles or to spark conflicts between Russia and Ukraine. This is what we need to pay attention to, rather than worrying about a so-called 'Russia invasion' hyped by the US,"" Jin noted.What China can do?On Sunday, Australia followed the US to urge China to help them push Russia, with Australia Prime Minister Scott Morrison calling on China to not remain ""chillingly silent"" on the crisis. On Thursday, US Ambassador to the UN Linda Thomas-Greenfield said ""We would hope that the China would play a role in encouraging the Russia to do the right thing.""China analysts said the attempt is clear, as US wants to create a trap for China - if China does what they say based on their information about Russia's invasion, then China-Russia ties would be harmed, but if China does not act they can accuse China of remaining ""chillingly silent."" China Ambassador to the UN Zhang Jun responded on his Twitter account on Thursday immediately that ""Our message is consistent and clear: Resolve any differences through diplomacy. Stop hyping up the tension. Russia's legitimate security concerns should be seriously addressed.""Yang Jin, an associate research fellow at the Institute of Russia, EU and Central Asia Studies at the China Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times on Sunday that ""Australia's accusation is totally nonsense. Zhang's remarks prove that China didn't remain silent.""China is not a main actor on the crisis, and if there is anything China could do to mediate, the relevant parties need to bring the negotiation to the UN, however it seems like the US and NATO do not want to solve the problem through the UN platform but prefer talking to Russia directly, Yang said. ""So how could they expect China to get involved in such an issue deeply?"" Yang noted.Jin said China does not need to take US or Australia officials' remarks seriously, as they just want to stir up trouble for China-Russia relations. China needs to keep close watch, oppose any act to hype up tensions by spreading fear via disinformation, and urge relevant parties to solve the problems via diplomacy.",CHINA,DIPLOMACY,"A Ukrainian serviceman patrols along a position at the front line with the eastern rebels not far from Avdiivka, Donetsk region, Ukraine.

75,"Instigating Ukraine crisis serves US interests, offers lesson for Taiwan island",Global Times,2022-02-13,"Taiwan island has recently expressed its concerns over the Ukraine crisis several times, exploiting it as another chance to beat the drum of the so-called threat from the China mainland. The Taiwan authorities act just like a drama queen. This kind of hype is totally groundless.""All military units continue to pay close attention to the situation in Ukraine and movements in the Taiwan Straits, continue to strengthen joint intelligence and surveillance, and gradually increase the level of combat readiness in response to various signs and threats to effectively respond to various situations,"" Taiwan authorities said on Saturday.Furthermore, when interviewed by India news channel CNN-News18 on Friday, Joseph Wu Weishan, leader of the external affairs authority of Taiwan, said they were watching very carefully whether the mainland was going to take advantage of a West distracted by Ukraine to attack the island.The island lies far away from Ukraine and there are no frequent exchanges between the two. The two sides have not set up representative offices with each other. What Ukraine crisis really involves is global powers such as EU, the US and Russia, as it involves the regional security and stability of EU and the strategic relationship between the US and Russia, two nuclear powers. Taiwan island's concerns over Ukraine tensions come as a bit odd. It will be nothing more than another attempt to echo US's hype of the threat from the China mainland.  ""The Ukraine tensions to a large extent have been hyped up by the US. So has the so-called possibility of the China mainland attacking the island. Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) authority has also fueled the fire over the latter. It comes from the needs of both the US and Taiwan's DPP in seeking own political purposes,"" Xin Qiang, deputy director of the Center for US Studies at Fudan University, told the Global Times. ""DPP authority hopes its slandering over the China mainland can help serve its elections, while the US intends to ramp up its arms sales and integrate Taiwan island into its geopolitical strategy by doing so. Furthermore, as US has already labeled China and Russia as its top rivals, it believes calumniating on the two countries can pile more pressure on them among the international community.""In January, Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky accused US and the media of fueling panic amid the US repeatedly touting that Russia will soon invade Ukraine. And such panic weighed on the economy while there were ""no tanks in the streets,"" according to Reuters. Taiwan authorities should learn from the current crisis in Ukraine. It will be Taiwan itself which bears the loss when the US intensively and groundlessly advertises the China mainland's ""invasion"" over Taiwan.The root cause of the Ukraine issue is that the US has promoted NATO's eastward expansion unrestrainedly, pushing Russia into a corner. US intends to instigate wars. The tensions in Ukraine, or even a war, are in the best interests of US. Ukraine will suffer the biggest loss if a war breaks out, followed by Russia, and then the EU. The US, which is located far away from the Ukraine frontline, will become a safe haven for global capital. As a result, Ukraine will be messed up. EU will have no choice but to be further tied to the chariots of the US. And EU's strategic autonomy will become empty talk. Taiwan should learn a lesson from the current Ukraine crisis. ""If Taiwan island, under the constant instigation from the US, provokes war with the China mainland, the biggest victim will only be the island. Taiwan has always been used as a pawn for the US to pursue its own interests,"" Xin noted.To tie themselves to the US' chariot is to hand over their fate to the US.

76,US ropes in Quad allies to fight ‘two-front wars’ with China and Russia despite spent force,Wang Wenwen,2022-02-11,"The sign is clearer than ever that the US is turning Quad into a tool to serve its own strategic goal of countering China and Russia simultaneously, observers said, as US Secretary of State Antony Blinken brought the topic of the Ukraine crisis to the Friday meeting of Quad foreign ministers even though this group of US, Australia, Japan and India was formed for ""Indo-Pacific"" affairs and to target China.Antony Blinken said the US must stand up with its allies for a rules-based system threatened by ""China aggression"" and the world's response to the Ukraine crisis was being watched by ""others,"" which Bloomberg said was a pointed reference to China's ""expansion"" in Asia. Antony Blinken also warned that Russia is amassing more troops and an invasion of Ukraine could come ""any time"" though Kremlin had denied such intention and urged the NATO to restrain itself. China experts believe US is trying to declare it is determined to fight and can win on two fronts - China and Russia - at the same time to emphasize the US' hegemonic status and try its best to mobilize as many allies and partners as possible to serve this strategic goal amid anxiety over unprecedented China-Russia relations. But they pointed out the Joe Biden administration has seriously misjudged itself and the international situation because the US today, deeply split and plagued by domestic problems, has neither the capability to contain two major powers simultaneously, nor the leadership to maintain trust from allies.  Drowning manOn Thursday, US President Joe Biden urged US in Ukraine to leave immediately and warned ""things could go crazy quickly"" in an interview with NBC. The remarks were interpreted by China observers as another hype of a ""Russia invasion"" threat to persuade its allies to join actions against Russia. The US plan worked to a very limited extent when Japan Foreign Minister Yoshimasa Hayashi said it ""shared grave concerns"" over Russia military buildup during his meeting with Antony Blinken. Australia Foreign Minister Marise Payne also said ""Russia military build-up on Ukraine's border has deeply concerned Australia and our allies and partners"" despite the fact that Australia, very isolated in the South Pacific, has little contact with Russia and no interest on the issue.Chen Hong, a professor and director of the Australia Studies Centre at China Normal University, told the Global Times on Friday that the US is eager to combine all its tools and mobilize US-led platforms to tackle the Ukraine crisis and China's rise all at once.Lü Xiang, a research fellow at the China Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times on Friday the US was more like a drowning man clutching at a straw. But the more the US wants to leave its own people and the world an impression that it can manage confrontations against China and Russia and maintain a US-led world order, the more embarrassing a situation it is in because its failures in domestic governance, in the democratic system, in overseas operations such as the Afghan withdrawal, are obvious to all.Chen also said mixing up the Ukraine crisis and Indo-Pacific strategy exposed US anxiety on the China-Russia relations ""without a limit,"" which was further consolidated through a joint statement signed after the face-to-face meeting of the two top leaders on February 4 ahead of the opening ceremony of Winter Olympic Games. Yury Tavrovsky, head of ""Russia Dream-China Dream"" analytic center of the Izborsk Club, told the Global Times on Friday that the US under Donald Trump overestimated its potential of waging two ""cold wars"" simultaneously and added ""China front"" to the already functioning ""Russia front."" Now Joe Biden wants to rope in all liberal capitalist countries to shore up US's declining power, and the Quad, AUKUS and so-called summit for democracy are the manifestations. This way further divides the world and accelerates China-Russia partnership, the expert said.Sergey Biryukov, a professor at the Siberian Institute of Management in Novosibirsk of Russia, told the Global Times that as a result of their developing partnership, China and Russia have gained opportunities to contain the militarization of the region through the structures of Quad and AUKUS. Wills and realities The US wanted to tout the ""China threat"" in the Indo-Pacific and ""Russia threat"" in EU, but lacked a clear mind on how much its allies would buy into it, experts said. The Quad itself is not a capable mechanism and can hardly yield any concrete results, not to mention Quad members are cautious of making Russia their target, Lü said. Japan, despite territorial disputes with Russia, won't take it as a priority and India won't see Russia as a target either. The US can get nothing more than verbal support on the Ukraine issue at the Quad table, experts said.Though India may have the motivation to create trouble for China via Quad, it has more to care about internal affairs, including the epidemic, supply chains and commercial technologies, experts said. The US may woo Japan to stir up trouble for China as the two East Asia neighbors are having some difficulties in bilateral relations. But Japan won't completely serve as a US tool and it has maintained dialogue channels with China to handle problems and manage conflicts. Australia appears to be the only loyal US follower in the bloc, betting all on worsening China-US relations like a desperate gambler and even mulling to expand their target to Russia, but the US won't appreciate Australia's sacrifice or compensate the losses when the US has a policy adjustment, experts said.Lithuania, a non-Quad country, sent its foreign minister Gabrielius Landsbergis to Australia to seek more support for its stance amid spats with China. The country also has intense relations with Russia. Experts said the Baltic nation is tied so close to the US boat by some politicians that it has little flexibility to do what's beneficial for its people.    Lü said the US sets fire everywhere to demonstrate its competence and attraction in front of allies, and uses whatever tools at hands to win the ""two-front battle,"" but it has forgotten it no longer has the leadership to ask others to extinguish the fire. Allies have to think twice before making real commitments beyond rhetorical support for the US considering uncertainty in US domestic politics, namely the midterm elections and the 2024 presidential election, experts said.The latest F35 crash and nuclear submarine collision in the China Sea reminded the public of how much the US can achieve amid its ambitious Indo-Pacific strategy, Lü said.",CHINA,DIPLOMACY,"Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison (center) addresses US Secretary of State Antony Blinken (left), Australian Foreign Minister Marise Payne (2nd from left), Indian External Affairs Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar (2nd from right) and Japan's Foreign Minister Yoshimasa Hayashi (right) before a Quad meeting in Melbourne on February 11, 2022.

78,"China, Russia accelerate energy cooperation amid deepened interdependency of two economies",GT Staff reporters,2022-02-10," New energy cooperation projects are being carried out in full swing between China and Russia as the interdependency of the two economies has been strengthened following the meeting of the countries' top leaders during the 2022 Winter Olympic Games.Energy is the biggest area of bilateral cooperation and multidimensional energy cooperation is making new gains as the two countries continue to boost their friendly partnerships, experts said.An underwater shield-crossing project that passes through the Yangtze River of the China-Russia Eastern Gas Pipeline is in full swing, which is the key project of the southern section of the China-Russia Eastern Gas Pipeline. It has a total length of 10.226 kilometers, and it's the longest tunnel under construction across the Yangtze River.The pipeline is a major strategic project contributing to China-Russia energy cooperation, which was agreed on and highlighted by the heads of both countries, who noted its significance for deepening all-round cooperation between the two countries and promoting the integration of their interests.The project, with the northern, middle and southern sections built in phases, has a total length of 5,111 km, starting at the China-Russia border in Heihe City, Northeast China's Heilongjiang Province, passing through nine provinces and cities, including Northeast China's Jilin Province and China's Jiangsu Province, and ending in Shanghai.On February 3, China National Petroleum Corp (CNPC) and Russia's Gazprom signed an agreement on the purchase and sale of gas from the Russia Far East, another important result of cooperation in gas trade.Under the agreement, Russia will increase its pipeline gas supply to China by 10 billion cubic meters a year, which, together with the ""Siberian Power"" pipeline, will bring total gas supply to China to 48 cubic meters per year.In terms of oil cooperation, CNPC and Russia's Rosneft Oil signed a supplementary agreement on the purchase and sale of crude oil. According to the agreement, Russia will continue to supply 100 million tons of crude oil to China via Kazakhstan for a period of 10 years. As of January, CNPC had imported more than 300 million tons of crude oil and more than 15 cubic meters of natural gas from Russia by pipeline.""Oil and gas cooperation is the biggest area of cooperation between China and Russia, due to the huge complementarity of the two nations in the energy sector,"" Lin Boqiang, director of the China Center for Energy Economics Research at Xiamen University, told the Global Times on Thursday.The export of energy products has always been an important part of Russia's fiscal revenue and tensions with Ukraine have reduced the scope for Russia energy exports to EU. In this context, China provides a big market for Russia gas and oil, Lin said.The friendly bilateral relations also add to energy security for China, which will greatly benefit its economic growth, Lin said.Due to certain advantages, this partnership involving the exchange of markets and resources is also expected to expand, as China's demand for Russia oil and gas continues and the two sides may explore further cooperation in renewable energy and other fields, Lin said.Russia is also China's main source of imported coal. And, China and Russia have escalated cooperation in the field of nuclear energy, including the Tianwan Nuclear Power Plant in Lianyungang, China's Jiangsu Province and the Xudabao Nuclear Power Plant in Huludao, Northeast China's Liaoning Province. China-Russia bilateral trade in 2021 grew 35.9 percent year-on-year, reaching $146.8 billion, exceeding the threshold of $140 billion for the first time, an all-time high, official data showed. The two nations have set a goal of reaching $200 billion in bilateral trade by 2024.China will work with Russia to promote cooperation in trade, energy, agriculture, science and technology, aerospace, digital connectivity and finance, moving toward the $200 billion trade target at an earlier date, a spokesperson from China's Ministry of Commerce said in Beijing on Thursday.",SOURCE,ECONOMY,"The construction site of China-Russia east-route natural gas pipeline in Heihe, Northeast China's Heilongjiang Province File photo: VCG",Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'China': ('LOC', 9), 'Russia2 Winter Olympic Games': ('LOC', 1), 'Yangtze River': ('LOC', 2), 'Russia': ('LOC', 10), 'Heihe City': ('LOC', 1), 'Northeast China': ('LOC', 11), 'Heilongjiang Province': ('LOC', 1), 'Jilin Province': ('LOC', 1), 'Jiangsu Province': ('LOC', 1), 'Shanghai': ('LOC', 1), 'Russia Far East': ('LOC', 11), 'Kazakhstan': ('LOC', 1), 'China -': ('MISC', 2), 'Eastern Gas Pipeline': ('MISC', 2), 'Siberian Power': ('MISC', 1), 'China National Petroleum Corp': ('ORG', 1), 'CNPC': ('ORG', 2), 'Gazprom': ('ORG', 1), 'Lin Bo': ('ORG', 1), 'Center': ('ORG', 1)}"
79,Does the US want to play with Asia-Pacific allies again?: Global Times editorial,Global Times,2022-02-07,"
According to US media reports, US President Joe Biden is preparing to unveil his administration's first broad economic strategy for the Asia-Pacific region. It is called the ""Indo-Pacific Economic Framework."" The Joe Biden administration has pinned high hopes on this framework, and expects to use it to fill in the gap in its absence in a comprehensive trade agreement in the region, making up for the shortcomings of the Indo-Pacific Strategy in the economic and trade field. However, the most important thing for US is to form a small economic and trade circle that excludes China, and fight against ""China's expanding influence in the region.""  It must be said that the US is daydreaming. According to reports, the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework focuses on building digital trade rules, reshaping regional supply chains, and establishing green technology standards to siege China in key sectors in the economic and trade field, and further reinforce Asia-Pacific countries' dependence on the US. This will ensure the US' dominant position in the global supply chain. Instead of saying that the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework is a new platform to serve the economic development of the Asia-Pacific region, one might as well say that it is a new weapon to serve US geopolitical goals.To manipulate this ""new weapon,"" US has done a lot. Last year, senior US officials took turns to visit Asia-Pacific countries. They came to peddle the framework before it was officially formed. At a time when the Ukraine issue is on the verge of breaking out into a fight, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken will visit Australia from Monday, attend the fourth Quad Foreign Ministers Ministerial Meeting among the US, Australia, India and Japan, and then go to Fiji to meet with Pacific Island leaders. US acknowledged that the trip relates to ""the challenges that China poses."" People can thus anticipate that his trip will be an advertising campaign for the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework. Driven by the zero-sum Cold War mentality, US regards the friendly cooperation and normal exchanges between China and other countries as a fire emergency. It is attempting to put out the fire in a hurry-scurry and uneasy manner. The Joe Biden administration has come up with a big move, trying to cut the economic and trade exchanges between China and Asia-Pacific countries abruptly, and to build a wall from a crevice, to solve the problem once and for all. But the reality in the Asia-Pacific is chilly for the US. Today, when economic globalization is developing, it is unimaginable to build a wall to exclude the world's largest trading power. This goes against the true wishes of Asia-Pacific countries and does not conform to their vital interests. No matter how extravagantly US talks, the undertone of the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework is closed, exclusive, and US First-driven. It runs counter to multilateralism and free trade, and at best is like a Thanksgiving dinner without turkeys. The other players are nothing more than vassals in the US-dominated supply chain. Everyone is clear about this.On the comprehensive economic and trade agreement, the US has already played around with its allies once. The Obama administration vigorously pushed for negotiations on the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), but it was shelved by the US after other members had gone through legal procedures. Donald Trump walked out of it as soon as he took office, leaving US allies stunned. Japan wants to invite the US to rejoin, but the Joe Biden administration started its own and came up with the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework. While the US is capricious on major issues, how can it be trusted by others? Unless the lackeys like to be played with.US's understanding of ""competition"" has long deviated from the original intention of ""progress."" The US seems to have done a lot of things in the name of ""competition"" in recent years, but the result is basically having messed things up while consuming resources. That's because it does not understand the path to development. Past experience has proven that no economy can achieve sustained growth amid isolation and exclusion. On New Year's Day this year, the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) came into effect and all US allies in the region participated, which shows that win-win cooperation is the choice of the times.Against this backdrop, US still wants to use brute force to pull the wheel of the time backward, but it doesn't know that it will only make itself stumble in the end. We can conclude that even if the US finally puts up the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework, it will eventually turn out to be another mirage the US creates for its allies.",OPINION,EDITORIAL,Illustration: Chen Xia/GT,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'US': ('LOC', 13), 'Asia': ('LOC', 5), 'Pacific': ('LOC', 6), 'China': ('LOC', 6), 'Ukraine': ('LOC', 1), 'Australia': ('LOC', 2), 'India': ('LOC', 1), 'Japan': ('LOC', 1), 'Fiji': ('LOC', 1), 'Joe Biden': ('PER', 3), 'Antony Blinken': ('PER', 1), 'Indo - Pacific Economic Framework': ('MISC', 5), 'Indo - Pacific Strategy': ('MISC', 2), 'Meeting': ('MISC', 1), 'Pacific Island': ('MISC', 1)}"
80,Live and in person,AFP,2022-02-08," The 72nd Berlin film festival opens Thursday, bucking a trend of pandemic on-the-couch streaming with a packed program of live premieres featuring a stable of EU screen legends.Just as the coronavirus outbreak roars toward its peak in Germany, Berlinale organizers have opted for an 11-day, in-person celebration of new movies and a gala ceremony to award its Golden Bear top prize.The festival said it was crucial to give cinemas a boost when COVID-19 fears had fuelled home viewing on small screens, and the Germany government called the ""courageous"" step of holding the event ""a sign of hope.""""It says: we won't let corona beat US. We need cinema and culture,"" government spokesman Wolfgang Buechner said.Artistic director Carlo Chatrian said the Berlinale aimed to give weary audiences a break and some inspiration.""Never before we have seen and welcomed so many love stories as this year - crazy, improbable, unexpected and intoxicating love, which is after all what all encounters are about deep down.""Nick Cave, conflict zones In competition are 18 films from around the world from hot young auteurs and cinema veterans - including seven directed by women. More than 200 other pictures are showing in sidebar sections.A jury led by India-born US director M. Night Shyamalan (""The Sixth Sense"") will pick the winners.The line-up includes new movies from France directors Francois Ozon and Claire Denis, ""Carol"" screenwriter Phyllis Nagy and Italy's Paolo Taviani, a previous winner and at 90 the oldest award contender.Italy horror master Dario Argento will show his first new picture in a decade - ""Dark Glasses"", starring his daughter Asia Argento.Autograph seekers will be banned from the red carpet but stars including Emma Thompson, Sigourney Weaver, Charlotte Gainsbourg, Juliette Binoche, Isabelle Huppert and Mark Rylance have been invited to present their latest films.Huppert will also pick up a Golden Bear for lifetime achievement.South Korea festival favorite Hong Sang-soo will unveil ""The Novelist's Film"" and Li Ruijun, part of a new generation of China arthouse directors, will show his village romance ""Return to Dust.""In keeping with its tradition as the most politically minded of the big festivals, the Berlinale will turn the spotlight on conflict zones including South Sudan, the Central Africa Republic, Myanmar and eastern Ukraine, with a slew of new documentaries.Plus ""This Much I Know To Be True"" will show how Australia rocker Nick Cave stayed creative under lockdown. 'Extra sausage' The Berlinale ranks among EU's top festivals alongside Cannes and Venice, which also went live last year but during ebbs in the pandemic.The recent Sundance and Rotterdam festivals were forced by COVID-19 to go entirely virtual and many expected Berlin to follow suit.But after an all-online festival last March, followed by outdoor screenings in the summer, the Berlinale worked with authorities to develop crowd safety measures.The decision has caused controversy, with local media asking how organizers could justify it while the virus has closed hundreds of creches and hospitals strain under the outbreak.The B.Z. tabloid said the festival seemed to be getting ""extra sausage"" - Germany for special treatment - while public broadcaster RBB called it ""delusional"" and newspaper Tagesspiegel warned: ""The virus will be pleased"". Industry insiders noted that the festival's requirements on vaccination, daily testing and reduced capacity marked a valiant effort but wondered if it was all worth it.""Berlin is quite well organized. The safety measures are top notch so if anyone could pull it off successfully and safely, they can,"" Scott Roxborough, EU bureau chief for The Hollywood Reporter, told Agence France-Presse. ""But it's a question as to whether it was necessary or sensible to do it.""He said Berlin, as the first major global cinema showcase of the year, was trying to live up to a responsibility to promote daring new movies against the odds.""There's been a massive success of the latest 'Spiderman' - one of the most successful films of all time now - despite the pandemic,"" he said.He said independent films, by contrast, had suffered.""I think that's making the industry very concerned about the future,"" Roxborough said.Agence France-Presse",LIFE,CULTURE,Posters for the Berlin film festival Photo: AFP,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'Berlin': ('LOC', 1), 'Germany': ('LOC', 2), 'US': ('LOC', 2), 'France': ('LOC', 1), 'Italy': ('LOC', 2), 'South Korea': ('LOC', 1), 'China': ('LOC', 1), 'EU': ('ORG', 1), 'Berlinale': ('ORG', 3), 'Sixth Sense': ('ORG', 1), 'Bear': ('ORG', 1), 'Golden Bear': ('MISC', 1), 'COD': ('MISC', 1), '19': ('MISC', 1), 'India': ('MISC', 1), 'Dark Glasses': ('MISC', 1), 'Wolfgang Buechner': ('PER', 1), 'Carlo Chatrian': ('PER', 1), 'Nick Cave': ('PER', 1), 'M.

82,"Furthest from Ukraine frontline, Washington is most eager for war: Global Times editorial",Global Times,2022-02-07,"US President Joe Biden recently approved the deployment of 3,000 US troops to the eastern part of EU. The first batch has arrived in Germany and Poland. This is an eye-offending move the US made after it withdrew its troops from Afghanistan and Iraq. The Pentagon previously announced that 8,500 US troops are placed on heightened alert to possibly deploy to EU. In addition, NATO defense ministers will discuss further reinforcements at their next meeting on February 16 and 17. Although these troops are not deployed directly in Ukraine, the move has de facto made people think EU is on the brink of war. US, it must be noted, is furthest away from the Ukraine frontline but it is most eager for a war, while both Russia and Ukraine have repeatedly announced they have no intention of going to war or solving their problems by force. Ukraine's president and defense minister publicly stated that the situation is not as tense as the US has portrayed. But US, which is far away from the region, has been hyping that war is on the verge of breaking out. US media Bloomberg has even released fake news that ""Live: Russia Invades Ukraine."" The US has not only fanned the flames of public opinion, but also provided arms to Ukraine and enhanced military deployment around the EU country. The US' intention is to urge Ukraine to ""hold on"" and not ""fall behind"" in its confrontation with Russia. US intends to instigate wars, in a bid to increase the legitimacy of NATO's existence and the bloc's internal cohesion to tie EU - which has shown some signs of departing from US - more tightly to the US. Some other analysts say the US can take the opportunity to sell arms - a reasonable suspicion based on history. In short, the US is trying to hit various birds with one stone, but it is playing an immoral and dangerous game. The New York Times reported that ""even many reliably hawkish voices in both parties show no appetite for seeing US troops fight and potentially die for Ukraine."" The US is pushing Ukraine into the firing line, but it itself has jumped aside to avoid being implicated.One of US's aims is to make Russia feel uncomfortable, but Ukraine is very likely to become the victim. Anyone with a discerning eye can figure out that the last thing Ukraine really needs is arms. The US' donating or selling weapons to Ukraine cannot change the military balance between Russia and Ukraine. What Ukraine does need is a peaceful and stable internal and external environment. The country has to focus on developing its economy, improving people's livelihoods, and easing tensions with Russia. If the US ""stands with Ukraine"" as it has claimed, it should have provided Ukraine the necessary and substantial help in these fields. It needs to be underlined that the most difficult thing for Ukraine to withstand right now is to add fuel to the fire, but US has repeatedly ""created"" opportunities to escalate the situation between Russia and Ukraine.In this context, the latest joint statement that China and Russia has released also triggered the US' scruples. White House press secretary Jen Psaki ""warns"" Beijing that if an armed conflict breaks out between Russia and Ukraine, it ""would impact China's interests all over the world."" The US' such move is like nitpicking with China. This China-Russia document covers broad consensus and common demands on economy and trade, security, regional situation and global order, and it does not even mention Ukraine. US's vision is clearly too low to see the real landscape of today's world. It is now more like a ""class representative"" of old thinking, proudly flaunting its lies with an old trumpet from the last century. They believe they are smarter than everyone else, but they are giving themselves too much credit.In fact, the China-Russia joint statement stated clearly: ""Peace, development and cooperation lie at the core of the modern international system… and the international community is showing a growing demand for the leadership aiming at peaceful and gradual development."" Against this backdrop, US still intends to impair other countries and maintain its hegemony by instigating wars. This is a staggering geopolitical daydream. To wake up from such a pipe dream, the bunch of political elites in US should carefully read this joint statement and understand how to make the US conform to the trend of the times and become a truly responsible power.",OPINION,EDITORIAL,"US troops deploy for Europe from Pope Army Airfield at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, on February 3, 2022.

83,"China denounces US’ groundless accusations against China’s internal affairs, saying athletes should be in the spotlight of the Games",Global Times,2022-02-07,"
China's Permanent Representative to the UN (UN) denounced the US Ambassador to the UN for making groundless accusations against China on Sunday. Athletes from China, the US and other countries are competing fairly at the Winter Olympic Games. They are the ones that should be in the spotlight, and the US politicians should have left the stage for them long ago, China UN Ambassador said.US Ambassador to the UN Linda Thomas-Greenfield had an interview with Jake Tapper on CNN's ""State of the Union"" on Saturday, where she made irresponsible and wrong remarks on the Beijing Winter Olympic Games, Xinjiang-related issues and the Taiwan question. When asked how she interpreted the fact that one of the two athletes that lit the torch was from China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, Greenfield said that ""it is an effort by the China to distract US from the real issue here at hand, that Uyghurs are being tortured.""China's Permanent Representative to the UN Zhang Jun refuted that Greenfield's groundless and politically-biased words have seriously poisoned the China-US relations. Facing such a smear campaign, China has no choice but to push back and clarify our position and reject the unfounded accusations by the US.Zhang stressed that the Winter Olympic Games has successfully kicked off. The opening ceremony was attended by around 170 official representatives from nearly 70 countries and international organizations, including 31 heads of state, heads of government, members of the royal family, and heads of international organizations. Many more state leaders and heads of international organizations have called or sent letters to President Xi Jinping to wish the Winter Olympic Games a great success and the China people a happy Lunar New Year. This fully shows the international community's firm support for China, for the Winter Olympic Games, and for the Olympic Movement. The US attempt to make an issue of the Winter Olympic Games has won no support and met with complete failure.Zhang stressed that in Team China, there are 20 athletes from 9 ethnic minorities, including Uygur and Tibetan. One of them is Dinigeer Yilamujiang, a Uygur cross-country skier who lit the Olympic caldron. She is the pride and excellent representative of the China people. On what ground does the US has such inexplicable anger over this? And why?  Zhang questioned.In her interview with the CNN, Greenfield also made irresponsible remarks concerned China's internal affairs. She not only compared the Taiwan question to the Ukraine border issue, but also said that ""[the US is] committed to protecting the security and supporting the security of the people of Taiwan while at the same time our policy has always been to recognize the One China policy.""As a response, Zhang said that the future of the island of Taiwan lies in national reunification, not some security guarantee from the US. The US should stop emboldening and supporting the ""Taiwan independence"" forces, follow the true one-China policy, and match its actions with words. Otherwise, playing fire on the Taiwan question will only end up getting burned.Zhang pointed out that the US is facing serious political, economic, social, security and public health issues. Under such circumstances, the US politicians need to heed the voice of the people and solve its own problems, instead of being trapped in the mindset of US supremacy over everything, still less shifting responsibilities, creating confrontations or obstructing other countries' development, Zhang said. ""Here is my advice to the US: Do not go further down the wrong path.

84,'Huge uncertainties' exist on Blinken's Asia tour; US to make Quad more integrated 'impossible',GT staff reporters,2022-02-06,"US Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Monday will embark on his tour to the Asia-Pacific region for the Quad meeting in an attempt to push back against China's expanding influence. However, experts on Sunday said huge uncertainties linger for reaching any consensus with real meaning among Asia countries, and that forming the Quad into a more integrated or stronger alliance is impossible.Experts believe Antony Blinken's tour amid a mounting crisis over Ukraine implies the US still places going against China as its top priority. However, the USs scheme to promote economy-related affairs within the security mechanism to target China may not allure Quad members due to doubts toward the US. Other than pointing fingers at China's internal affairs, any consensus with real meaning is not expected to be reached, experts predicted. During his tour next week, Antony Blinken is scheduled to have talks with Indo-Pacific allies, including a meeting of foreign ministers of the four-nation Quad, according to the US State Department. The Quad meeting, with members the US, Japan, India and Australia, will be held in Australia. Antony Blinken is scheduled to depart US on Monday, and stay in Australia from February 9 to 12 for the Quad meeting. Later, he will visit Fiji before heading to Hawaii to meet with his Japan and South Korea counterparts to discuss the North Korea issue.Antony Blinken still decided to visit Asia in spite of the severe situation in Ukraine implies that the focal point of US strategy targeting China remain unchanged, Xin Qiang, deputy director of the Center for US Studies at Fudan University, told the Global Times on Sunday.One of the top items for the Quad meeting is whether the US will promote agendas like the economy within the Quad mechanism as the Joe Biden administration said last year the US deeply believes every agenda could be taken to launch competition with China, Li Haidong, a professor from the Institute of International Relations of China Foreign Affairs University, told the Global Times.However, there are many uncertainties over whether the assumption from the US can be realized as it has wished, and whether the US can consolidate the quadripartite security dialogue mechanism and run it effectively, Li said. No matter what the Joe Biden administration does, odds are great that the policy would be changed significantly if Joe Biden's Democrats lose the midterm elections in November and if the 2024 presidential election brings in a new Republican administration which advocates economic protectionism, Li explained. Such uncertainty is clear to all other Quad members, thus the USs plan of adopting economy-related affairs within the security mechanism to target China may not reach consensus, Li noted.Xin predicted it is likely the Quad will release statements on China's internal affairs, including China Sea and the Taiwan question as it usually does after a meeting, but the group moving forward to an integration and stronger alliance is impossible.Xin explained that China constitutes no threat to the countries within the Quad, even as China is continuing to add impetus to its economy, thus, it is unlikely that Japan, India or Australia will opt to become the spearhead of the US to entirely go against China.Antony Blinken's visit to Asia comes amid the mounting crisis over Ukraine. ""We can tell from Antony Blinken's trip that the US is clear the Ukraine crisis is not as dire as US media has been hyping, which has hyped the lie that 'Russia invaded Ukraine.' Meddling in Ukraine issues is more like leverage for the US to gain influence in EU,"" Xin said. He noted that for the US, a chaotic Ukraine will benefit itself to rope in EU allies and at the same time pressure Russia.",CHINA,DIPLOMACY,"U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken testifies before U.S. House Committee on Foreign Affairs on the Biden Administration's Priorities for U.S. Foreign Policy on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C., on March 10, 2021.(Photo: Xinhua)",Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'US': ('LOC', 11), 'Asia': ('LOC', 3), 'Pacific': ('LOC', 2), 'China': ('LOC', 7), 'Ukraine': ('LOC', 2), 'Indo': ('LOC', 1), 'Japan': ('LOC', 2), 'India': ('LOC', 1), 'Australia': ('LOC', 3), 'Fiji': ('LOC', 1), 'Hawaii': ('LOC', 1), 'South Korea': ('LOC', 1), 'North Korea': ('LOC', 1), 'Antony Blinken': ('PER', 5), 'Xin Qiang': ('PER', 1), 'Joe Biden': ('PER', 3), 'Q': ('MISC', 2), 'Democrats': ('MISC', 1), 'Republican': ('MISC', 1), 'US State Department': ('ORG', 1), 'Center for US Studies': ('ORG', 1), 'Fudan University': ('ORG', 1), 'Global Times': ('ORG', 2), 'Li': ('ORG', 2), 'Institute': ('ORG', 1), 'B': ('ORG', 2)}"
85,China starts busy diplomacy season with over 30 foreign dignitaries in Beijing for Olympics,GT staff reporters,2022-02-04,"The tarmac of the Beijing Capital International Airport is seeing its busiest time in the last two days with more than 30 foreign dignitaries arriving in Beijing for the opening ceremony of the Beijing Winter Olympic Games, as China kicked off a busy and crucial round of diplomatic activities to improve relations, promote multilateralism and call for global unity in dealing with global and regional challenges. On Friday afternoon, Russia President Vladimir Putin arrived to attend the Winter Olympic Games and met with China President Xi Jinping to discuss closer cooperation.On Friday morning, many dignitaries also arrived in Beijing, including Argentine President Alberto Fernandez, Serbia President Aleksandar Vucic and Abu Dhabi Crown Prince Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan. 

World leaders gathering at Beijing Winter Olympic Games. Graphic: Xu Zihe/GTAt least 32 foreign heads of state, heads of government, members of royal families and heads of international organizations attended the opening ceremony of the Games, and many of them arrived in Beijing on Thursday. With foreign dignitaries attending the Winter Olympic Games, China also started one of its most important diplomatic activities this year to improve cooperation with partners, help coordinate heated regional concerns and above all, promote multilateralism and global cooperation in dealing with challenges, analysts said, noting that this also shows China's capacity to unify others amid challenging times. The dignitaries attended the opening ceremony of the Winter Olympic Games this year under unique circumstances - it is being held as the world is wandering at the crossroads and thinking of future ways amid an unprecedented crisis, Yang Xiyu, a senior research fellow at the China Institute of International Studies in Beijing, told the Global Times on Friday. Yang noted that the world is still suffering from COVID-19 pandemic, the global economy is experiencing a downward trend with more uncertainties and risks, the sustainability of humans is facing challenges with threats of climate change, and instead of being united, the world is falling into more confrontations amid the USs Cold War mentality. The leaders of the WHO and the UN also came to attend the event, which shows that athletes and dignitaries gathered in Beijing not only to enjoy the sports event but also to send a strong voice of greater unity.UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, President of the UN Abdulla Shahid, WHO Director-General Dr. Tedros Ghebreyesus and World Intellectual Property Organization Director-General Daren Tang arrived in Beijing on Thursday evening. To convey the message that the Olympic spirit of ""Faster, Higher, Stronger"" can only be carried by solidarity, leaders of international organizations participated in the torch relay in Beijing on Friday, including President of the International Olympic Committee Thomas Bach, Ban Ki-moon, the eighth Secretary-General of the UN, Shahid and Tedros. ""The Olympic Flame is a symbol of tolerance, solidarity and hope. I was honored to join the Olympic Torch Relay for the Winter Olympic Games… I call on everyone to come together to cherish the Olympic ideals of friendship, respect and excellence,"" Shahid tweeted on Friday, posing videos of himself in the relay. Siddharth Chatterjee, resident coordinator of UN China, told the Global Times on Friday that Guterres is in Beijing for the opening ceremony of the Winter Olympic Games. He met the UN Country Coordinator in China today and spoke about his common agenda, which is designed to strengthen and accelerate multilateral agreements - particularly the 2030 Agenda - and make a tangible difference in people's lives.Against the backdrop of the world calling for solidarity, China is holding the Winter Olympic Games and injected new meaning to boost the world. The Winter Olympic Games is sending positive energy and pointing to the right direction for unity and cooperation, analysts said. Most of the countries that have come to support China have maintained close economic relations or high political trust with China and the meetings between top leaders and bilateral activities are expected to increase consensuses for better cooperation in many fields, including cooperation under the Belt and Road Initiative, Li Haidong, a professor at the Institute of International Relations of the China Foreign Affairs University, told the Global Times. Countries will also take this opportunity to share their views on topics related to international politics and security, on how to promote justice, fairness and inclusiveness in the current economic and international order, and on how to better embrace peace and development, Li said. Analysts noted that heated regional issues may also be topics for such a multilateral platform in Beijing as some West media outlets speculated whether there will be discussions on the Ukraine issue during the Winter Olympic Games. China has fully demonstrated the Olympic spirit not only in bidding for the Games but in preparing and holding it, which reflects China's positive influence in the international community and its contributions to world peace and development, Li said, noting that such a positive international image has improved China's influence.",CHINA,DIPLOMACY,Photo: Li Hao/GT,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'Beijing Capital International Airport': ('LOC', 7), 'China': ('LOC', 4), 'Russia': ('LOC', 1), 'Serbia': ('LOC', 1), 'Abu Dhabi': ('LOC', 1), 'US': ('LOC', 1), 'Beijing Winter Olympic Games': ('MISC', 3), 'Winter Olympic Games': ('MISC', 4), 'Argentine': ('MISC', 1), 'COVID': ('MISC', 1), '19': ('MISC', 1), 'World': ('MISC', 1), 'Vladimir Putin': ('PER', 1), 'Xi Jinping': ('PER', 1), 'Alberto Fernandez': ('PER', 1), 'Aleksandar Vucic': ('PER', 1), 'Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan': ('PER', 1), 'Xu Zihe': ('PER', 1), 'Yang Xiyu': ('PER', 2), 'Antonio G': ('PER', 2), 'Abdul': ('PER', 1), 'Shah': ('PER', 1), 'Ted': ('PER', 1), 'Dare': ('PER', 1), 'Tang': ('PER', 1), 'GTA': ('ORG', 1), 'China Institute of International Studies': ('ORG', 1), 'Global Times': ('ORG', 1), 'WHO': ('ORG', 2), 'UN': ('ORG', 3), 'Intel': ('ORG', 1), 'Organization': ('ORG', 1)}"
86,"Xi-Putin meeting in Beijing: eye to eye, back to back",Yuri Tavrovsky,2022-02-03,"Winter Olympic Games will open on February 4, and a new stage of China-Russia relations will begin. President Xi Jinping and President Vladimir Putin will meet face to face for the first time in two years on the sidelines of a major global sporting event. Of all the Olympic sports, the biathlon is best suited to express the meaning of this meeting.A list of priority topics for discussion is prepared for the two presidents. There are many impressive successes. The China-Russia Treaty of Good-Neighborliness and Friendly Cooperation, which was to expire this February, has been extended for another five years. Bilateral trade in 2021 reached a record of nearly $150 billion. Defense ministers for the first time approved the joint roadmap for the development of military cooperation from 2021 to 2025. China and Russia strategic bombers continue to patrol the vicinity of US bases in Japan and South Korea in general formation. For the first time, scientists have agreed to jointly build the International Lunar Research Station. The ""comprehensive strategic partnership of coordination for a new era,"" which Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin agreed on, is being filled with concrete content.There are still some problems. So far, bottlenecks in finance have not been eliminated. It is not yet possible to achieve mutual recognition of COVID-19 vaccines, which leads to a virtual ban on communication between Russia and China and a reduction in flights and road traffic. These problems that naturally arise in the relations of the two neighboring countries are waiting to be solved during their top leaders' meeting.In addition to the preparations of their diplomats and advisors, Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin will discuss much more complex issues. Looking eye to eye, they will talk about the cold war waged against China and Russia by the US and its allies. On both fronts, the Eastern and West, the red lines have already been reached and it is quite possible that they will be accidentally or deliberately crossed. The island of Taiwan and Ukraine are being ""pumped up"" with weapons; they are being pushed to suicidal actions by more and more formidable resolutions and promises of support ""in case of emergency."" What will be the actions of China and Russia ""in case of emergency,"" what forms of diplomatic, informational, economic or even military support can be counted on? This may become the main topic of the meeting.Fearing the already reached level of China-Russia strategic partnership and trying to prevent new forms of interaction, US is trying to sow distrust between the two nations. This, in particular, can explain the surge in US's diplomatic activity in the Russia direction. It's expected that Vladimir Putin will tell Xi Jinping about the content of recent contacts and convince him that there is not even a thought of a ""double play."" Twenty years of experience with US leaders have led the Kremlin leader to assume complete unreliability of any promises from US. His 20 years of experience with China leaders and, especially, almost a decade of communication with Xi Jinping, have proven China's trustworthiness.Faced with the US' unprecedented hostility, the China, too, are shedding their last illusions. Increasingly, they are coming to the conclusion that the irrational rejection of all things China in the US stems from a powerful layer of Sinophobia in the collective mindset of the US society. On this basis stands the anti-China policy of the White House and both major parties, who argue about everything except their shared hatred of the Middle Kingdom. Sinophobia, like Russophobia, is explained by the desire to destroy any rivals of the ""shining house on the hill"" who question the US ""God-given natural right to rule."" It is possible to trade with such partners, but not to build sustainable relationships.In the context of intense diplomatic games between Moscow and US, an increase of trust should be the main result of the Olympic meeting between Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin. The main outcome of the upcoming meeting can already be predicted. China and Russia will not yet become a single ""biathlon team,"" but will continue to confront opponents ""back to back.""  The author is head of the China Dream and Russia Dream Analytical Center. opinion@globaltimes.com.cn",OPINION,VIEWPOINT,China Russia Photo:VCG,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'Winter Olympic Games': ('MISC', 2), 'China -': ('MISC', 1), 'Treaty of Good - Neiborliness and Friendly Cooperation': ('MISC', 1), 'COVID': ('MISC', 1), '19': ('MISC', 1), 'China': ('LOC', 6), 'Russia': ('LOC', 7), 'US': ('LOC', 3), 'Japan': ('LOC', 1), 'South Korea': ('LOC', 1), 'Eastern': ('LOC', 1), 'West': ('LOC', 1), 'Taiwan': ('LOC', 1), 'Ukraine': ('LOC', 1), 'Xi Jinping': ('PER', 3), 'Vladimir Putin': ('PER', 3), 'International Lunar Research Station': ('ORG', 1)}"
87,"China, Russia are ‘stabilizers for challenging world’, Xi-Putin meeting to address critical issues, may ink new deals: experts",Chen Qingqing,2022-02-03," A day ahead of the opening ceremony of the Winter Olympic Games 2022, Russia President Vladimir Putin told China media that the meeting of the heads of state plays a crucial role in the close cooperation between Moscow and Beijing on the basis of mutual political trust. President Vladimir Putin noted the two nations will play a pivotal role to safeguard stability in today's challenging world. Vladimir Putin, at the invitation of China President Xi Jinping, will visit Beijing on February 4 and will be present at the opening ceremony of the Winter Olympic Games the same day, and the two leaders will hold in-depth talks covering a wide range of bilateral and international issues. Vladimir Putin is the first foreign head of state who confirmed his presence at the 2022 Games last year. China experts consider him as the most important guest to the event, given there's no limit for China-Russia friendship, and two leaders will discuss how to build up the two countries' strong partnership, and respond to a series of ""unharmonious"" challenges, like the Ukraine situation.Vladimir Putin said in a written reply to the Xinhua News Agency that the two leaders will discuss international topics, as foreign policy coordination between the two countries is based on close and coinciding approaches to solving global and regional issues. ""Our countries play an important stabilizing role in today's challenging international environment, promoting greater democracy in the system of international relations to make it more equitable and inclusive,"" he wrote. Amid escalating global tensions which have directly affected China and Russia, the two countries have seen fruitful cooperation in various domains including bilateral trade, expansion of settlements in national currencies to offset the impact of the US' unilateral sanctions, energy, information technologies, as well as space exploration and vaccine cooperation. Also, the two countries are actively cooperating on a number of multilateral frameworks including BRICS, the Russia-India-China framework, the Shanghai Cooperation Organization and G20, all of which serve as stabilizers for the challenging global situation. Not only do China and Russia share high-level strategic partnerships and mutual trust, the top leaders of the two countries also share a close personal relationship. Since 2013, President Xi Jinping and President Vladimir Putin have met each other about 30 times on various occasions, which is rare in global diplomacy. Besides the official meetings, the two also shared some close moments like enjoying vodka, caviar and Russia ice cream and celebrating each other's birthdays.President Vladimir Putin praised President Xi Jinping in an earlier media interview, saying the China President is a world-class politician with rich knowledge and is always well prepared for any event. Vladimir Putin, sending out the message before his arrival in Beijing, shows that Russia attaches great importance to its relations with China, which fully underscores that there's no limit to further development of their strategic partnership in the future, Yang Jin, an associate research fellow at the Institute of Russia, EU and Central Asia Studies at the China Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times on Thursday. ""Amid the pandemic and the US-led so-called 'diplomatic boycott', Vladimir Putin's visit displays Russia's full support for Beijing holding the Games, and, for the Olympic Spirit,"" Yang said. Vladimir Putin said that it is symbolic that his meeting with President Xi Jinping will take place during the Spring Festival -- the China Lunar New Year. ""After all, as the China saying goes, 'The whole year's work depends on a good start in spring',"" Vladimir Putin said. Some China experts believed that the two leaders may sign a joint statement including Russia's strong support for the Winter Olympic Games, and strong coordination between China and Russia to tackle international challenges -- whatever they are.""The two leaders are likely to discuss global issues of common concern such as the NATO's eastward expansion, the Iran nuclear issue, global climate change and stability in the Korean Peninsula,"" Yang said. As the pandemic continues to rage around the world, the tensions over Ukraine have yet to be eased. The US President Joe Biden ordered 2,000 US-based troops to Poland and Germany and shifted 1,000 more from Germany to Romania, the AP reported on Wednesday. China and Russia will discuss from ""the pragmatic perspective"" on how to respond to a series of ""unharmonious"" events, and tackle issues like the Ukraine situation, where Russia is facing intensifying pressure from the US-led NATO, Li Haidong, a professor at the Institute of International Relations of the China Foreign Affairs University, told the Global Times on Thursday. ""As global observers are concerned about the elusive situation in Ukraine, President Vladimir Putin is expected to discuss with President Xi Jinping Russia's position on the important issue, as well as on how to advance the development of global governance,"" Li said.In addition to geopolitical issues, Russia and China will likely talk about concrete deals, Reuters reported on Thursday, citing Kremlin aide Yuri Ushakov, including a discussion on closer gas and financial ties between the two countries. Ushakov said the possibility of Russia building a new gas pipeline to China through Mongolia was being looked at, a project that has been discussed for a long time and would take years to realize.In the written article published by Xinhua, Vladimir Putin said a mutually beneficial energy partnership is being formed between the two countries. Along with long-term oil and gas supplies to China, Russia has plans to implement a number of large-scale joint projects, and the construction of four new power units at China nuclear power plants with the participation of Rosatom State Corporation. ""All this significantly strengthens the energy security of China and the Asia region as a whole,"" Vladimir Putin wrote. There's greater cooperation potential between China and Russia in advancing their trade and economies. The close energy partnership and the planned development of Siberia and Russia Far East, tell that Russia has consciously aligned its economic and social development plans and major development projects with China, reflecting an even-stronger and mutually beneficial economic partnership, Li said.The two countries have strong demand to enhance cooperation in energy, finance, agriculture and infrastructure in the post-COVID-19 era, Yang said, adding that the upcoming talks between the two presidents will likely ink more practical cooperation projects, and may cover extensive advancement of the Belt and Road initiative.While Beijing is set to hold the grand opening ceremony of the Games, the whole world awaits the moment when Beijing becomes the first city in the world to hold both summer and Winter Olympic Games. Vladimir Putin said he is convinced that China's extensive experience and its excellent organization of representative international competitions will make it possible to hold this global festival of sports at the highest level. However, the US is leading some of its close allies to ""diplomatically boycott"" the Games. Such attempts won't succeed, Vladimir Putin said, as it is fundamentally wrong and contrary to the very spirit and principles of the Olympic Charter.",CHINA,DIPLOMACY,File photo:Xinhua,"Reporter, Beijing","Chen Qingqing co-leads the Global Times China desk.

We welcome the visit of our old friend, said Wang.Wang said that under the leadership of Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin, China and Russia held grand celebration of the 20th anniversary of signing of China-Russia Treaty of Good-Neighborliness and Friendly Cooperation last year. The strategic cooperation between the two countries is going deeper and becoming more pragmatic, said Wang, noting that the two countries have shown firmer confidence in safeguarding core interests, achieved more fruitful results in mutually beneficial cooperation as well as have seen effective measures in tackling challenges.  Now that China and Russia have ushered in new development opportunities, China is willing to meet Russia halfway and to implement consensus of two state leaders to deepen cooperation between the two countries, unwaveringly safeguard global equality and justice as well as bring benefits to two peoples, said Wang. Wang also noted that advancing the Belt and Road Initiative to connect with the Eurasian Economic Union is an important consensus reached by two state leaders, and the two countries have achieved strong initial results and that China is willing to strengthen connectivity with Russia, and actively push forward cooperation across the upstream, midstream and downstream industrial chain cooperation in the energy sector.    Now that all the obstacles for pragmatic cooperation between the countries caused by COVID-19 have been addressed, said Wang, noting the two sides should ensure normal exchanges between people and in trade, to push forwardthe  bilateral practical cooperation, said Wang. Lavrov also said that he is happy to visit old friends in China during the China Lunar New Year. The two state leaders' meeting on Friday will push relation between China and Russia closer, which carries significant meaning for building modern international relations system and global sustainable development. He noted that the two countries have carried out high level strategic cooperation and close coordination, which is not affected by the international situation and helps boost stability and predictability into international relations. The opening ceremony of Winter Olympic Games is kicking off tomorrow, said Lavrov, noting that Beijing will be the first city to hold both the Summer and Winter Olympic Games. The world will witness China's extraordinary ability in hosting the global sports feast after overcoming the impact of the pandemic. The two sides agreed to stick to the Olympic spirit and oppose politicization of the event. They have also committed to upholding peace and stability within Asia Pacific and opposed any attempt to create antagonism and confrontation among camps and groups.Russia also briefed the China side on the new development in Russia-US relations and Russia-NATO relations, and stressed its own stance on the issue, to which China expressed understanding and support. The two sides also aligned their position on international and regions issues of common concern including the BRICS cooperation, Ukraine, Afghanistan and the Korean Peninsula issues. The two later signed documents outlining diplomatic cooperation. Global Times.",CHINA,DIPLOMACY,Photo:fmprc.gov.cn,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'China': ('LOC', 10), 'Russia': ('LOC', 8), 'Xi Jinping': ('PER', 2), 'Vladimir Putin': ('PER', 2), 'Wang Yi': ('PER', 9), 'Sergey Lavrov': ('PER', 2), 'La': ('PER', 1), 'Luna': ('PER', 1), 'Council': ('ORG', 1), 'Belt and Road Initiative': ('ORG', 1), 'Eurasian Economic Union': ('ORG', 1), 'China Lunar New Year': ('MISC', 2), 'China - Russia Treaty of Good - Neiborliness and Friendly Cooperation': ('MISC', 1)}"
89,Beijing 2022: in-between geopolitical greed and humanity’s highest ambition,Fabio Massimo Parenti,2022-02-01,"Unifying, not dividing, this is the real mission and spirit of the Winter Olympic Games since their foundation in ancient Greece. Winter Olympic Games is not an exception, but a confirmation of the authentic spirit of the Games, as the slogan says ""together for a shared future"".  We all know the US, UK and few other countries' attempts to ""pollute"" this event with their sclerotic scheme of containing China's influence in the world, and with their paranoia on China successful development at home and abroad. The result? They failed, whilst the world is opening its arms to Beijing. Most of the world's population knows that Beijing is determined to enhance peaceful cooperation between peoples: it is a goal, an ambition, which remains the guiding principle of China's work in the world (see my upcoming book, in China and English, The China Pathway).Thanks to these Games, we can further underline the values of solidarity, unity and cooperation between peoples, values that drive the efforts, sacrifices and ambitions of athletes from all over the world. Beijing 2022 can also represent a virtuous model for the next Winter Olympic Games to be held in Cortina d'Ampezzo (Belluno), Italy. The latter is an aspect that links Italy and China in a new form of cooperation centered on the values of cooperation and solidarity between peoples using winter sports. There have been many exchanges between the two countries, as Ambassador Li Junhua recalled in a video message shown at the beginning of a Conference held in Rome earlier in January, 2022.Trying to boycott and bashing China with respect to the Winter Olympic Games is other evidence of the US-UK alliance's anachronistic and irresponsible behaviors, and an indication of their dominant imperialistic attitude. However, as said, they are failing, just another time… as happened in their failed attempt to blame China for the pandemic, whilst they have failed at home since the beginning. We could add examples over examples. Only more recently, they failed in their plan to create a fake casus belli in Xinjiang or in their alleged attempt to ""stabilize"" Afghanistan, and they will fail in their attempts to exploit problems from Ukraine to Kazakhstan and Taiwan in order to fulfil their inhumane geopolitical purposes. Politicizing Winter Olympic Games goes against the universal humanity's values as it is a way to waste unique opportunities to create a peaceful and supportive environment for the benefit of the world population. Something we need even more after two years of pandemic suffering. On one hand, we have arrogant and warmongering countries, which are adding problems to the already existing global challenges, e.g. severe social, economic, health and environmental problems in an imperialistic approach that shows they do not care about people. On the other hand, we have nations that work to enhance cooperation between people in order to build a community with a share future for humanity. This is a self-evident reality, no one can honestly negate.  Avoiding falling in the US-UK provocations, China marks its international responsibility as a civilized state open to the world. China was successful in hosting 2008 Summer Games and will be successful in the new Winter Olympic Games. For the first time in Olympic history, China will rely on renewable energy sources, thanks to specific sustainable development techniques to reduce emissions of pollutants. In the Capital Gymnasium in Beijing, which will host figure skating events, we will see the production of ice using carbon dioxide as a refrigerant. Solar and wind energy will power the Zhangbei area. Every attempt to work against the real significance of the Games and good practices that can emerge is destined to fail. China has worked hard to guarantee green, sustainable and inclusive Winter Olympic Games. The author is associate professor of International Studies at CFAU, Beijing, teaching also at the International Institute Lorenzo de' Medici, Florence.

90,US itself should put out the fire it set in Ukraine: Global Times editorial,Global Times,2022-01-29,"US Undersecretary of State for Political Affairs Victoria Nuland on Thursday called on Beijing ""to use its influence with Moscow"" to urge a diplomatic solution to the Ukraine crisis. Nuland also said ""if there is a conflict in Ukraine it is not going to be good for China either,"" as ""there will be a significant impact on the global economy"" and in the energy sphere. On the same day, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken requested a phone conversation with China's State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi, during which the US mainly talked about the Ukraine issue. Antony Blinken underscored the risks posed by ""further Russia aggression against Ukraine"" and conveyed that ""de-escalation and diplomacy are the responsible way forward."" US is trying to create such a public opinion impression that the US is working hard to alleviate the crisis. It wants to kick the ball to Russia and China, making them bear the responsibility while shaping the US as a good man. After US set a fire in Ukraine, it has pretended to be a victim and imagines China to ""persuade"" Russia to put it out. It must be pointed out that US is blowing smoke to reverse the cause and the effect. The root cause of the Ukraine issue is that the US has promoted NATO's eastward expansion unrestrainedly, thus pushing Russia into a corner where there is no way to retreat. US is the culprit of the crisis. The US now hopes China will ""persuade"" Russia. In essence it wants China to urge Moscow to make a concession. The perfect plan US desires is that Moscow will cooperate unconditionally with the US' geopolitical ambitions. How absurd and ridiculous its logic is! US is the root cause for many major regional crises aside from the Ukraine issue. The Korean Peninsula nuclear crisis, Iran nuclear issue, and the Afghan chaos caused by the US troops' withdrawal last year are the ""hornet's nests"" stirred up by the US. When the US messes up a region and finds it unable to clean up the situation, it hopes to draw other countries into paying for its mistakes. In recent years, US has expected China's participation in the resolution of almost all major international crises. On one hand, it has done its utmost to crack down on China, and on the other, it has had the temerity to seek China's help. This is the case this time. The US is carrying out strategic suppression on China in the Asia-Pacific region as it is doing with Russia while at the same time it hopes China will urge Russia to make a concession. It hopes to take all the benefits while doing bad things. When handling regional conflicts, the biggest difference between China and the US is that China seeks peaceful solutions but the US seeks chaos. China has never kidnapped the collective interests of the region for its own interests, but instead, has always taken a responsible attitude and looked for a solution based on facts. China has never shied away from making mediation efforts within its capacity. It doesn't choose to act or not act simply because it has a good relationship or a competition with some other country. China has pursued an independent foreign policy and always respects other countries' independence. It makes active efforts to push relevant parties to return to the negotiating table and take care of all parties' security concerns to find the greatest common ground in complicated situations. From our point of view, to ease tensions in Ukraine, it is the US that has the most room for action. US should first stop making provocations in this region, and let EU solve its own security problems. While rejecting Russia's legitimate concerns on the issue of NATO's eastward expansion, the US continues to step up efforts to create tension - withdrawing US diplomats in Ukraine, and continuing to send weapons to Ukraine. Because Germany refused to be the follower of the US this time, US opinion accused it of being a ""traitor"" of the West. The US clearly sees itself as the plenipotentiary of EU. After the end of World War II, the US and the West have been unrestrainedly emphasizing and expanding so-called collective defense, even at the cost of global strategic stability. However, it turns out that the more they pursue collective defense, the more the safety of members outside the small circles is damaged, and the more they have to strengthen their own security. Consequently, the US and the West have fallen into a curse of ""the safer they want to be, the less safe they are,"" which has caused crises one after another. If US's ultra-strategic selfishness remains unrestrained, then even if the Ukraine crisis reaches a soft landing, the next crisis awaits. To solve the Ukraine crisis, if we are to play a mediating role, we would like to advise US that ""whoever hung the bell on the tiger's neck must untie it."" It should give up the zero-sum game and the Cold War mentality as soon as possible, and use the correct method to put out the fire it set.",OPINION,EDITORIAL,"A Ukrainian Military Forces serviceman peers through a spyglass in a dugout on the frontline near Gorlivka, Donetsk region on January 23, 2022.

91,32 world leaders to attend Beijing Olympics amid bankruptcy of US' boycott calls,Zhang Hui,2022-01-28,"China President Xi Jinping will attend the opening ceremony of the Winter Olympic Games, and hold a welcome banquet for at least 32 foreign heads of state, heads of government, members of the royal family and heads of international organizations, a China Foreign Ministry spokesperson announced on Friday. Such large scale of foreign leaders to the opening ceremony of the Winter Olympic Games - an unprecedented offline gathering of top leaders since the pandemic - underscore China's capacity of unifying others amid challenging time, which also signals the widely shared support and expectations of the global community for the Games and completely defies the trivial voices of the US-led West clique in calling for a ""diplomatic boycott of the Games,"" experts said. It will also be China's first home diplomacy this year, as through bilateral activities, countries are expected to increase consensus and enhance relations with China by celebrating the Olympics and China New Year - the most important China traditional festival. The invited heads of state, heads of government and members of the royal family include six from EU, five from Central Asia, three from the Middle East, two from South US, and others from Asia, the Pacific and Africa, according to the list released on the website of the ministry. President Vladimir Putin of Russia was listed as the first head of state in the list and was also the first foreign leader who confirmed his presence last year. Some experts considered him as the most important guest given there's no limit for China-Russia friendship and considering the current situation.Thomas Bach, president of the International Olympic Committee, UN Secretary-General António Guterres, and WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus are among the heads of the international organizations to be present. In July, fewer than 30 heads of state and other officials of similar stature attended the opening ceremony of Tokyo 2020, which was the fewest on record for a recent Olympics, Japan News reported last year. As the Winter Olympic Games entered the seven-day countdown, there's growing enthusiasm and support for the Games, which is shown not only in the number of attendees but also in a collective voice of the mainstream international community eagerly expecting the Games - the first one to be held as scheduled amid the pandemic, injecting new hope and momentum for the world after two years of struggle against COVID-19. Against the backdrop of the rampant spread of the Omicron variant globally, these leaders chose to come to Beijing for the opening ceremony of the Winter Olympic Games and overcome many difficulties, which showcased their sincerity in firmly supporting China and the Winter Olympic Games, Ruan Zongze, executive vice president of the China Institute of International Studies, told the Global Times on Friday. Holding the Winter Olympic Games as scheduled under the current pandemic also showed China's contribution to the world on promoting global unity, confidence and joint work in overcoming the coronavirus and realizing shared developments, Ruan noted. For instance, to comply with epidemiological safety measures amid the continuing rampage of the virus, President of Kyrgyzstan Sadyr Japarov shifted to remote work ahead of his upcoming visit to China, the press service of the president said on Monday.The large scale of foreign guests to Beijing is also a strong response to the tactics played by a few West countries and the US on calling for a ""boycott"" of the Games, highlighting the failure and unpopularity of the boycott, Ruan noted.

Photo:XinhuaChina's friends circleDing Xiaoxing, director of the Eurasia Institute of the China Institutes of Contemporary International Relations, told the Global Times that 32 visiting dignitaries attending the Winter Olympic Games shows that the international society recognizes and supports China's foreign policy and multilateralism.Amid the impact of the pandemic, China offered a smaller number of invitations to world leaders. But there were still leaders who voluntarily offered to come, Ding said, noting there would be more visiting leaders if China sent invitations to a wider community.Besides South Korea National Assembly Speaker Park Byeong-Seug who will attend the opening ceremony and relevant activities, South Korea Minister of Culture, Sports and Tourism Hwang Hee will lead a government delegation to the upcoming Games, according to media reports. Such high expectations have also been widely shared by a growing number of foreign countries' officials and athletes and sports group representatives. For example, photos and videos circulating on social media showed that the US and Canada teams have departed for Beijing, and groups of athletes expressed excitement. The Winter Olympic Games will be China's first event of home diplomacy at the beginning of 2022, with countries expected to deepen relations with China through high-level meetings, Ding said. For example, leaders of the five Central Asia countries will come to China for the Beijing Games - 10 days after a virtual summit between leaders of China and the five countries on January 25, showing the friendliness between China and its neighbors in the past three decades. These leaders' visit to China will help further boost relations and facilitate future cooperation, especially under the Belt and Road Initiative, analysts said.

Some leaders will come to attend the Beijing Olympics even though their countries have no athletes to the Winter Olympic Games as they know the importance of the Games and they are showing support to the sports spirit, Su Xiaohui, deputy director of the Department for International and Strategic Studies of China Institute of International Studies, told the Global Times.""These countries' sincerity contrasts with a few countries' wretched actions,"" she said.",CHINA,POLITICS,Photo: CFP,"Reporter, Beijing","Global Times reporter covering international relations, politics, public health and science.","{'China': ('LOC', 7), 'Central Asia': ('LOC', 2), 'Middle East': ('LOC', 1), 'South US': ('LOC', 1), 'Pacific': ('LOC', 1), 'Africa': ('LOC', 1), 'Russia': ('LOC', 2), 'Tokyo': ('LOC', 1), 'Japan': ('LOC', 1), 'Beijing': ('LOC', 1), 'Xi Jinping': ('PER', 1), 'Vladimir Putin': ('PER', 1), 'Thomas Bach': ('PER', 1), 'António Guterres': ('PER', 1), 'Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus': ('PER', 1), 'Winter Olympic Games': ('MISC', 7), 'US': ('MISC', 1), 'West': ('MISC', 1), 'Olympics': ('MISC', 2), 'China New Year': ('MISC', 1), 'Olympic Committee': ('MISC', 1), '2020': ('MISC', 1), 'GamesVID': ('MISC', 1), 'O': ('MISC', 1), 'Foreign Ministry': ('ORG', 1), 'EU': ('ORG', 1), 'International': ('ORG', 1), 'UN': ('ORG', 1), 'WHO': ('ORG', 1)}"
92,US camp urged not to fuel Ukraine crisis as Olympic truce takes effect for Beijing 2022,Chen Qingqing,2022-01-28,"World athletes are arriving in Beijing, as the world shares the cheerful atmosphere of the great union of Beijing Winter Olympic Games, which kindles hope for the world which has been struggling with the pandemic and needs solidarity more than ever. On Friday when the UN resolution to observe the Olympic Truce for the upcoming Winter Olympic Games took effect, the risks of regional conflict on the Russia-Ukraine border linger.  The escalating tensions between the US-led West and Russia reminded observers of the Russia-Georgia 2008 war, as the South Ossetia conflict on the heels of the Beijing 2008 Games compromised the ""no war, only peace"" principle of the event.To prevent a similar scenario recurring during the Beijing 2022, experts welcomed the upcoming discussion at the UN on Monday while the US and Russia keep the door open on diplomacy despite that no breakthroughs have been made so far after multiple rounds of talks.Russia said on Thursday it was clear the US was not willing to address its main security concerns in their standoff over Ukraine, but both sides kept the door open for further dialogue, according to Reuters. The comments were made after the US and NATO submitted written responses on Wednesday to Russia's demands for a redrawing of security arrangements in EU, the report said. Meanwhile, the US has requested that the UN meet publicly on Monday to discuss the current situation which could pose a threat to international peace and security. ""As the Winter Olympic Games is around the corner, no one wants to see major conflicts occur during this period, considering the Olympic Spirit. But after rounds of negotiations between Russia and the US, the NATO and OSCE, there are no concrete movements,"" Yang Jin, an associate research fellow at the Institute of Russia, EU and Central Asia Studies at the China Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times on Friday. If there's no effective risk control mechanism put in place, it will be hard to predict how the situation will evolve, which reminds US of the Russia-Georgia conflicts during the Beijing 2008, Yang noted. ""Now it's necessary to take active measures to prevent similar scenarios,"" he said.  The UN adopted the resolution last December for the observance of the Olympic Truce for the Olympic and Paralympic Games Beijing 2022, from January 28 to March 20, 2022. China's Permanent Representative to the UN Zhang Jun said in a tweet that ""let's take this opportunity to promote peace, solidarity, cooperation and other common values shared by all humanity.""While the US on Thursday called on China to use its influence to urge a diplomatic solution to the Ukraine crisis, according to Reuters, China experts said China's stance on the issue has been clear as it was laid out in the latest phone call between China State Councilor Wang Yi and US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, which is to promote diplomatic dialogue to play the role of coordination in multilateral mechanism. The new Minsk agreement, endorsed by the UN, is a basic political document recognized by all parties and should be implemented earnestly. China will support any effort that conforms to the direction and spirit of this agreement, Wang told Antony Blinken. ""In fact, the call for upholding the agreement shows that China hopes the relevant parties to assume necessary responsibilities, for example, the NATO also needs to take its responsibilities and not offend Russia's security strategy by providing advanced weapons to Ukraine,"" Yang said, noting that the West should remain constraint by avoiding any further provocation against Russia. However, when it comes to some reports that said the US called on China to ""use its influence with Russia"" to urge a diplomatic solution over the Ukraine tensions considering the strategically warmed up ties between Russia and China, some China experts said although such call reflected the growing influence of China on global and regional issues, it's unrealistic to rely on China to be a mediator, given that the essence of the current tensions is a geopolitical crisis of EU. Experts also said some West media have been hyping the ""escalating tensions"" in the Ukraine situation, amplifying the role of China and instigating China-Russia relations with fake news.Some observers said US is trying to create such an image in public opinion that the US has been making efforts to ease the tensions, and shift the blame to Russia and China. However, the essence of the Ukraine crisis stems from the unrestricted expansion of NATO fueled by the US. However, the US hopes China persuades Russia compromise confuses the cause and effect.Yang Xiyu, a senior research fellow at the China Institute of International Studies in Beijing, told the Global Times that the US' purpose of urging China to use ""influence"" was to urge China to persuade Russia to back down over the Ukraine issue, which China simply cannot do, as the US' solution on Ukraine was infeasible. The conflict between Russia and Ukraine is a double crisis, Yang Xiyu said. It is a Russia-Ukraine crisis on the surface, but a EU geopolitical crisis in essence, and the question of whether there will be a war between Russia and Ukraine is essentially the question of whether there will be a nuclear war between Russia and the US, Yang Xiyu said.The expert also noted that China wants all parties concerned to return to the Minsk II agreement, and the key was to make the Russia-Ukraine conflict become a bilateral crisis, and separate the geopolitical contradictions in EU with the Russia-Ukraine conflict. The new Minsk Agreement is a basic political document recognized by all parties and should be implemented effectively, Zhao Lijian, spokesperson of the China Foreign Ministry, told a routine press conference on Friday. ""China will support all efforts that conform to the direction and spirit of the agreement. At the same time, we also call on all parties to remain calm and refrain from further stimulating the tensions and hyping up the crisis,"" he said.Ahead of the Winter Olympic Games, China authorities vowed to prepare for any emergencies and further prevent the threat of terrorism from emerging or impacting the Games.The Winter Olympic Games is held amid multiple and complicated big-power politics and many contingencies may occur during the Games, mostly stirred up by the US, Lü Xiang, a research fellow at the China Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times on Friday. On external risks, Lü said the US may use geopolitical conflict to dilute Olympic unity and fan the flames of a potential Russia-Ukraine conflict. Similarly, the US may also make trouble in the China Sea and the Taiwan Straits, and even ally with partners such as Japan to display military power, he said. ""The US has a team that focuses on hyping Xinjiang-related issue. It may repeat its old tricks of inviting some so-called victims of human rights to smear China's human rights. On China Sea, it may deploy some military aircrafts for reconnaissance missions,"" Lü said.As for the Games itself, the US has spared no efforts to attack China's COVID-19 policy and closed loop management system, some experts said.",CHINA,DIPLOMACY,The three Olympic Villages in Beijing.

93,"If US provokes China or Russia, the other won’t be indifferent",Hu Xijin,2022-01-28,"China State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi on January 27 had a phone conversation with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken at the latter's request. Judging from the briefings from both sides and various comments, Wang overwhelmed Antony Blinken. The initial statement released by the US did not mention so-called ""human rights,"" Hong Kong or Xinjiang, while the statement issued by China showed that Wang criticized the US for still sticking with erroneous words and deeds related to China and demanded that the US should stop interfering in the Winter Olympic Games, stop playing with fire on the Taiwan question, and stop creating various anti-China ""small cliques.""The Ukraine crisis appeared to be the focus of the conversation. Wang called on all parties to remain calm and pointed out that Russia's legitimate security concerns should be taken seriously and addressed. This sentence has been widely quoted by US and West media, as if a rare nerve was touched. They believe it's a symbol of ""deepening relations"" between China and Russia. But doesn't Russia have legitimate security concerns in East EU? As far as I'm concerned, the Ukraine crisis contains two aspects: first, Russia-Ukraine dispute; second, a serious confrontation among all relevant parties caused by the US and NATO's strategic suppression of Russia. The eastward expansion of NATO is so unnerving to Russia, almost pushing Moscow into a corner. Russia demanded that NATO, which is hostile to Moscow, not absorb former Soviet republic Ukraine and not deploy troops on Russia's border. The request is within reason. The US is strategically squeezing China and Russia at the same time. It's arrogant. It is pushing China and Russia together to strike back. Russia has suffered more pressure from the US. How it will resolve disputes with Ukraine is one thing. But when it comes to resisting a US crackdown, Russia is not alone. Most of the China people will support it and are willing to see the China government assist Russia in this aspect. Because we know well that if Russia is crushed by the US, this will bring no good to China at all. China and Russia have a comprehensive strategic partnership of coordination. They are not empty words. Given a ""back-to-back"" relationship between China and Russia, the US cannot do anything with the two great powers. That Russia and China are ""not allies, but better than allies"" has become an official statement. Let US carefully mull over the connotation of this expression. If it provokes either China or Russia, the other one will not be indifferent. US should expect this in the future.  The author is a commentator with the Global Times. opinion@globaltimes.com.cn",OPINION,VIEWPOINT,"The national flags of China and Russia are seen on Red Square, Moscow.

95,Oil prices hit multi-year highs amid geopolitical tensions,Agencies,2022-01-27," Oil prices climbed to their multi-year highs on Wednesday as concerns over geopolitical tensions persist. The West Texas Intermediate (WTI) for March delivery added 1.75 US dollars, or 2 percent, to settle at 87.35 dollars a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Brent crude for March delivery increased 1.76 dollars, or 2 percent, to close at 89.96 dollars a barrel on the London ICE Futures Exchange. Earlier in the session, the global oil benchmark topped 90 dollars a barrel for the first time in eight years. Both crude benchmarks settled at their highest prices since October 2014. The rally followed an upbeat session that saw WTI and Brent jumped 2.75 percent and 2.24 percent, respectively, on Tuesday. ""It is primarily because of the Ukraine conflict that we are still seeing no more pronounced or lasting price correction,"" Carsten Fritsch, energy analyst at Commerzbank Research, said Wednesday in a note. ""If oil shipments from Russia were to be disrupted as a result, oil prices of well over 100 US dollars could be expected, at least in the short term,"" he said. Traders also sifted through a weekly US fuel inventory report. The US Energy Information Administration (EIA) on Wednesday said the nation's crude oil inventories increased by 2.4 million barrels during the week ending Jan. 21.

96,The crisis around Ukraine: Is there a chance for a peaceful settlement?,Sergey Biryukov,2022-01-27,"The escalation of the crisis situation around Ukraine has been gaining momentum in recent days. According to news agencies, the US is ready to transfer up to 8,500 military personnel to EU in a short time if necessary, as the Pentagon said before. NATO on Monday announced the transfer of ships and aircraft to EU: Bulgaria, Romania and Lithuania. Spain, the Netherlands, and Denmark have announced their readiness to send additional forces to EU. On Monday morning, it became known that the US, and then the United Kingdom, Australia and Germany began to evacuate some diplomats from Ukraine, as well as their family members. This was explained by the ""growing threat from Russia."" The Japan government is also studying the possibility of evacuating its citizens, including embassy staff. Donbass has become noticeably more complicated again. Eduard Basurin, deputy head of the People's Militia Department of the self-proclaimed Donetsk, said that the Ukraine army on the line of confrontation in Donbass is preparing for an offensive. At the same time, EU and US officials told The US Post about ""unusual movements of equipment and military personnel in the West regions of Russia."" The Kremlin said that the movement of Russia troops on the territory of the country is exclusively a matter of Russia. Presidential press secretary Dmitry Peskov stated that ""Ukraine is most likely seeking another attempt to start a forceful solution to its own problem"" and that ""those who brought their armed forces from overseas are talking about unusual military activity.""The aggravation in relations between Russia and the West, however, did not stop the negotiation process between the two sides. Russia is negotiating with the US and NATO on security guarantees. Among the main issues discussed is the settlement of the situation around Ukraine. Negotiations are held at different levels both in person and over the phone. The current situation around Ukraine is a consequence of a complex positional game being played by the West which Russia was forced to join, forming its own response to emerging external challenges. The West often reproaches Russia with geopolitical revisionism - but at the same time does not explain its reasoning. For example, when did such ""revisionism"" begin - from 2014, two decades earlier, after the collapse of the USSR? NATO, despite Moscow's repeated appeals, refuses to discuss security guarantees for Moscow with Russia - which creates a tense and suspended situation that threatens to further aggravate the confrontation. NATO functionaries periodically make political statements that preserve a very tense situation - that is, they continue a set of impromptu actions that cannot be considered a manifestation of a reasonable policy. In turn, Ukraine, represented by its political leaders, manifests itself as a state that has lost a considerable part of its political subjectivity as a result of the crises it has experienced, and, due to the unilateral bet on the West, is unable to conduct balanced and non-confrontational politics.The thesis about Russia's impending attack on Ukraine is a political and propaganda construct of the West, which is actively supported by the Ukraine authorities in order to demonstrate their loyalty to West countries. Russia is not interested in conducting military operations in Ukraine territory or engaging in a direct military confrontation with West countries, but cannot allow a humanitarian catastrophe on the territory of Donbass, which will inevitably arise as a result of the intensification of military activity of the Ukraine armed forces (with the military-technical support of NATO countries) against the two unrecognized republics. Russia is fundamentally ready to negotiate with the West on the principles of interaction and de-escalation of the situation around Ukraine - but it cannot deviate from the fundamental requirements, including the rejection of NATO expansion in the post-Soviet space, the preservation of the neutral status of Ukraine and Georgia, and the inadmissibility of the military presence of the North Atlantic Bloc countries on the territory of these states. The question is the readiness of West countries and NATO to agree.At the same time, Russia has demonstrated that in response to unilateral actions and decisions of West countries, it is ready to act quite harshly - but this rigidity will be strictly proportional to the actions of the opposite side. The current crisis around Ukraine and Donbass has once again shown how fragile the world has become in a situation of weakening mutual trust between states and the progressive weakening of international institutions. At the same time, the position of the leadership of a number of EU countries, as well as the rejection of a confrontational style in foreign policy by representatives of a large number of states, among which China stands out, allows US to maintain hope for a prosperous and peaceful settlement of the current situation.The author is a professor at the Siberian Institute of Management in Novosibirsk of Russia. opinion@globaltimes.com.cn",OPINION,VIEWPOINT,"US Secretary of State Antony Blinken (L) and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov shake hands before their meeting on January 21, 2022, in Geneva, Switzerland.

97,"Wang Yi urges US to stop interrupting Beijing Games, respect Russia's concerns over Ukraine in phone call with Blinken",Yang Sheng,2022-01-27,"China State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi on Thursday urged the US to stop interfering in the Winter Olympic Games and stop playing with fire on the Taiwan question while calling on all parties involved in Ukraine to remain calm and not instigate tensions in a phone call with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken.  The China foreign minister also stressed that ""pressure will only make the China people more united, and confrontation will not stop China from becoming stronger,"" and he also said Russia's ""legitimate security concerns"" over the Ukraine issue should be taken seriously and addressed.China experts said that the US now desperately needs communication with China due to the close ties and high-level mutual trust between China and Russia, and the matter of unfair and illegitimate US tariffs over China goods is another hot issue. However, China wants to talk to the US as it has found that US failed to implement Joe Biden's positive message for fixing China-US ties from China-US virtual summit in November, and wants to reaffirm China's red lines on relevant issues. At the request of the US, Wang had a phone call with Antony Blinken on Thursday to discuss bilateral relations and the Ukraine crisis, according to a news release by the China Foreign Ministry.Wang warned during the conversation that the US should implement the positive response made by US President Joe Biden in the previous China-US virtual summit in November, and stop interrupting the Beijing Winter Olympic Games and stop playing with fire on the Taiwan question and creating various anti-China ""cliques."" The US State Department is considering allowing its embassy and consulates to authorize the departure of their employees in China, citing ""China's epidemic situation"" ahead of Winter Olympic Games, a source familiar with the matter told the Global Times late Tuesday night. China experts believed the ill-intentioned tactics expose only the true intention of US in sabotaging the Winter Olympic Games and its inconsistent China policy. Wang said mutual respect, peaceful coexistence and win-win cooperation are the three principles for developing China-US relations in the new era, as China President Xi Jinping brought up in the virtual meeting in November with US President Joe Biden. The remarks also received a positive response from Joe Biden. ""However, what the world has seen is that there has been no substantive change in the tone in US policy toward China and President Joe Biden's stated position has not been fully implemented. The US side is still sticking with erroneous words and deeds related to China,"" he stressed.Lü Xiang, a research fellow at the China Academy of Social Sciences, said that the Joe Biden administration is unlikely to change the duplicity of its diplomacy as it is getting more and more frustrated in dealing with China as it has tried almost everything, but achieved no significant goal in containing China.Experts said the US' recent acts in interrupting the Winter Olympic Games and continuing military acts in the China Sea and Taiwan Straits, as well as its reluctance in fixing trade ties, just prove the Joe Biden administration has very low credibility as its words and acts are mostly contradictory, and China holds no illusion that the US will fully keep its promises.""But the timing of the Wang-Antony Blinken phone conversation is important, and it's probably signaling that the top leaders of the two countries are likely to have another talk ahead of or amid the China Lunar New Year,"" Li Haidong, a professor at the Institute of International Relations of the China Foreign Affairs University, told the Global Times on Thursday. Although the China-US tension is far from over, the two countries all have significant political agendas in 2022 - the 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China and midterm elections in the US, so normally at these times, the positive parts of US policy toward China will see trouble, while confrontation will be largely promoted, Li said. ""So the direct conversation between the top diplomats of the two countries at the beginning of 2022 also aims to prevent potential miscalculations and new escalations of existing tension,"" Li said.Diao Daming, an associate professor at the Renmin University of China in Beijing, told the Global Times that the world also expects China and the US to keep communicating, and this call is sending a signal to the international community that the channel for communication is still working.Antony Blinken said that it is important for the foreign ministers of the two countries to have regular communication, stressing that there is no change in President Joe Biden's stated position during the meeting between the two heads of state. The US and China have both overlapping interests and differences, and the US is ready to manage and control the differences in a responsible manner, Antony Blinken said. The US one-China policy remains unchanged, Antony Blinken said, noting that the US will cheer for its athletes participating in the Winter Olympic Games, and wishes the China people a happy Spring Festival.Antony Blinken also briefed Wang Yi on the US position on the Ukraine issue, among others. Wang said to solve the Ukraine issue, it is still necessary to return to the new Minsk agreement. The new Minsk agreement, endorsed by the UN, is a basic political document recognized by all parties and should be implemented earnestly. China will support any effort that conforms to the direction and spirit of this agreement, Wang noted. ""The reason why the Ukraine situation has become intense again is that the US is trying to violate the new Minsk agreement as it's supplying weapons to Ukraine and trying to deploy more weapons in the region, and even seeking an expansion of NATO, so these will surely cause a reaction from Russia,"" said Yang Jin, an associate research fellow at the Institute of Russia, EU and Central Asia Studies at the China Academy of Social Sciences.Wang said ""At the same time, we call on all parties to remain calm and refrain from inflaming tensions or hyping up the crisis. The security of one country should not be at the expense of the security of others, and regional security should not be guaranteed by strengthening or even expanding military blocs."" Today in the 21st century, all parties should completely abandon a Cold War mentality, and form a balanced, effective and sustainable EU security mechanism through negotiations, with Russia's legitimate security concerns being taken seriously and addressed.Yang said we hope the situation in Georgia during the Beijing Olympics 2008 will not happen again. ""At that time, the then Georgian government believed it had support from the US to provoke Russia and then received Russia's counter-attack."" Today, the US is withdrawing its diplomats from Ukraine and providing weapons to Kiev which is irresponsible and a dangerous sign of war, he said.",CHINA,DIPLOMACY,Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi.

98,"US' mudslinging toward Russia, China a sign of its own decline",Mu Lu,2022-01-27,"While the existing global order is scarred and the US is incapable of sustaining it and it doesn't think about any reforming move, what should the US-led West do? Some West elites have given their answer: Shifting the problem to the countries they do not like - China and Russia.A recent article in the Financial Times has taken advantage of the Russia-US tensions over Ukraine and laboriously included the Taiwan question, pointing the gun at Russia and China. The article titled ""Russia and China's plans for a new world order"" unsurprisingly portrayed Russia and China as the ""villains"", suggesting that the two countries' ideas go against so-called universal values. The article read, ""While the West liberal tradition promotes the idea of universal human rights, Russia and China thinkers make the argument that different cultural traditions and 'civilizations' should be allowed to develop in different ways.""Lü Xiang, a research fellow at the China Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times that the Financial Times fundamentally represents the viewpoint of the elites of the US and the UK, whose ultimate goal is to overthrow Russia and China. They bring together totally irrelevant matters to create a narrative favorable for them.The entanglement between Ukrainians and Russia dates back to Tsarist Russia, and, the Taiwan question is purely an internal matter of China stemming from the country's own history. If there is any similarity between the Ukraine tension and the Taiwan question, it is that they both have nothing to do with the world order. ""The Financial Times article links Ukraine and the island of Taiwan to world order in a far-fetched way because those West elites see China and Russia as a thorn in their eyes: They cannot deal with the two countries at will as they do to others, so they start to smear them as destroying the world order,"" Lü said. ""On the contrary, the ever closer relationship and bond between China and Russia is the last defense that protects the world order.""The Financial Times article's far-fetched argument is naturally contradicting itself. For example, it says the crisis over Ukraine is a struggle over the future of the world order, because, ""For the US, these [Russia's] demands violate some basic principles of the current world order - in particular, the right of an independent country to define its own foreign policy and strategic choices.""Isn't China and Russia's idea that different civilizations should be allowed to develop in different ways the practice of an independent country's right to define its own policy and strategic choices? Isn't the suppression of China and Russia's development a violation of those basic principles, according to the Financial Times?Maybe this is the problem with the US-led old global order: The US-led West defines the world by its own standards, and then domineers and refuses to allow any move to seek common ground while reserving differences.Threat from the USThe US' rise on the world stage was also a process of building an order globally. It has played the roles of both a hegemonic controller and a builder of the order. The liberal world order established after World War II has synergized with US hegemony to form a system at the service of the US. But now, the US has gradually lost the strength to support that system, especially under former President Donald Trump's presidency. The US started to exhibit many symptoms of a failure to adapt to the liberal international order and US has tried to get out of its own box by placing the blame on China and Russia. However, more people have begun to realize that much of the damage to the world order is the job of the US.Lü pointed out that the US is the biggest threat to the order it has built itself. For example, the world order principles are rarely taken into account when the US deals with the countries to its south.""The US has a lot to be ashamed of in relations with its neighbors. Think about what it has done to Grenada. The international community blamed the US for that, but so what?"" Lü noted. ""And think Panama. The US instigated the independence of Panama just for the control of the Canal. And decades later, the US sent troops to Panama to take the country's president into US' prison who US didn't like.""Nevertheless, the US can no longer easily deceive people by propagating its so-called universal values. More people see the real political intention behind those values - because the universal values are not even universal within the US. Problems such as racial discrimination, labor-management confrontation, money politics, the gap between the rich and the poor, social fragmentation and insecure human rights have long existed and become increasingly serious in the US and some other West countries. This stands in sharp contrast to the universal values they claim to uphold. The world order based on such values has long since fallen into disarray.Some West scholars didn't avoid admitting to this reality. As early as 2017, the Munich Security Report said frankly that the world is ""on the brink of a post-West age"" as ""Some of the most fundamental pillars of the West and of the liberal international order are weakening.""Shada Islam, director of EU and geopolitics at Friends of EU, a renowned and influential independent think tank based in Brussels, recently told the People's Daily in an interview that the threat to West liberal democracy came from outside but now the biggest risk comes from within the West society.Reluctant to let go of hegemonyFive years have passed since the Munich Security Report 2017 was released, but the problems faced with the US-led West didn't lessen. However, their brazen approach to handling the problem is unmatched. They have come up with a self-deceiving ideological propaganda campaign of ""democracy versus autocracy"" in an attempt to distract people's attention. But such outdated tricks cannot hide the fact that the US' strength is waning, rapidly.Those West elites ignore the fact that reforming the world order is not just a demand of China, but appeal to most countries in the system. Just as Professor Zheng Yongnian once said, ""It is clear that in the system, the interests of some West countries have been over-expressed, while the interests of developing countries, including China, have been far from fully expressed. This unbalanced power structure is the cause why the international system does not work well. One could therefore argue that reform is more than a requirement.""As more countries now become dissatisfied with the US and its hegemony, the world order will eventually go along the direction of reforms. The world longs for a world order that is more democratic with more consultations where more international organizations democratically participate so that different countries can play a more important role in the order. Lü believes that with China and Russia as the defense, the world should go on this path in the future - and the US and some of its pawns will try to erect barriers to impede urgently needed reforms. ""Despite that many West countries are upset at the US, some of them fear the US may decline too fast and impacting their interests,"" Lü said.A truly democratic international order must be one in which most global problems are resolved through consultation among the countries involved. ""Take the pandemic that has lasted for two years. If there had been a global coordination mechanism from the beginning, the pandemic would not had been what it is today,"" Lü noted.The author is a reporter with the Global Times. opinion@globaltimes.com.cn",OPINION,VIEWPOINT,Illustration: Chen Xia/Global Times,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'US': ('LOC', 5), 'China': ('LOC', 10), 'Russia': ('LOC', 13), 'Ukraine': ('LOC', 4), 'Taiwan': ('LOC', 4), 'UK': ('LOC', 1), 'West': ('MISC', 4), 'Ukrainian': ('MISC', 1), 'Tsar': ('MISC', 1), 'Financial Times': ('ORG', 4), 'China Academy of Social Sciences': ('ORG', 1), 'Global Times': ('ORG', 1), 'L': ('ORG', 1), 'Lü Xiang': ('PER', 1)}"
99,An investigation describes Downing Street parties during lockdowns,Reuters,2022-01-27," UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Wednesday rejected opposition calls to resign for attending lockdown parties but accepted that a rule that ministers should lose their jobs if they had knowlingly misled parliament applied to him.Boris Johnson, who in 2019 won the biggest Conservative majority in more than 30 years, is braced for the publication of an official investigation into claims that there were multiple boozy Downing Street parties during lockdowns. He told parliament no rules were broken.It was not immediately clear when the results of that investigation by Cabinet Office official Sue Gray would be published, especially as police have opened their own investigation.Asked by the opposition Labour Party Keir Starmer leader if the ministerial code, which says that ministers who had knowingly misled parliament should offer to resign, applied to him Boris Johnson said: ""Of course.""""If he'd misled parliament, he must resign,"" Starmer told parliament. ""Will you now resign?""""No,"" Boris Johnson replied.He said he could not speak about investigations into the alleged parties. Boris Johnson said his government was focused on driving economic growth and leading the West response to the Ukraine crisis. Boris Johnson has given a variety of explanations about the parties: first he said no rules had been broken but then he apologized to the UK people for the apparent hypocrisy of such gatherings. He has denied an allegation he was warned that a ""bring your own booze"" lockdown gathering on May 20, 2020, which he says he thought was a work event, was inappropriate.ITV reported on Monday that Boris Johnson and his now wife Carrie had attended a surprise party of up to 30 people for his birthday in the Cabinet Room at Downing Street in June 2020, when indoor gatherings were banned.UK police on Tuesday said they had opened their own investigation into lockdown events at Downing Street, upping the pressure on Boris Johnson.Some of his lawmakers have already demanded he resign but to trigger a leadership challenge, 54 of the 359 Conservative MPs in parliament must write letters of no confidence to the chairman of the party's 1922 Committee.The number of letters submitted is kept secret until the threshold of 54 is reached.UK Foreign Secretary Elizabeth Truss, tipped as a possible future prime minister if Boris Johnson is toppled, said Downing Street had not yet been given the findings of the Gray report but that it would come out very soon.Asked about the claims that Boris Johnson and his staff had partied at the heart of the UK state while ordinary people were banned from even bidding farewell to their dying relatives in person, Elizabeth Truss said some of the reports were concerning. ""There clearly needs to be a change in culture,"" Elizabeth Truss told the BBC. ""We need to get the results of the report, we need to look at the results and fix the issues there are.""Asked if she had leadership ambitions, Elizabeth Truss said Boris Johnson, 57, had done a great job as prime minister by delivering Brexit and responding to COVID-19 pandemic. Elizabeth Truss said she was 100 percent supportive of Boris Johnson.",WORLD,EUROPE,"British Prime Minister Boris Johnson speaks at a COVID-19 press conference in the Downing Street media briefing room in London, Britain, Dec. 15, 2021.

100,"Kremlin Says Moscow, Havana Have 'Synchronised Positions' Amid Speculation on Russian Bases in Cuba",Sputnik News,2022-01-26,"  Russia President Vladimir Putin and his Cuban counterpart President Miguel Diaz-Canel spoke by phone on Monday to discuss ""issues of further coordination of the actions of the two countries in the international arena,"" according to a Kremlin statement. The talks came in an atmosphere of growing tensions between Russia and NATO over Ukraine.Vladimir Putin and Miguel Diaz-Canel 'synchronised their positions' on international issues during their talks Monday, but did not discuss the possibility of Russia military bases in Cuba, Kremlin spokesman Dmitri Peskov has said.""You know that relations between Russia and Cuba have deep traditions...and indeed, the synchronisation of positions on international and regional issues of mutual interest to both countries is extremely important. This is what the leaders of the two countries spoke about yesterday,"" Peskov said, speaking to reporters on Tuesday.When asked about whether talks between Vladimir Putin and Diaz-Canel on Russia-Cuban ""coordination...in the international arena"" included possible increased military-technical cooperation or the deployment of Russia military bases on the Caribbean island, Peskov answered bluntly ""No.""The Russia and Cuban presidents spoke by phone on Monday, with a Kremlin press release indicating that the talks included a ""thorough exchange of views on the subject of bilateral trade, economic and investment cooperation."" The two sides ""also discussed issues of further coordination of the actions of the two countries in the international arena in accordance with the principles of strategic partnership and the traditions of friendship and mutual understanding."" Finally, ""the intention to work closely together to strengthen bilateral relations was agreed, and it was resolved to intensify contacts at various levels,"" according to the Kremlin.Monday's talks followed speculation by US media that Moscow may seek to deploy military capabilities in the West Hemisphere near the US in response to NATO's troop and missile deployments and continued expansion toward Russia's borders in EU.Last week, US Ambassador to the UN Linda Thomas-Greenfield warned Moscow that Russia ""aggressive action"" in the form of missile deployments in Latin US would be met with a ""strong response"" from US. She did not elaborate on what this ""strong response"" might be.Earlier, the Kremlin and the Russia Foreign Ministry each hinted that Russia would 'explore options' and 'not rule anything out' when it comes to ensuring security and strategic stability, including the possible deployment of some type of military infrastructure in Latin US.Last month, a few days before the publication of a pair of Russia security proposals aimed at significantly easing tensions between Moscow on one side and US and the NATO alliance on the other, Russia Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov indicated that Russia was looking to avoid the repeat of a Cuban Missile Crisis-style scenario, including ""the non-deployment of these kinds of weapons near our borders, the withdrawal of forces and assets which destabilise the situation, [and] a rejection of provocative measures, including various drills"".Russia-Cuba TiesNotwithstanding the dramatic weakening of relations between Moscow and Havana following the collapse of the Soviet Union thirty years ago, Cuba remains one of Russia's main partners in the West Hemisphere, with the countries enjoying friendly diplomatic ties and expressing solidarity for one another in international forums, and marking growing economic, investment, scientific, cultural and humanitarian cooperation and engagement from the 2000s on.At the same time, the two countries have been careful when it comes to reengaging militarily, with Russia pulling out the estimated 11,000 Soviet troops stationed in the country in the early 1990s, and closing down the Lourdes Signals Intelligence facility - which enabled Soviet and Russia intelligence to monitor an array of commercial and government communications throughout the southeastern US, in 2002.In 1962, concerned by the deployment of US nuclear missiles in Turkey and the global strategic imbalance caused by the lack of Soviet intercontinental ballistic missiles capable of reaching the US, Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev attempted to secretly deploy over 160 nuclear weapons in Cuba. US intelligence found out about the attempted deployment in October 1962, sparking a two week diplomatic and military standoff which nearly led to World War III.The crisis was resolved after Moscow agreed to withdraw the missiles from Cuba in exchange for guarantees from US not to invade the island, and a quiet pledge by the US to withdraw its Jupiter missiles from Turkey.In recent years, Russia has again expressed concerns about the deployment of dual-use US missile defence infrastructure in Romania and Poland with offensive capabilities, and about attempts by NATO to pull Ukraine into the West alliance. Last month, President Vladimir Putin warned that alliance missiles deployed in Ukraine would have a flight time to Moscow of just 4-5 minutes.",WORLD,EUROPE,"Photo taken on June 3, 2019 shows the Kremlin Palace (L) and the Saint Basil's Cathedral in Moscow, capital of Russia.Photo: Xinhua",Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'Russia': ('LOC', 11), 'Kremlin': ('LOC', 4), 'Ukraine': ('LOC', 1), 'Cuba': ('LOC', 2), 'Caribbean': ('LOC', 1), 'Moscow': ('LOC', 2), 'West Hemisphere': ('LOC', 1), 'Klin': ('LOC', 1), 'Latin US': ('LOC', 6), 'Vladimir Putin': ('PER', 3), 'Miguel Diaz - Canel': ('PER', 2), 'Dmitri Peskov': ('PER', 3), 'Diaz - Canel': ('PER', 1), 'Thomas': ('PER', 1), 'Cuban': ('MISC', 3), 'Latin': ('MISC', 1), 'NATO': ('ORG', 2), 'EU': ('ORG', 1), 'UN': ('ORG', 1), 'Ministry': ('ORG', 1)}"
101,German navy chief resigning over controversial remarks ‘has only himself to blame’: Chinese FM,Global Times,2022-01-25," In response to the recent anti-China rhetoric made by Germany navy chief Kay-Achim Schonbach that led to his resignation, China Foreign Ministry said that it is noticed he was forced to resign and that he has only himself to blame. During his visit to India recently, Schonbach said he is ""a very radical Roman Catholic,"" and said China acts as an enemy to many countries, according to media reports. However, Schonbach stepped down after he said that Vladimir Putin ""probably"" deserved respect, and that Crimea was ""gone"" and would ""never come back"" to Ukraine. He also argued in favor of cooperating with Russia to contain China's rise. ""Those remarks are typical of a religious extremist,"" Zhao Lijian, spokesperson of the China Foreign Ministry, told a routine press conference on Tuesday, noting that Schonbach's words are against the peace and trend of the times. Openly provoking to divide the camps and inciting hatred and hostility is not only ridiculous but also extremely dangerous, which the international community should unanimously condemne, Zhao said.""I noticed that he had been forced to resign, and he had done it himself,"" he said. Some media reports described Schonbach's comments as an unprecedented diplomatic incident, and the Germany government distanced itself from the comments, according to Germany media outlet Deutsche Welle.China and Germany are all-round strategic partners, Zhao said. Since the establishment of the new Germany government, the leaders of China and Germany closely interacted and agreed that they should continue promoting bilateral relations from a strategic perspective and actively expand practical cooperation between the two countries with a pragmatic attitude, Zhao noted.""The two sides have agreed to take the celebration of the 50th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations in 2022 as an opportunity to increase communication and cooperation, expand mutual benefit and win-win results, work together to tackle challenges and make due contributions to global governance,"" he said. Global Times",CHINA,DIPLOMACY,Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian Photo: fmprc.gov.cn,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'China': ('LOC', 7), 'Germany': ('LOC', 6), 'India': ('LOC', 1), 'Crimea': ('LOC', 1), 'Ukraine': ('LOC', 1), 'Russia': ('LOC', 1), 'Kay - Achim Schonbach': ('PER', 5), 'Vladimir Putin': ('PER', 1), 'Zhao Lijian': ('PER', 4), 'Foreign Ministry': ('ORG', 2), 'Deutsche Welle': ('ORG', 1), 'Roman Catholic': ('MISC', 1)}"

103,Moscow sends 500-member delegation to Beijing 2022: Russian envoy,Hu Yuwei,2022-01-25,"Sending a large delegation of over 500 members to the Winter Olympic Games and opposing a political boycott represents the latest Russia support to China, apart from maintaining the solidarity with China in core sovereign and security interests. Russia and China have seen a qualitative leap in relations in the past year and will step up cooperation in vaccines, aerospace projects, energy, and natural gas, but not a military alliance, the Russia ambassador to China said on Tuesday.Amid escalating global tensions which have directly affected China and Russia, both countries should not be blamed as they have made joint efforts to overcome difficulties, safeguard global peace and stability and help avoid the situation spiraling out of control, Ambassador Andrey Denisov stressed at a Tuesday press conference.Russia plans to send a 500-member delegation, including 216 athletes, as well as coaches, medical workers and service support staff, the biggest foreign delegation to the event.Denisov said that the Olympics are a highly expected event and that he believes China can host the event with high quality, and overcome the difficulties posed by COVID-19.Denisov denounced the so-called ""political boycott"" of the Games, saying people want to sabotage the event for narrow political interests, which damages their own interests. Such efforts are futile as people know that they have no valid basis, and the slanders will fade away, he noted.Russia President Vladimir Putin, at the invitation of China's President Xi Jinping, will visit Beijing on February 4, on the opening day of the Winter Olympic Games, and talks at the highest level will be held the same day, TASS reported.""We are standing together [with China] against the politicization of sports and demonstrative boycotts,"" Vladimir Putin said at a meeting with athletes of the Russia national Olympic team on Tuesday. ""We are supporting traditional Olympic values, first of all, equality and justice.""Vladimir Putin will be among the first group of state leaders to visit China since COVID-19 pandemic.  ""We very much expect Vladimir Putin's visit to China to bring new hope for the resumption of normal exchanges between the two countries,"" Denisov told the Global Times on Tuesday.When asked if there is a prospect of a military alliance between China and Russia amid increasing global tensions, the ambassador said the two countries have kept close cooperation in all areas and maintained communication in sensitive areas, so there are no plans for a military alliance in the foreseeable future.Russia always supports multilateral diplomatic channels in promoting world peace and stability, said the ambassador. ""The practice of forming narrow military alliances by certain countries is outdated. For instance, the UK, US and Australia formed the AUKUS and it is clear to US who the alliance is targeting. We don't wish to repeat, and we don't see any incentive in a military alliance.""The Russia ambassador said there are no taboo topics in bilateral relations, even on sensitive security issues such as the Ukraine issue, the China Sea disputes and Taiwan question. Affairs involving Ukraine and Taiwan are two very different issues, with very different contexts, which China and Russia have made their position clear to each other, the ambassador said. We also believe that intervention by external forces is the main reason driving the recent escalation in tensions across the Taiwan Straits, said the ambassador. The international situation is becoming complicated, as seen in Russia's deteriorating ties with the US and the EU, and China's relations with the US and EU also face many difficulties. However, China and Russia have never been rule breakers and trouble makers, he stressed. ""Russia's relations with the US and EU will not affect China-Russia relations.""US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and his Russia counterpart Sergey Lavrov met on Friday in Geneva on the Ukraine crisis. Russia Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov, who led Russia's delegation in a meeting with the US, told Russia television he could neither confirm nor exclude sending military assets to Cuba and Venezuela if talks fail. Asked about these steps, he said ""it all depends on the actions by our US counterparts,"" the Guardian reported.""Do we fear a repeat of the Cuban missile crisis? We are not afraid of anyone, including the US. But I believe the missile crisis will not happen,"" the Russia ambassador said in response to growing tensions in Ukraine.Under the strategic security consultation mechanism between the two countries, Russia has regularly updated the results of their talks with the West on issues such as Ukraine with China. And Russia has expressed specific concerns to the US and NATO, and is waiting for written responses from them, the ambassador revealed.The Russia ambassador said he looks forward to more non-virtual people-to-people and cultural exchanges between China and Russia in the near future, especially in the China-Russia years of sports exchanges in 2022 and 2023.China and Russia will sign a new space Cooperation Program for 2023-2027 this year, which will include a plan to create an open and inclusive International Lunar Research Station (ILRS) by 2035, said the ambassador.He also noted that there will be no political obstacles to scientific and technological cooperation between the two countries, especially on the R&D of COVID-19 vaccines. He expects the Russia COVID-19 vaccine Sputnik V to be registered in China soon. The ambassador, who received China vaccines, said he had no doubt about the quality of China vaccines.""President Vladimir Putin enjoys visiting China very much, but this time his schedule will be relatively simple due to pandemic risks,"" said the ambassador.

105,Europe lacks leverage amid rising tensions surrounding Ukraine,Wang Shuo,2022-01-24,"This past weekend, many people in the US and EU were nervous about the possibility of the ""first war of 2022"" breaking out on the Russia-Ukraine border. To make things worse, the US Department of State issued a travel warning to US, and, the US and some EU countries started to supply weaponry to Ukraine. Also, the USS Harry S. Truman aircraft carrier strike group has planned to lead a large-scale NATO naval exercise in the Mediterranean Sea, beginning January 24.There remain differences between the US and EU on how to resolve the current Russia-Ukraine crisis. US President Joe Biden publicly admitted at a press conference on the first anniversary of his administration that there are differences within NATO on how to respond to Russia's ""minor incursion."" Joe Biden's statement was hotly debated, for it is not only deeply hurting Ukraine, but also exposing the rift within NATO, especially between the US and its EU allies. The Joe Biden administration, failing largely in domestic affairs, wanted to use its ""success"" in bridging the transatlantic alliance as a highlight of its political achievements, but it ended up being botched.Admittedly, most EU countries are highly dependent on the US-led NATO to provide security, which is unlikely to change fundamentally in the foreseeable future. As a result, EU follows or submits to the US in many ways, whether it wants to or not.EU is counting on the US to take the lead in solving any security problems it faces. Therefore, EU is happy to see Joe Biden coming into power after the 2020 US elections. After all, the four years during the Donald Trump administration was a torment for EU. A derailed US, in any case, will be difficult to be trusted by EU. When Joe Biden said ""US is back,"" some Europeans, the pro-US factions, in particular, felt glad and the transatlantic relations seemed to have warmed up for a while. However, the Europeans have always been a bit on edge as nobody knows whether the Joe Biden administration will become a ""lame duck"" after the midterm elections, or whether Donald Trump will stage a comeback. Although the US and EU share common interests, fundamental differences still exist in their strategic goals. The US' hasty troop withdrawal from Afghanistan last year and its betrayal of EU by forming an AUKUS security pact with the UK and Australia are still fresh in EU's memory. The US wants to push EU to the forefront to contain Russia so that it can shift its attention and energy to the Asia-Pacific. However, despite contradictions with Russia, EU, in general, doesn't want to have direct confrontations with Russia, nor is it willing to become a victim of competition of major global powers. The Ukraine crisis, which is increasingly becoming a hot potato, is at the doorstep of EU. The Europeans have reason to be anxious, but they don't have a say. This can be observed from the order of three security dialogues with Russia held this month. The first was between the US and Russia, the second between NATO and Russia, and the last between the Organization for Security and Cooperation in EU and Russia. It seems EU is in a bit awkward position.It is imperative for EU to seek strategic autonomy, however, it is quite difficult to achieve. It is questionable whether the US will allow EU to gain autonomy at the critical moment, or to what extent EU's strategic autonomy is allowed. After all, EU has always been treated as a chess piece.Of course, the biggest problem stems from within EU. Members of the EU take different attitudes toward the Ukraine crisis. How can EU's autonomy be realized if EU countries cannot even reach a consensus among themselves?Judging from the current situation, EU will continue to face a dilemma. And if the situation in Ukraine deteriorates, EU will be the first one affected. Thus, the Europeans must take the initiative. A source told Reuters on Saturday that political advisors from Russia, Ukraine, France, and Germany will hold ""Normandy format"" talks in Paris on Tuesday. If the ""Normandy format"" can be restarted successfully, the sense of anxiety and internal strife in EU could be eased. But in the long run, Europeans must hold the key to the problem in their own hands. The author is a professor at the School of International Relations at the Beijing Foreign Studies University. opinion@globaltimes.com.cn",OPINION,VIEWPOINT,"A Ukrainian serviceman patrols along a position at the front line with the eastern rebels not far from Avdiivka, Donetsk region, Ukraine.

 With the US and UK ordering families of embassy employees in Kiev to depart Ukraine and authorizing non-emergency personnel to leave on Sunday, fears of war are mounting over Russia's alleged ""impending invasion"" of Ukraine. Disinformation about the Ukraine crisis widely circulating among some West media including Bloomberg could affect China-Russia mutual trust, and this reflects the ""ill intention"" of the West forces trying to instigate divergences between Beijing and Moscow, analysts said. On Monday, the China Foreign Ministry refuted a Bloomberg report which claimed that the China leader had allegedly ""asked Russia President Vladimir Putin not to invade Ukraine during the Beijing Winter Olympic Games."" ""The report was purely made out of thin air. It seeks not only to smear and drive a wedge in China-Russia relations, but also to deliberately disrupt and undermine the Winter Olympic Games. Such a despicable trick cannot fool the international community,"" Zhao Lijian, spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said at a routine press conference. The China Embassy in Russia also refuted the report, saying in a statement sent to Russia news agency TASS on Saturday that the news ""is a hoax and provocation."" The embassy noted that China's position on the Ukraine issue is consistent and clear.In addition to the Bloomberg disinformation aimed at disrupting China-Russia relations, Russia's foreign ministry Sunday rejected what it described as ""disinformation"" from UK, as the Agence France-Presse reported, after London accused Moscow of working to install a pro-Russia leader in Ukraine as tensions soar.Disinformation circulated by the UK government is yet another indication that it is the NATO members led by the Anglo-Saxon nations that are escalating tensions around Ukraine, the Russia foreign ministry said in a tweet.'Forced to react'The military standoff on the Ukraine border has reached a very dangerous point, Yang Jin, an associate research fellow at the Institute of Russia, EU and Central Asia Studies at the China Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times on Monday.""No one wants to escalate the crisis into a war, but conflicts could be sparked easily by accidents, and it's hard to fully prevent accidents in the intense stand-off,"" Yang noted.""China has always hoped that Russia and the US could solve the problem over Ukraine through dialogue, and this position will not change,"" Yang said.Even if some conflicts occur in the coming days, Russia is unlikely to be the one to initiate provocations, since Moscow has previously supported the UN-adopted Olympic Truce during the Beijing Winter Olympic Games, while some countries like the US, the UK and Australia refused to sign it, said experts. They stressed that the US and its followers are more likely to launch conflicts and Russia is more likely to be the one who is forced to react if the conflicts escalate, similar to what happened in Georgia during the Beijing Olympics 2008.While some West media outlets are trying to disrupt China-Russia ties, unity within the West, or between the US and EU members, is in trouble as the EU stance and actions are quite different from those of the US in recent days on the crisis. Experts said the deep-seated divisions inside EU are making it difficult for the EU to act as a mediator on the current tensions.EU foreign ministers met in Brussels on Monday calling for a ""de-escalation"" of the situation around Ukraine, and US Secretary of State Antony Blinken was scheduled to join the meeting via a video link after the US government had ordered families of US diplomats to leave Ukraine. The order came after some US media reported that Russia had deployed 100,000 troops and heavy weapons along the Ukraine border, sounding alarm bells over its perceived aims in Ukraine, but Moscow insisted that it has no such plans, according to media reports. EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said on Monday that the EU will not follow the US move to withdraw embassy personnel and families in Ukraine, but ""all members of the EU are united,"" and are showing unprecedented unity over the situation in Ukraine, the AP reported. Amid growing tensions, Ukraine's Defense Minister Oleksii Reznikov said his country had received a second consignment of weapons from the US as part of defense aid totaling $200 million, Reuters reported on Sunday, noting that the US government will continue supporting Ukraine amid concerns over the Russia buildup of military defenses on the border. Also, Antony Blinken appeared on CNN on Sunday rebuffing calls to immediately impose economic sanctions on Russia, saying that ""when it comes to sanctions, the purpose of those sanctions is to deter Russia aggression. And so if they're triggered now, you lose the deterrent effect."" Tensions between the US and Russia over Ukraine showed that both sides are imposing extreme pressure to test each other's bottom lines. The essence of the current Ukraine issue concerns ""security guarantees"" which both sides want to negotiate but have always failed to reach agreement on, Cui Heng, an assistant research fellow from the Center for Russia Studies of China Normal University, told the Global Times on Monday. EU 'not an iron plate'The lack of unity within the EU is also obvious on the Ukraine crisis, and the recent resignation of Germany navy chief Kay-Achim Schonbach for his ""pro-Russia"" comments exposed the deep-seated divergences within the West over regional security issues, China analysts noted. Schonbach stepped down after he told a think tank panel during his visit to India on Friday that Vladimir Putin ""probably"" deserved respect, and Crimea was ""gone"" and would ""never come back"" to Ukraine, arguing in favor of cooperating with Russia to contain China's rise. Some media reports described the comments as an unprecedented diplomatic incident, and the Germany government distanced itself from Schonbach's comments, according to Germany media outlet Deutsche Welle. On the issues of Ukraine, the traditional EU powers differ with the new members of the block which are usually not as big as the former. ""The latter do not want to make trade with Russia at the cost of any country as they worry their own country would also be sacrificed by the US and EU powers in the future, and this is why they keep pushing the US to take tougher tones,"" Cui noted.Position within EU on Russia is clearly at odds with that of the US, some experts said. ""EU is not an iron plate, some countries may have less prejudice against Russia, and the Germany commander may have no hostility toward the Russia regime,"" Yang said. As Russia and Germany enjoy special relationship in their history and their current cooperation extends to sectors such as energy, the attitude of the Germany navy chief also reflects the country's practical view on foreign relations, which would be beneficial to the development of the national economy and to the stability and security of EU, experts said. ""Many of the EU countries want peace with Russia, unlike the US,"" Yang said. ""Only the US wants chaos."" Yang also believed that the EU can't be the meditator on the issue as it has no longer dominance in its own security affairs, since the US has much say in security affairs of EU through NATO.",CHINA,DIPLOMACY,Picture description not found,"Reporter, Beijing","Chen Qingqing co-leads the Global Times China desk.

107,"Biden tests Japan’s loyalty at virtual summit, but ‘disagreements remain to be solved’",Wang Qi,2022-01-22,"
Amid regional tensions and domestic COVID-19 spikes, US President Joe Biden held a virtual meeting with Japan Prime Minister Fumio Kishida on Friday, during which they agreed to boost cooperation on pressing economic and security issues, including China's growing power, North Korea's alleged missile launches and Russia's aims in Ukraine.It was the first virtual summit between Joe Biden and Kishida since the Japan Prime Minister took office in October 2021. Experts believed that seeking ""common ground,"" or more specifically testing Tokyo's loyalty to US under the new Japan leader, weighs much more for the US than anything else.The meeting comes after US national security adviser Jake Sullivan and his Japan counterpart Akiba Takeo's meeting on Thursday, in which Sullivan discussed the important of the alliance, as well as approaches to most of the issues on Friday's summit. Citing a senior administration official, Bloomberg reported that Joe Biden wants to talk about ""a strong, united response that would result from further Russia aggression toward Ukraine,"" China's ""threats,"" as well as the recent ""weapon tests"" by North Korea. Citing Japan officials, Japan media Kyodo said the pair would also initiate a new ""2 plus 2"" dialogue that will cover economic and diplomatic issues. On January 7, the US and Japan held a virtual 2+2 meeting between foreign and defense ministers, with a new five-year agreement on sharing the cost of the US military presence in Japan, aiming to ""deepen defense cooperation.""Experts told the Global Times that newly elected Japan prime ministers usually pick the US as the first stop for a visit after they take office. Due to the current COVID-19 spike, the online meeting has become the only choice, which is also in line with Japan's diplomatic tradition.""The meeting is a kind of 'pilgrimage,' as Japan sees the US as its protector,"" said Liu Weidong, a research fellow at the Institute of US Studies at the China Academy of Social Sciences. ""The new Japan Prime Minister needs to show a sense of loyalty, or a sense of urgency to preserve bilateral ties.""  Liu told the Global Times that despite many issues covered, the meeting is unlikely to yield concrete results. ""It's more about making statements and expressing concerns about the appeal from the other.""  Some analysts said that by stressing the common ""opponents,"" Joe Biden has built rapport with Japan's former prime minister, Yoshihide Suga, and he hopes the same with Japan's new leader. The current focus of the US and Japan is different. The US pays the most attention to Ukraine, while Japan cares more about regional affairs, such as the Korean Peninsula issues, the Diaoyu Islands, and the Taiwan question, Liu noted. Some experts said the tone of the meeting would continue to be aimed at China and Russia, showing their intention to strengthen Japan-US military cooperation and expand intervention in Indo-Pacific affairs. By hyping the ""China, Russia threat theory,"" the US and Japan have further confirmed their mid- and long-term strategic goal: containing their two opponents.  Da Zhigang, director and research fellow of Institute of Northeast Asia Studies at the Heilongjiang Provincial Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times that despite Japan's inability to help the US over the standoff with Russia on the Ukraine crisis, re-emphasizing the Indo-Pacific region is a bid to show an ally's support for the US on global affairs.  Da added that having closer ties with the US over Indo-Pacific affairs is also Japan's response to Russia, which took a tough stance on their disputed islands. Kishida has only been in office for 100 days while Joe Biden found himself with his lowest approval rating when marking his first year in the White House. And they both face elections in 2022-- Japan's upper house of parliament in July and US midterm elections in November.Experts said while it's understandable to use diplomacy to boost flagging domestic credentials,    some differences and conflicts remain between the US and Japan, which would come up during the Joe Biden-Kishida teleconference. Resentment toward US troops has grown among the Japan, especially Okinawa residents who are suffering from an Omicron variant spike, which was partly caused by the presence of US troops, who have almost no travel barriers in and out of military camps.Disputes over steel and aluminum tariffs imposed by Donald Trump in 2018 are still in place, despite a joint statement earlier this week, calling on parties of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons to achieve a meaningful outcome. ""Although Japan intends to follow the US in all aspects to increase its ability to confront China and make a long-term plan, it is never willing to be in the real frontline of confronting China considering the close economic and trade ties with China. However, Japan will warn the US to be more vigilant if China-US relations improve,"" Liu said. Under such a mentality, although Japan is willing to follow the US in its Indo-Pacific strategy, it will not confront China as intensely as the US.",CHINA,DIPLOMACY,Photo:VCG,"Reporter, Beijing","Global Times reporter covering international affairs, cross-Straits relations and Chinese society; a captive of his experiences.","{'COD': ('MISC', 2), '19': ('MISC', 2), 'US': ('LOC', 9), 'Japan': ('LOC', 13), 'China': ('LOC', 3), 'North Korea': ('LOC', 2), 'Russia': ('LOC', 2), 'Ukraine': ('LOC', 2), 'Tokyo': ('LOC', 1), 'Joe Biden': ('PER', 4), 'Fumio Kishida': ('PER', 2), 'Jake Sullivan': ('PER', 2), 'Akiba Takeo': ('PER', 1), 'Bloomberg': ('PER', 1), 'Liu Wei': ('PER', 2), 'Kyodo': ('ORG', 1), 'Global Times': ('ORG', 2), 'Institute': ('ORG', 1), 'Academy': ('ORG', 1), 'B': ('ORG', 1)}"

110,"Biden on year one: disappointments in fighting COVID-19, healing divided society, fixing diplomacy and boosting economy",Yang Sheng,2022-01-19," One year ago, when Joe Biden became the new US president, many US and US allies, as well as the ""competitors"" or ""rivals"" in the eyes of US politicians like China and Russia, hoped his administration could fix the problems that his predecessor Donald Trump had left the US and the world. But now, most of them found that Joe Biden's performance is disappointing as well.   Joe Biden is not a young and energetic leader, and his image is old and slow, and it seems that his political experience did help him a lot in overcoming challenges, and although he wants to fix some mistakes in fields like handling COVID-19 pandemic, the systemic problem of US democracy - endless partisan struggle - has chained him from making meaningful changes, and an effective political reform to fix this systemic problem is almost a ""mission impossible"" for any US president, said experts.On foreign affairs, Joe Biden did make some changes such as the return to the Paris Agreement and to some extent the strengthened US ties with its allies. But the hasty pullout from Afghanistan has seriously damaged the image and credibility of the US, especially among countries that expected the US protection, analysts noted. They said that US tensions with China and Russia remain unchanged, and even getting more intense on the Ukraine issue and the Taiwan question. To cure the illness of the US is not about changing presidents, it requires an in-depth political reform, and most observers believe that the Democrats might lose the midterm election this year, and the Joe Biden administration could become a ""lame duck"" after the failure, and this would make China-US ties even more uncertain and complicated. Systemic problemOn domestic affairs, Joe Biden has some accomplishments, such as the passage of a $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package and a $1.2 trillion bipartisan infrastructure deal, but other challenges have overshadowed those feats: Perhaps most significantly, the fact that COVID-19 pandemic has not subsided, ABC News reported. Joe Biden's first-year average approval rating was 48.9 percent, according to Gallup, which ranked lower than many other US presidents but remained higher than Donald Trump. The main reason is that the US now faces a comprehensive general crisis. Even if Joe Biden wants to do something, the Republicans will tie his hands up, Li Haidong, a professor at the Institute of International Relations of the China Foreign Affairs University, told the Global Times on Wednesday.The US economy is also fragile to support Joe Biden's ambitions. The hollowing out of the economy and the long-existing insurmountable problems of the gaps between the rich and the poor are not something Joe Biden can solve, Li said.US feel worse about the pandemic and the economy than they did earlier in Joe Biden's term, and his ratings have suffered for it… they do not exclusively blame his policies, but they do demand more attention to inflation, said a report by CBS News on Sunday.Inflation is like ""quenching thirst with poison"" and the whole US economic system is relying on the easing of monetary policy amid the pandemic, and the problem is likely to cause another financial crisis, said some analysts. On handling the pandemic, ""the epidemic control and prevention has been politicized in the US,"" said Diao Damin, an associate professor at Renmin University of China. He noted that both Donald Trump and Joe Biden suffered from the similar problem during their terms, and ""Joe Biden's logic of epidemic prevention is still driven by political factors, not entirely following scientific logic.""""For instance, as the epidemic situation remains uncontrolled, in order to please the public and serve political demands rather than prioritize people's lives and public health, Joe Biden decided to reopen US borders in September 2021, and this has caused the high increase of cases,"" Diao remarked.Apart from fighting the pandemic and boosting the economy, Joe Biden has also failed to ""heal"" or reunite a divided US society, said experts, because both Democrats and Republicans are benefiting from or relying on such a divided and polarized situation, and they want to maximize their political interests.

Photo: Samuel Corum/Getty Images/VCGForeign affairsThe hasty pullout of US soldiers from Afghanistan is the symbol of Joe Biden's failing diplomacy, said many observers, as the US has showed that it's reluctant to keep its military presence and it doesn't want to be responsible for the mess it has created.The US has strengthened its alliance system to contain both China and Russia. But the AUKUS nuclear submarine deal that the US teamed up with the UK and Australia has caused great concern of an arms race and nuclear proliferation in the region, and this has made the world less secure and added more uncertainty, said analysts, noting that tensions on the Ukraine issue between the US-led NATO and Russia just proves that Joe Biden's slogan ""US is back"" is ""back to making things more complicated."" On China-US ties, China scholars said at a forum the China Institute of International Studies (CIIS) organized on Tuesday that ""according to the diplomatic activities done by the Joe Biden administration in the past year, it basically inherits the Donald Trump administration's China policy, but at the same time, China and the US are also seeking a new paradigm of mutual respect and having exchanges based on equality.""Intergovernmental communication and people-to-people exchanges have been restored, and China-US ties have been improved a little bit compared to the situation during Donald Trump's term, said the CIIS website. But most major problems remained unsolved, such as unfair economic sanctions against China firms, and the US is also using the island of Taiwan to contain the China mainland, said experts. They held that after the China-US meeting in Anchorage, Alaska earlier last year, China has had more confidence in shaping future bilateral ties with a straighter attitude. After the midterm In the 2022 midterm, the Democrats will be influenced by Joe Biden's poor performance. Moreover, there is a so-called pendulum effect in midterm elections, which means that when the president wins, the party usually loses seats in the midterm elections, Diao said. There is a good chance that the midterm elections will be extremely negative for Democrats, which could put pressure on Joe Biden for the last two years of his presidency, he noted.Jin Canrong, associate dean of the School of International Studies at the Renmin University of China, said that becoming a ""lame duck"" is not good news for the Joe Biden administration and for China-US ties, because Joe Biden could focus more on foreign affairs and he would like to be more aggressive rather than pragmatic to deal with US' ""competitors.""But other observers believe that Joe Biden would like to have a diplomatic legacy for the rest of his term on climate issue or fighting the pandemic, and he needs China's support, so the future of China-US ties would be complicated and uncertain.

112,US Coast Guard employed unconvincingly as proxy for American Naval presence in the Pacific,Scott Ritter,2022-01-17,"In a speech before the Navy League last December, the Commandant of the US Coast Guard, Admiral Karl Schultz, bragged about the role his forces played—the fifth and smallest of the five military services, and the only one not under the control of the Department of Defense (at least during peacetime)—in projecting US presence in the Pacific Ocean. ""We get access. We can go places,"" Schultz said, underscoring his comments by singling out the recent 102-day mission of the US Coast Guard Cutter Munro. During that time, the Munro trained with US partners in the East and China Seas, including operations which, as Schultz described, ""exercised"" a memorandum of understanding between the US and island of Taiwan. This ""exercise"" included a transit of the Taiwan Strait. According to Schultz, China was ""pretty excited when the Coast Guard is over there training with the Taiwanese,"" adding that the US Coast Guard mission in Taiwan was among several which ""move the needle a little bit"" when it comes to foreign reaction. The US Coast Guard conducts routine deployments into the area of responsibilities of US Naval Fleets, working alongside US partners and allies to build what its parent organization, the Department of Homeland Security, calls ""maritime domain awareness"" by sharing ""best practices"" with partner nation navies and coast guards. Coast Guard participation in these programs is viewed by the US Navy as enhancing its own mission of conducting so-called ""full-spectrum joint and naval operations"" in concert with allied and interagency partners in a manner that advances US national interests and security and stability in regions of interest, such as EU, Africa, the Middle East, and the Pacific.What makes the US Coast Guard particularly attractive in this role is its multi-dimensional mandate, which allows it to transition freely between the military and civilian world. While a purely US Naval presence somewhere in the world would be seen, rightly so, as an exclusively military intervention, the US Coast Guard can finesse this by claiming that its presence is related to maritime security, law enforcement, and maritime search and rescue. US analysts assess that China employs tactics against Taiwan island in support of its efforts in the China Sea which likewise crosses the boundary between the military and civilian domains, using fishing vessels, commercial vessels, and its own Coast Guard to collect intelligence and assert physical presence in disputed territories or waters, either for the purposes of fishing, exploring for oil, or simply establishing a presence. Confronting China using exclusively Naval forces, these analysts believe, could lead to undesired military-on-military escalation. However, by employing what are ostensibly civilian vessels, such as those of the US Coast Guard and the coast guards of allied nations, the US, according to these analysts, believes it can push back against China without triggering a military response.There is a difference, however, between how the US seeks to thread the needle when it comes to playing legalistic word games regarding the difference between an ostensibly civilian-oriented mission, and one that could be characterized as military in nature. Those responsible for defending the national security interests of a nation like China are, at the end of the day, not going to get tied up in the niceties of the lexicon, but rather respond to a perceived provocation with a response designed to deal with the threat as it exists, not as it is being sold. By trying to navigate in the legalistic grey zone between civil and military operations, employing the US Coast Guard as a proxy for US Naval presence, the US is only fooling itself and, by extension, its allies.Moreover, by deliberately abusing the legitimate maritime security and safety mission of the US and other allied Coast Guards as a cover for ""moving the needle"" in places like China and elsewhere (the US Coast Guard conducts similarly provocative operations in the Black Sea and the Persian Gulf, targeting Russia and Iran, respectively), the US is undermining legitimate maritime security by deliberately blurring the line between civilian and military operations. While senior US commanders such as Admiral Schultz might view such gamesmanship as contributing to deterrence by expanding the scope and scale of options available to US policymakers, the opposite is true—by allowing what was once viewed as purely civilian domains to be militarized, the US is reducing, not increasing, the deterrence value of such operations, thereby increasing, not decreasing, the potential for conflict. Needles, it seems, don't move by themselves, and when they do move, it's usually for a reason.  The author is a former US Marine Corps intelligence officer. opinion@globaltimes.com.cn",OPINION,VIEWPOINT,"Former U.S. Coast Guard patrol boats refitted for the Ukrainian navy are seen on board the cargo ship Ocean Grand arriving at the Black Sea port of Odessa, Ukraine,on November 23, 2021.

113,Biden’s first year marked by lows and challenges,Zhao Minghao,2022-01-17,"It's been one year since Joe Biden took office as US president. It is a tradition in the US for the president to deliver the State of Union address in January or February. However, Joe Biden decided to postpone it to March 1. This may indicate that the White House is not so confident about its accomplishments. Both Joe Biden and the Democratic Party will also have to face the serious challenge posed by the 2022 midterm elections in the US Congress. But things could get even worse in another two months.The Joe Biden administration is now facing five major governance challenges. They are the resurgence of COVID-19 epidemic, the supply chain crisis, high inflation, rising energy prices, and the migrant crisis at the US-Mexico border. Although the White House pushed Congress to pass the US Rescue Plan Act and Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, it's now experiencing the ""Joe Biden Bubble."" The US Department of Labor announced on January 12 that the country's consumer price index rose 7 percent in December, the highest increase since June 1982. The spread of the Omicron variant has cast a shadow over the US economy. The World Bank has cut its forecast for US economic growth once again.The supply chain crisis is closely related to the US-launched trade war. Yet, the Joe Biden administration is hesitant to make any change in its trade policy for fear of losing votes, and this, in turn, is hindering Joe Biden's economic performance. Even though US Trade Representative Katherine Tai has outlined a ""worker-centered trade policy,"" maintaining high tariffs on goods from countries like China has forced ordinary working families in the US to bear a huge cost. The policy Tai has been stressing may also discriminate against US workers because it's likely to only benefit workers in traditional manufacturing industries, like as those related to steel and aluminum production.Compared with the beginning of Joe Biden's presidency, the domestic political rift in the US has deepened. Joe Biden described the Jan 6 attack on the US Capitol as an attempted ""coup"" and accused Republicans of spreading lies about the 2020 US presidential elections. A poll in late December showed that a third of US still question the legitimacy of Joe Biden's victory a year since rioters breached the US Capitol. Republicans are planning to carry their push to reshape the nation's electoral system in an effort to influence the 2022 and 2024 elections.The fierce partisan dispute over voting rights reflects the seriousness of the democratic crisis in the US. Joe Biden criticized a new Georgia voting law, saying ""the votes of nearly 5 million Georgians will be up for grabs if that law holds."" The Freedom to Vote Act pushed by Democrats met huge resistance from Republicans in Congress.The internal division has exerted constraints on the Joe Biden administration's ambition to regain world leadership. Joe Biden emphasized ""US is back,"" but the world needs to first ask what the US is willing to do for it. The Joe Biden administration's diplomacy is in essence, the Democratic version of ""US first."" The general trend of the US competing with its allies and partners for interests continues. When dealing with the Joe Biden administration, US allies and partners worry that Donald Trump and the political forces he dominates will return to the White House in 2024. Any negotiations with the Joe Biden administration may be overturned two years later.  The Joe Biden administration's rash withdrawal from Afghanistan not only showed the failure of its strategy for advocating democracy, but also embarrassed NATO. The US sacrificed the interests of France to form the AUKUS alliance, which accelerated EU's pace to seek strategic autonomy. The US and NATO are becoming more and more assertive on the Ukraine issue, prompting the Vladimir Putin government to implement a policy of brinkmanship. Even if US does not make a written promise to Moscow, it is expected to compromise.China-US relations are agitated by the predicament the Joe Biden administration is facing. Joe Biden is trying to bridge the divergences between the Democratic and Republican parties by hyping China-related affairs, pushing forward his domestic policy agenda. However, obviously, the top threat to the US is the US itself. The Joe Biden administration needs to make great efforts to engage in nation-building from within. According to a January Quinnipiac University poll, 76 percent of the 1,313 adults polled believed instability in the US is a bigger danger to the US than other countries that are adversaries to the nation. 58 percent of the US polled said the nation's democracy is in danger of collapse.The author is a senior research fellow at the Charhar Institute and an adjunct fellow at the Chongyang Institute for Financial Studies at Renmin University of China. opinion@globaltimes.com.cn",OPINION,VIEWPOINT,Illustration: Chen Xia/GT,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'Joe Biden': ('PER', 7), 'Katherine Tai': ('PER', 2), 'US': ('LOC', 14), 'White House': ('LOC', 2), 'Mexico': ('LOC', 1), 'China': ('LOC', 1), 'State': ('MISC', 1), 'Union': ('MISC', 1), 'COVID - 19': ('MISC', 1), 'US Rescue Plan Act': ('MISC', 1), 'Bipartisan Infrastructure Law': ('MISC', 1), 'Joe Biden Bubble': ('MISC', 1), 'Omicron': ('MISC', 1), 'Republicans': ('MISC', 2), 'of': ('ORG', 1), 'Democratic Party': ('ORG', 1), 'US Congress': ('ORG', 2), 'US Department of Labor': ('ORG', 2), 'World Bank': ('ORG', 1), 'Capitol': ('ORG', 2)}"
114,"N.Korea reports new hypersonic missile test; US, Japan hypes move",Liu Xin,2022-01-13,"North Korean leader Kim Jong-UN attends a test-fire of hypersonic missile conducted by the Academy of Defense Science of the DPRK. Photo: VCG


North Korea on Wednesday reported the latest test of a hypersonic missile with the witness of North Korean leader Kim Jong-UN and missile analysts pointed out related data revealed that North Korea may have acquired the technologies but still needs more tests to demonstrate and enhance the weapon's accuracy. While the series of tests had not broken the arms balance in the region, Japan and the US are hyping the so-called threat to reinforce own military build-up, analysts said, saying the US' double standards have led to a de facto arms race that jeopardizes regional peace. The test on Tuesday was aimed at the final verification of overall technical specifications of the developed hypersonic weapon system, the KCNA reported.After its release from the missile, the hypersonic glide vehicle made glide jump flight from 600 kilometer before making a 240 kilometer corkscrew maneuver from the initial launch azimuth to the target azimuth, and hit the set target in waters 1,000 kilometers away, the KCNA report said.The superior maneuverability of the hypersonic glide vehicle was more strikingly verified through the final test, the KCNA said.The information released by North Korea remains limited, not enough to judge if the weapon is indeed a hypersonic weapon, but it gives many clues toward that conclusion, Wang Ya'nan, the chief editor of Beijing-based Aerospace Knowledge magazine, told the Global Times on Wednesday.The glide jump flight from 600 kilometers reflected a key characteristic of hypersonic weapons, as it shows that the weapon does not make a direct freefall on its target like a ballistic missile, but made a trajectory change to a lower and flatter trajectory, Wang said.The 240-kilometer corkscrew maneuver is even more challenging, because maneuvering is very challenging in hypersonic flight, and this corkscrew maneuver is likely performed to not only evade interception, but also to bide time for the missile to search for and lock on its target, Wang explained.Tuesday's test is the third such launch announced by the KCNA. The first test was announced on September 29, 2021, which confirmed the navigational control and stability of the missile in the active section and also its technical specifications including the guiding maneuverability and the gliding flight characteristics of the detached hypersonic gliding warhead, the KCNA reported at the time, noting that it also ascertained the stability of the engine as well as of missile fuel ampoule introduced for the first time.The second test, announced by the KCNA on January 6, reconfirmed the flight control and stability of the missile in the active-flight stage and assessed the performance of the new lateral movement technique applied to the detached hypersonic gliding warhead.More details were given this time, as the KCNA revealed that the missile made a 120 kilometers lateral movement in the flight distance of the hypersonic gliding warhead from the initial launch azimuth to the target azimuth and precisely hit a set target 700 kilometers away, and the reliability of the fuel ampoule system under winter conditions was also verified.Comparing the reports on the three tests, more challenging technologies were tested with each, observers pointed out.While these tests provided some insights into North Korea's rapid hypersonic weapon development, analysts remain uncertain about the weapon's true capability in combat. While a hypersonic speed of higher than Mach 5 can be easily achieved with a booster rocket used by any ballistic missile, and the glide vehicle can seemingly make glide jumps and maneuvers that qualifies the weapon as hypersonic, the terminal-phase guidance is the most challenging technology to make the weapon useful, Wang said. It requires a very complex and coordinated work of sensors, hypersonic flight control and probably also data transfer from satellites, drones and large reconnaissance aircraft to guide the weapon to its target, Wang said, questioning if all these problems have been solved.North Korea has put many resources to develop the hypersonic weapon, and some progress must have been made, but whether the weapon can hit its target accurately as the report claimed cannot be verified as for now, Wang said. The test showed the missile's hypersonic speed and high maneuverability it needs to penetrate hostile defenses. But convincing evidence needs to be shown in order for the public to know if the missile can hit its target accurately, according to Wang.The continuous tests showcased North Korea's eagerness to acquire the technologies of hypersonic missiles in dealing with the challenges brought by missile defense systems built by the US, Japan and South Korea, said China military expert and commentator Song Zhongping.Song told the Global Times that development of ballistic or hypersonic missiles is more like a shortcut to bolster North Korea's defense capability given its lack of advanced aircraft or other surface ships. Hypersonic missiles, with its ability to hit targets in the blink of an eye, would make the US, Japan and South Korea think twice before taking rash actions. Warning to Japan, USNorth Korean leader Kim Jong-UN attended the Tuesday test, KCNA reported.  Kim's high-profile appearance shows North Korea wants to showcase the breakthrough on new technologies and to maintain domestic morale, said Lü Chao, a fellow at the Liaoning Academy of Social Sciences, noting that it is also a political tradition and gesture to launch missiles and also attend the launching before important festivals. The expert told the Global Times that North Korea will embrace the 80th anniversary of the Day of the Shining Star on February 16, a public holiday to celebrate the birth of the country's second leader Kim Jong-il. North Korea also wants to remind the US to be engaged or have negotiations with it given that the discussions at the UN on lifting its sanctions is being stalled by the US, and the Joe Biden administration seems to have adopted the silent treatment to North Korea from the Obama era, Lü said. Song said North Korea tested hypersonic missiles to pressure the US and its hostile policy. As long as North Korea faces severe challenges to its political system and security from the US, it will take all measures as defense. The expert said the US and Japan are twisting the concept of denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula into ""denuclearization of North Korea"" - supporting Japan to develop its military capability while sanctioning North Korea - which North Korea and China would not allow. ""Under US double standards, an arms race has already started,"" Song noted.    North Korea's Tuesday test came on the heels of the high-level ""2-plus-2"" meetings between the US secretary of state and secretary of defense and the Japan foreign minister and defense minister, during which they signed agreements to develop counter hypersonic capabilities targeting China and North Korea. The Japan Prime Minister Fumio Kishida met with Australia Prime Minister Scott Morrison on January 6 and signed a reciprocal access agreement to ramp up defense cooperation, a pact that experts said could inflame regional tensions.  The North Korea tests did not break the arms balance between North and South Korea or between North Korea and Japan. But Japan is hyping it as an opportunity to expand a military build-up and some Japan right-wing politicians even urged the development of nuclear weapons by Japan, Lü told the Global Times.""Japan's military expansion is more dangerous to regional countries than the tests of North Korea,"" said Lü. Analysts noted that by hyping threats from North Korea, Japan also aims to revise the Peace Constitution and further push to the right for collective self-defense, which has already started. Kyodo News reported that Japan Prime Minister Fumio Kishida on Tuesday condemned North Korea's actions and called the continuing launches ""extremely regrettable."" Japan officials have been asked to be prepared to respond to any emergency. On the same day, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki called the North Korean launch ""destabilizing.""US announced on Wednesday to sanction five North Koreans after the missile launch.Experts noted that South Korea responded to the news calmly. South Korea responded to the tests with an emergency meeting of the National UN and President Moon Jae-in expressed concerns over the series of launches coming ahead of the South Korea presidential election on March 9. Some South Korea officials also cast doubt on the capability of the hypersonic missile North Korea claimed to have tested. No stronger or any actions that may be seen as ""provocations"" have been made by South Korea. Lü said his friends in South Korea said that the government is closely monitoring the tests and  South Koreans are also paying close attention to the tests. But more people in South Korea are holding a wait-and-see attitude, and few want to hype the issue. China's stance is consistent and hopes every party solves Korean Peninsula issues with the ""dual track"" approach, Wang Wenbin, spokesperson of the China Foreign Ministry, told a press conference on Wednesday, in response to the test-launch.China also firmly opposes actions that will destroy the peace and stability of the Korean Peninsula and is working to draw related parties to go back to the negotiating table, Lü said. Lü noted that considering that Joe Biden administration is struggling with tensions with Russia in Ukraine and tons of domestic problems, he may have no time to deal with Korean Peninsula issues. The joint military drill between South Korea and the US may be an important timing to observe whether there will be changes in US policy toward North Korea.",CHINA,DIPLOMACY,"North Korea conducts a hypersonic missile test-fire, according to KCNA.

115,What is behind the unrest in Kazakhstan?,Xin Ping,2022-01-13,"On Tuesday, President of Kazakhstan Kassym-Jomart Tokayev made it clear that the worst of the trouble was perpetrated as part of an elaborate conspiracy of yet-unspecified international terrorist groups. Thanks to the swift anti-terrorist operation, constitutional order has been restored in Kazakhstan. While the world was still enjoying New Year celebrations, no one expected to see tens of thousands of organized gangsters plunge Kazakhstan, the wealthiest Central Asia country, into nationwide unrest overnight. Indeed, the escalation of hostilities showed traces of a premeditated, organized anti-government movement. It would be impossible for workers of a local factory in grievance of the rising LNG price to professionally mobilize and even pay thousands of people to protest, let alone destroy crucial facilities with arms, burn down government buildings, shoot police with rifles, and occupy the Almaty Airport and control airplanes. A Kazakhstan news program showed that a Kyrgyz protester confessed to having taken $200 and a plane ticket to travel to Kazakhstan to protest.Then how was the public anger over economic plight turned into a political movement and how did a peaceful demonstration escalate into violence and riots? It is unusual that the tension did not cool down even when the Kazakh government had agreed to halt the LNG price hike and released people detained at the Aktau rally. It turned out that the demonstrators reached out for a yard after having taken an inch: They asked for a direct dialogue with the president and shouted political slogans like ""Nazarbayev leave the country.""For anyone who follows international affairs, there is a sense of déjà vu: Scenes of violence in Kazakhstan easily reminded people of the ""color revolutions"" in regional countries. Just eight years ago in Ukraine, hundreds of thousands of rioters devastated central Kiev with violence and bloodshed. US and EU countries, while inciting the rebels with propaganda and promises, threatened the Yanukovych government with sanctions until a pro-West regime was inaugurated. In Kyrgyzstan, upheaval has become an unwelcome visitor ever since the West-supported Tulip Revolution. In Kazakhstan, professional inciters were hired to maneuver public sentiments and turn originally peaceful protesters into terrorists, who would then be provided with food, supplies and funds to confront the police and occupy key infrastructure. Mukhtar Ablyazov, the dissident leader in exile, rode the tide to invite the West countries to enter the fray, while social media posts encouraged people to ""fight back, create resistance groups and organize attacks."" Since the very beginning, there has been much suspicion and speculation about foreign forces getting involved, or even manipulating behind the scenes. The presence and influence of West countries and foreign nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) in Kazakhstan might give some clues. For a long time, the looming shadow of the US has been cast in every corner of Kazakhstan. It is by no means a coincidence that the US seemed to have predicted the situation unfolding and escalating. Half a month before the riots broke out, the US Embassy in Kazakhstan warned that demonstrations in Nur-Sultan and Almaty could escalate into violence. A batch of NGOs sponsored by the US, smelling a storm, swiftly retreated from the country.  The International Center for Not-for-Profit Law (ICNL) estimates there are 38,000 active NGOs in Kazakhstan while the majority of them  ̶  some say around 20,000  ̶  are funded by US and EU countries by way of grants and donations, including the US Agency for International Development (USAID), the National Endowment for Democracy (NED), and Freedom House.Among them, the NED alone spent more than $1 million to support the so-called democratic processes and human rights movements in Kazakhstan in 2020, according to data published by the organization. The funds were used to increase the youth's engagement in social and political processes, support the allegedly independent mass media, and protect civil society in Kazakhstan. Executive Vice President of Eurasia Group Earl Rasmussen told the hard truth recently: Generous funding from international NGOs and the US government has played a key role in the social unrest that has gripped Kazakhstan.  The author is a commentator on international affairs, writing regularly for Global Times, China Daily etc. He can be reached at xinping604@gmail.com.",OPINION,VIEWPOINT,"People rally to protest against the price rise of liquefied petroleum gas in Aktau in the Mangystau province, Kazakhstan, Jan. 4, 2022.

119,Will NATO be left in the cold in Washington’s offensive toward Russia?,Cui Hongjian,2022-01-12,"Worries about the risk of war in Ukraine have led to negotiations between Russia and the West, including the US, NATO, and Organization for Security and Cooperation in EU. The latest round of US-Russia security talks proves that the US is neither prepared nor able to mount an assertive diplomatic offensive toward Russia. But the two sides seem to have reached some consensus on the need to ""cool down"" the situation in Ukraine. This made NATO, which held a meeting with Russia on Wednesday, somewhat embarrassed.As a buffer between the West and Russia, Ukraine is a decisive factor in the geopolitical game between Russia and the West. It is the main geopolitical defense for Russia if it turns East, and a strategic high ground for the West to suppress Russia if it turns West. Therefore, the Ukraine crisis and the solution to it demonstrate the game between Russia and the West.The Joe Biden administration has made a gesture of providing security protection for EU. Regarding Russia, the US has been engaging in the bilateral strategic stability dialogue to make ""nonfatal"" rules in the game between the two countries. At the same time, the US encourages NATO and Ukraine to cooperate closely, especially around the Black Sea (in other words, NATO's eastern flank), to strengthen the strategic offensive against Russia.The solution to the Ukraine problem under the leadership of US is to use NATO to launch an offensive against Russia. This essentially deviates from the EU approach that focuses more on diplomatic negotiations and interest exchange. Therefore, the situation in Ukraine will shift rapidly toward military confrontation.The latest round of US-Russia talks was followed by a meeting between NATO and Russia. Even though no substantial progress will be made during the latter event, both sides may still get what they want. Russia could try to obtain favorable bargaining chips in the negotiations by threatening to end engagement with NATO at any time. As for NATO, it may regard the negotiations as a result of being tough on Russia and forcing it to restart dialogue. In this way, NATO can prove that it still has a role to play in EU-Russia relations and EU security.However, after gaining limited ""political results,"" NATO needs to face an embarrassing reality: After Russia and the US signaled a consensus on cooling down the Ukraine situation during their talks, will the value of NATO to the US be greatly reduced? If in subsequent negotiations Russia insists that NATO suspend cooperation with Ukraine and stop eastward expansion, how can NATO prove its ""value"" to the US by emphasizing its ""obligations"" to Ukraine? The US and NATO view Ukraine as a partner but did not grant it NATO membership. In this way, they want to gain an upper hand in their game with Russia. They could not only stir up the regional situation by providing Ukraine with military equipment and holding joint military exercises, but also use ""Ukraine is not a NATO member"" as an excuse to avoid open confrontation with Russia. But Russia has already seen through such tricks by the US and NATO. Therefore, Moscow is forcing NATO to clarify its relationship with Ukraine amid the escalation of military confrontation to avoid strategic consumption. If NATO cannot stop this round of strategic and diplomatic counter-offensives from Russia, all the ""achievements"" it gained from squeezing Russia's room on both the eastern and West fronts will vanish. The Ukraine crisis and the US-Russia interaction have made EU uncomfortable and anxious. In order to take its fate into its own hands, EU should put strategic autonomy into real practice. It should make up its mind to ""prioritize EU solutions to EU problems."" The price for relying on others is vulnerability to others' influence. To resolve the Ukraine issue, it's necessary for EU to make the relevant parties rebuild confidence in the Normandy format. When it comes to relations with Russia, it's necessary to promote de-escalation through dialogues as France and Germany suggested, and promote bilateral relations to a state of stability. Regarding issues that concern its own security, NATO should influence and constrain the US through the US-EU bilateral mechanism and the NATO framework instead of becoming a chess piece to be sacrificed by the US. The author is director of the Department of EU Studies, China Institute of International Studies. opinion@globaltimes.com.cn",OPINION,VIEWPOINT,Photo: IC,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'Ukraine': ('LOC', 9), 'Russia': ('LOC', 19), 'West': ('LOC', 6), 'US': ('LOC', 10), 'East': ('LOC', 1), 'Black Sea': ('LOC', 1), 'NATO': ('ORG', 13), 'Organization for Security and Cooperation in EU': ('ORG', 5), 'Joe Biden': ('PER', 1)}"
120,Delusional for US to overwhelm China and Russia by brute force: Global Times editorial,Global Times,2022-01-11,"The US and organizations including NATO will hold a series of emergency meetings with Russia this week, beginning with Monday's US-Russia meeting in Geneva. Then it moves on to the Russia-NATO in Brussels on Wednesday and ends on Thursday's meeting in Vienna at the Organization for Security and Cooperation in EU (OSCE). Russia-US relations as well as Russia-EU relations continue to be strained by the Ukraine issue, which has been described as a ""post-Cold War Cuban missile crisis."" The three rounds of talks in this context, like a master match on the big geopolitical chess game, will have a direct impact on the ensuing regional situation.Before the talks started, the US, EU and Russia had been blaming one another for a long time, with the US constantly playing up the possibility of a Russia ""invasion"" of Ukraine, while Russia emphasized the security threat posed to Russia by NATO's eastward expansion. Only with a wider horizon can we see more clearly the context and internal logic of the current crisis in Ukraine.Since the end of the Cold War, the US has promoted rounds of NATO eastward expansion in disregard to Russia's strong opposition, eventually pushing Russia into a corner. If Ukraine joins NATO, the US missiles deployed in Kiev can reach Moscow in just five minutes. The US accuses Russia of ""holding a gun pointed to Ukraine's head,"" while the US is targeting its own missiles at Moscow's heart. In the past 30 years, the US elites have always viewed Russia with the arrogance of a ""victor,"" believing that Russia is the ""loser"" in the Cold War and deserves to be ""punished."" In their mind, Russia should be submissively lying on the edge of EU, being bullied by the US and its allies.So far, the US and the West have slapped more than 100 sanctions on Russia, sparing no effort to suppress a major power ""from a position of strength."" Before this dialogue, the US and NATO had warned Russia with a sense of intimidation. In the dictionary of US, ""respect"" is rarely seen. US's real intent is to pressure Russia until it surrenders, so as to get rid of this threat to US hegemony for good. In a sense, the US has brutally forced Russia to become an ""enemy."" With this ""enemy,"" US can hold EU closer to itself. While pushing NATO to expand eastward, the US is also hyping Russophobia in EU. Consequently, relatively new members to NATO are generally hostile to Russia. The anti-Russia sentiment is at a peak in Ukraine, which is not a wise move for the country. Because this will put it at risk between two major powers - but this meets US's strategic demands.Talking about these meetings, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said, ""We can't go back to a world of spheres of influence"" like the one during the Cold War era. However, from South US to Central US, from Southeast Asia to Northeast Asia, which country on earth is ganging up and forming ""small circles""? As the Warsaw Pact dissolved and many former Soviet states have tilted toward the West, with some having become NATO members, which country is the one cultivating ""spheres of influence""?To some extent, China can empathize with what Russia is going through. In EU, US is trying its best to contain, suppress, and squeeze out Russia through mechanisms such as NATO; in the Asia-Pacific region, it is trying to pressure China with similar tricks. Perhaps the US' successful experience in the Cold War has made the US overconfident so that the US political elites have taken out their rusted Cold War weapons against the world in a new era. Nevertheless, the world has already changed. It will eventually be proven that the infringement of other countries' core interests and the violation of international equality and justice will not bring another ""victory"" to US as it has wished. US still has deep-rooted hegemonic thinking, but its hegemony is something tough outside but cowardly inside. Therefore, the world has seen a tangled US: It on one hand acts maliciously against other major powers but cannot really give up negotiations on the other hand. As a matter of fact, the US doesn't have much capital to squander on great-power relations; its ""position from strength"" cannot support its hegemonic ambitions. And the times will not give it such an opportunity either.",OPINION,EDITORIAL,"A view shows the building of the US Permanent Mission to the UN Office where the talks on security guarantees between Russia and the United States are held, in Geneva, Switzerland.

121,Russia withstands pressure as talks with US kick off in intensive vibe,Wang Qi,2022-01-11," After two rounds of dialogue between Russia President Vladimir Putin and his US counterpart Joe Biden in December 2021, senior diplomats from Russia and US held talks on Monday in Geneva, dubbed the ""capital of peace,"" amid the Russia-Ukraine border tension and days of violent protests in Kazakhstan, a former Soviet Union republic state. The meeting, attended by Russia Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov and US Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman, kicked off in a pessimistic atmosphere as Moscow said on Sunday that it would not make any concessions under US' pressure while US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said he doesn't think there will be any breakthroughs in the coming week. The meeting will be followed by a Russia-NATO meeting in Brussels on Wednesday and a meeting with the Organization for Security and Cooperation in EU (OSCE) on Thursday.Prior to the meeting, Russia clarified its demands including the ban on further NATO expansion in EU and insisting NATO must never grant membership to Ukraine to join the military alliance.     Russia's surrounding regions showed signs of increased instability with rising tensions on border with Ukraine and recent riots in Kazakhstan. Analysts said that the possibility of Russia's demands met through the rounds of dialogues is near zero, but Moscow's tough counterattack has effectively safeguarded Russia interests, and resisted West pressure to squeeze Russia strategic space.  Besides, US' Cold War mentality has substantially alienated the other two major powers within the China-Russia-US trilateral ties, bringing China and Russia closer, which may force the US to reflect upon itself after repeated setback, said the experts. Pressure and counterattackIn two talks with Vladimir Putin last December, Joe Biden has warned of ""severe consequences"" of any Russia ""invasion"" of Ukraine. Antony Blinken on Sunday also stressed that Moscow must choose between confrontation and dialogue, according to media reports. ""Naturally, we will not make any concessions under pressure,"" said Ryabkov, who is leading the Russia delegation to Geneva. Ryabkov also revealed that his talks with senior US diplomats on the eve of Monday's meeting was ""complex but businesslike,"" media reported. In December 2021, Russia made public a draft treaty on security in which it proposed to the US on security guarantees. It urged the US to prevent further eastward expansion of NATO, as ""both countries shall not undertake actions nor participate in or support activities that affect the security of each other,"" Xinhua reported. ""There are serious differences between the US and Russia in terms of EU security, the situation in Ukraine, and the eastward expansion of NATO… Both sides released pessimistic views in advance, which actually put pressure on the other side by lowering expectations, so that the other side would not ask too high a price in the negotiation,"" Zhang Hong, an EU studies expert from the China Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times on Monday.Russia has expressed its willingness to pursue peace, warning the US and NATO that it is putting on the table possible solutions for a smooth, cooperative solution to the crisis in Ukraine before it deteriorates further into military conflict, Zhang said, noting Russia will gain the initiative in international opinion.On the same day of Ryabkov-Sherman talk, an online meeting of the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO) convened, discussing the situation in Kazakhstan, with Vladimir Putin attending.Zhang said that although the recent unrest in Kazakhstan was seen as a ""black swan"" event in Russia's neighboring region, Moscow's rapid action of sending CSTO peacekeepers may increase its leverage and confidence in the following meetings, as Kazakhstan has gradually stabilized thanks to Russia's efforts.  The negotiations between the US and Russia will be difficult and lengthy, but that does not mean that the two sides are not ready to compromise, especially when the US is running out of sanction measures against Russia, experts noted.  The shortage of energy supplies, especially oil and gas in EU, could strengthen Russia's hand and diminish the options available to the US for sanctions against Russia, Zhang said.  Zhao Huirong, an expert fromthe Institute of Russia, EU and Central Asia Studies under the China Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times that US is seeking a stable and more predictable relationship with Russia… and sending troops in a direct military conflict between Russia and Ukraine is unlikely to be an option.  Zhao said kicking Russia out of the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT) is one way to impose sanctions, but that would hurt both the US and EU, because energy trade must be cleared using the system.  Stabilizer & destructor China President Xi Jinping held a phone call with Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko on Monday, saying against the backdrop of profound and complex changes in the international and regional landscape, the two countries should continue to cooperate closely, practice true multilateralism and uphold equity and justice in the international community.  On the same day, China State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi held a phone call with Kazakhstan's deputy prime minister and foreign minister Mukhtar Tileuberdi, expressing China's determination to maintain regional stability in Central Asia, when ""external forces"" do not want peace and tranquility in our region.""  Li Haidong, professor at the Institute of International Relations from the China Foreign Affairs University, told the Global Times on Monday that China is a stabilizer and peacebuilder in the uncertain world, adding that a large part of the destabilizing factors in the world stem from those countries and groups with a Cold War mentality that fail to treat other civilizations as equals or respect other countries' systems  Some experts said while US-Russia negotiations are likely to find some areas of agreements like slowing down the pace of the arms race and limiting the size and number of military exercises in the Black Sea and Baltic regions, the situation in Ukraine is likely to further deteriorate.  A prolonged high-intensity rivalry and collision between the US, NATO and Russia over Ukraine, rather than a direct military conflict, is the most likely outcome, Li said.   And China is not unfamiliar with the tragedy of division and confrontation caused by US-led geopolitical competition: the US has long incited tensions in the Taiwan Straits and the China Sea.  Without regional turmoil, division and crisis, it would be impossible for the US to play a ""leading role"" in international affairs, and precisely because of the division, crisis and turmoil, the US was able to continuously strengthen the alliance system it built during the Cold War, which ended up bringing higher intensity of confrontation and conflict, Li said. ""The US has pushed both Russia and China into a corner, leaving the two countries with no other way out but strengthening strategic cooperation and forming closer ties,"" Li said. The US will suffer more setbacks in the handling of its relationships with China and Russia, when the two consolidate closer coordination and cooperation in the face of US pressure, US will be forced into self-reflection and readjustment which is similar to its mentality after setbacks in Vietnam, Iraq and Afghanistan, Li said. But for now, the US is still the biggest destructive force and source of risks in the international order and global system, Li noted.",CHINA,DIPLOMACY,"Deputy US Secretary of State Wendy Sherman (left) and

122,Wider regions feel ripples from Kazakhstan chaos,Sheradil Baktygulov,2022-01-11," Since the beginning of 2022, Kazakhstan has become the top newsmaker internationally. Worrisome events settled over the former Kazakhstani capital of Almaty after organized groups of rebels attacked government buildings, police stations, and even the Kazakh National Security Committee's Almaty branch building in broad daylight in early January. Stability in Kazakhstan has been undermined by several factors, most of which were related to natural rent distribution, internal political development and geopolitics. It looks like ""a bowl of well-mixed noodles."" Kazakhstan has avoided turning into one of the most dangerous places on the planet thanks to the decisive actions taken by Kazakhstani President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev. Kazakhstan sits between Russia and China with Iran, Azerbaijan, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, and Turkmenistan to the south. The chaos in Kazakhstan would have a direct effect on all of these countries. Offshoots of chaos will be experienced at the international level. The largest ramifications will be in Ukraine and Syria.Against this backdrop, Russia would be gripped by pliers of chaos, and China and some Central Asia countries would face threats of chaos on their own doorsteps. What happened in Kazakhstan could be the first stage of chaos intervention into the Central Asia nations. The inner values of humanities are blocked by crossing the ""red line"": the Kazakhs were reported to have beat, knifed and shot each other. The situation in Kazakhstan has been put under control. After that, several weeks will be spent to finally stabilize the political and social situation in Kazakhstan. The ruined buildings will be restored, but the ruined hearts will keep pain. But united people with sound ambitions and a wise president could endure the pain together. Meanwhile, we should learn from these woeful lessons. Newly appointed State Secretary Erlan Karin said on Monday, ""I think we encountered a hybrid terrorist attack on Kazakhstan that, as its end goal, sought general destabilization and possibly a coup."" He believed the previous scenario of ""color revolutions"" in relation to Kazakhstan would be ineffective. He said the unrest represented a ""conspiracy of internal and certain external forces"" as the terrorists included Kazakh and foreign nationals.So, Kazakhstan faces a new type of so-called color revolution - more aggressive, more organized and with more human casualties. It could be better described as a ""rebellious war."" President Tokayev has described the deadly violence taking place last week as an attempted coup d'etat.The new scenario has the following stages. After the mainly peaceful protests, marginalized groups created general chaos. Then the criminal groups started to act as a kind of vanguard in the confrontation with law enforcement, thus the crimes gained the attention and resources of law enforcement. Finally, targeted terrorist attacks destroyed communications, police stations (because of its arsenals) and blocked firefighters and doctors from their duties. The replacement of one person in power by another person is not the primary goal at this time. The primary goal could be to sow the seeds of chaos in the minds and hearts of people in the Central Asia countries. This goal has been achieved to some extent. We should understand that this is the opening move in a game of chess. The making of a chaotic state in Central Asia has not failed, and is not finished yet.  We should stay united to protect our values. We are different from one another, we have different levels of religious belief, and we have different habits. Diversity is our advantage since we can complement one another when sharing the same values and wishes - the prosperity of our motherlands, our nations, our families and closest ties. No one can get rich at the expense of another, but working together, everyone can get rich and build a wealthy, fair state. The author is an independent political analyst based in Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan. opinion@globaltimes.com.cn",OPINION,VIEWPOINT,"Russian military vehicles moving along an airfield after a military cargo plane landing in Almaty, Kazakhstan on January 9, 2022.",Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'Kazakhstan': ('LOC', 11), 'Almaty': ('LOC', 2), 'Russia': ('LOC', 2), 'China': ('LOC', 2), 'Iran': ('LOC', 1), 'Azerbaijan': ('LOC', 1), 'Kyrgyzstan': ('LOC', 1), 'Uzbekistan': ('LOC', 1), 'Turkmenistan': ('LOC', 1), 'Ukraine': ('LOC', 1), 'Syria': ('LOC', 1), 'Central Asia': ('LOC', 2), 'Kazakhstani': ('MISC', 2), 'Kazakhs': ('MISC', 1), 'Kazakh': ('ORG', 1), 'National Security Committee': ('ORG', 1), 'Kassym - Jomart Tokayev': ('PER', 1), 'Erlan Karin': ('PER', 1), 'Kazak': ('PER', 1), 'So': ('PER', 1)}"
123,US ready for Ukraine showdown,Xinhua,2022-01-10," The security talks between the US and Russia in Geneva scheduled for Monday have drawn attention from the international community.The talks are expected to focus on the NATO (NATO) and the rising tensions in Ukraine.

124,Kazakhstan’s crisis highlights US angst toward Russia,Danil Bochkov,2022-01-10,"The international political calendar in 2022 began with a very strained security situation in Kazakhstan, a country traditionally known to have one of the most stable political regimes of the post-Soviet states. Many of these states already went through the processes of political imbroglios and power redistribution during ""color revolutions"" which engulfed Armenia, Georgia, Ukraine, Kyrgyzstan, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Moldova and Uzbekistan between 2000 and 2020. Some aftershocks occurred later and were exemplified by the 2011-13 Russia protests, the Ukraine political crisis of 2013-14, the 2019-20 Uzbekistan protests, the 2020 Kyrgyzstani protests and the 2020-21 Belarus protests. This time, unrest in Kazakhstan does not resemble the previous protests that rolled over the country in 2011 and 2016 which were mostly associated with economic inefficiencies and other social issues. This time though, they also commenced with widespread public outrage following the doubling of gas prices. The unrest quickly turned brutal, causing violence, street crossfire and plunder. More than a dozen law enforcement officers were murdered and more than 100 fatalities are reported among the protesters. Now, although the root causes behind the riots can be debated, one takeaway remains clear - this unrest is going to have significant ramifications for regional and global politics since the outer players are either involved directly (Russia) or closely monitoring the ongoing developments (China, the US and the EU). Moscow's participation in the events is driven by Kazakh President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev's official request to the Russia-led Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO) to provide a peacekeeping contingent in order to sooth the uprising. The reported number of forces is limited to 2,500 with the core comprised of Russia servicemen. Additionally, the other CSTO members such as Armenia, Belarus, the Kyrgyz Republic, and Tajikistan have also expedited forces to buttress the Russia military. This is the first time that the security mechanism of the CSTO has been enacted with the actual deployment of troops for a peacekeeping mission. Earlier it was used only during joint combat drills and remained idle the rest of the time. Such a milestone in the group's security profile elevates its significance as a peacekeeping regional mechanism and resonates with resentment in US, which does not wish to see Moscow acquiring more leverage over its former Soviet allies. No wonder the US doubted Kazakh motives to call Russia in and warned the country's authorities to stay vigilant and not fall into dependency on Russia. It all speaks to US angst over Russia's growing regional influence. It also goes in tune with its EU allies who also have questioned Russia involvement in the crises. The EU's foreign policy chief Josep Borrell was on a two-day trip to Ukraine in a demonstration of solidarity ahead of the Russia-US security talks scheduled for January 10. On Thursday, he hinted at Russia when saying that external military assistance to Kazakhstan revokes ""memories of situations to be avoided."" EU media was similarly fueling the fire by predicting that Russia is slated to ""cement its influence"" there and speculated about annexation of North Kazakhstan on Crimea's template.The escalation between Russia and the West happens amid alleged Russia troops buildup on the border with Ukraine. Following the footsteps of US President Joe Biden who earlier warned Russia of ""devastating"" consequences, Borrell also promised ""massive"" consequences should it attack Ukraine. So, the US and EU approach to Russia will only grow more hostile, since both will regard Russia intentions on post-Soviet space with more suspicion following its active, and so far efficient, response to the Kazakh political crisis. The Kazakhstan turmoil has again reassured a close-knit Russia-China partnership since both countries have deprecated infiltrated groups of foreign-backed terrorists and opposed external forces ""fomenting color revolution."" Beijing has also offered to stabilize the situation with the help of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) and stressed that all member states are willing to help, which speaks to its collaboration with Russia on the issue since Moscow is also part of the security group. On the same day, the SCO's Anti-Terrorist Structure published a separate proposition to assist Kazakh authorities upon an official request, which signifies that SCO members may cooperate on such issues in the future providing each other with relevant assistance in placating public riots. The author is an expert at the Russia International Affairs Council. opinion@globaltimes.com.cn",OPINION,VIEWPOINT,Illustration: Chen Xia/Global Times,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'Kazakhstan': ('LOC', 2), 'Armenia': ('LOC', 2), 'Georgia': ('LOC', 1), 'Ukraine': ('LOC', 2), 'Kyrgyzstan': ('LOC', 1), 'Azerbaijan': ('LOC', 1), 'Belarus': ('LOC', 3), 'Moldova': ('LOC', 1), 'Uzbekistan': ('LOC', 2), 'Russia': ('LOC', 6), 'China': ('LOC', 1), 'US': ('LOC', 3), 'Moscow': ('LOC', 2), 'Kyrgyz Republic': ('LOC', 1), 'Tajikistan': ('LOC', 1), 'Kazak': ('LOC', 1), 'post - Soviet': ('MISC', 2), 'Kyrgyzstani': ('MISC', 1), 'Kazakh': ('MISC', 1), 'EU': ('ORG', 1), 'Collective Security Treaty Organization': ('ORG', 1), 'CSTO': ('ORG', 3), 'Kassym - Jomart Tokayev': ('PER', 1)}"
125,"China, Russia won’t part ways, but will continue to meet challenges cooperatively",Global Times,2022-01-10," Ukraine media outlet Obozrevatel on Saturday published an article arguing China is ""not happy with"" Russia-led troops arriving in Kazakhstan and has been ""hiding its irritation."" Despite how astonishing such rhetoric is, the article went on to say China has a strong tool to make Russia leave Kazakhstan - refusing Russia athletes to participate in the upcoming Winter Olympic Games. The argument echoes some US analysts, such as Tony Nash, CEO of Houston-based AI platform Complete Intelligence, who on Friday tweeted, ""I wonder if Kazakhstan could be where Russia and China start to part ways.""The argument is inconceivable. Kazakhstan has been maintaining good ties with both China and Russia, and a stable situation there is something both Beijing and Moscow are happy to see. China State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi made clear the stance of the China side during a call with Kazakhstan's Foreign Minister Mukhtar Tileuberdi on Monday. Wang said that recent turmoil in Kazakhstan shows the situation in Central Asia is still facing severe challenges, and once again proves that some external forces do not want peace and tranquility in the region. Wang went on to say that China was willing to jointly oppose interference and infiltration of any external forces. China Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin expressed a similar attitude last week, ""China supports all efforts that will help the Kazakh authorities to restore calm as soon as possible and firmly opposes the acts by external forces to deliberately create social instability and instigate violence in Kazakhstan."" Given Ukraine's past contradictions with Russia, some Ukrainians are taking advantage of the chaos in Kazakhstan, trying to play China and Russia off against each other. Westerners are even more eager to see China and Russia ""part ways.""But in terms of the situation in Kazakhstan, and the larger region - Central Asia, the common interests between China and Russia surely outweigh their divergences. For Russia, Kazakhstan is not only a member of the Commonwealth of Independent States, but also a member of the Eurasian Economic Union and the Collective Security Treaty Organization. For China, Kazakhstan is not only a member of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, but also a crucial part of the China-proposed Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). Be it promoting regional economic and trade cooperation, preventing West forces from infiltrating or stopping the ""three evils,"" namely terrorism, separatism and extremism, China and Russia have a large range of common interests and consensus in the region. The US has been establishing or funding tens of thousands of nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) in Kazakhstan. An important reason is that Kazakhstan is located between China and Russia, the two main US competitors. As Kazakhstan is a relatively newly independent country, the US believes its forces can help develop US influence quickly there. Kazakhstan's recent unrest is unanticipated. It was a very stable country. The reasons behind the turbulence are complicated, and domestic contradictions are likely to be the main reason. However, we can notice the role of West NGOs as well.When West media outlets cover the situation, they like to hype that Russia is consolidating its so-called sphere of influence and they accuse Russia of sending troops into Kazakhstan. However, the Russia military was deployed together with the CSTO Collective Peacekeeping Forces, following the principles of the CSTO and the request of Kazakh President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev. There is nothing wrong with Russia's act. The West accusations don't hold any legal ground.Kazakhstan will trend toward stability in the future. In addition to regional security issues, anti-terrorism and stopping the ""three evils,"" both China and Russia can play a large and positive role in Kazakhstan's reconstruction after this turbulence.The security of neighboring countries, especially the security along the BRI routes, is a part of China's overall security. This is also the case for Russia. In terms of the Ukraine issue, the dispute between Russia and NATO has already been fierce. Likewise, the tension in the Taiwan Straits has never eased. There is still a lot of room for China and Russia to continue to meet regional security challenges cooperatively.The article was compiled by Global Times reporter based on an interview with Li Xing, a professor of international relations at Beijing Normal University. opinion@globaltimes.com.cn",OPINION,VIEWPOINT,China Russia.

126,Can the US maintain balance in Eurasian region from a distance?,Wang Fan,2022-01-10,"Russia will hold three successive security dialogues with the US, NATO and Organization for Security and Cooperation in EU respectively starting from Monday.The core issue of the talks with the US and NATO is whether NATO should expand eastward. The two sides are at loggerheads with respect to this topic. NATO leaders say it has never promised not to expand eastward. For Russia, a representative move of NATO's eastward expansion is Ukraine's possible accession to NATO, which means that Ukraine will be included in the US-led military deployment system. That would allow the US to place offensive weapons, including strategic missiles, in the territory of any NATO member state such as Ukraine. This will make the security situation for Russia even more serious.There are two possible ways for Ukraine to join NATO: One is to join NATO without being a nominal member. There is a high possibility of forming a quasi-alliance based on arms sales and military exercises. The other is to fully join NATO in accordance with due procedures, the possibility of which is small at present.From a strategic perspective, there must be special considerations lying behind US's strong concerns about Ukraine affairs. The US' geopolitical goal is to turn Ukraine into a ""conundrum"" that will never be solved, or into an arena for great power rivalry. The US will not allow Russia to ""annex"" Ukraine because if Ukraine falls to Russia, the US will lose an important tool to check Russia and play a role in the regional situation.On the other hand, deterring Russia military action is also a priority for the US and NATO. The US needs to keep regional tensions without allowing relations to collapse and to escalate into a war. The US can no longer afford to engage in a large-scale war, especially with Russia, which is a nuclear power. So by warning of comprehensive economic sanctions against Russia ""if it invades Ukraine,"" the US wants to show its resolve and that it will not allow Russia to repeat its adventure in Crimea in 2014.From Moscow's point of view, however, resolving the Ukraine issue is no longer just a game between the two countries. Russia wants binding guarantees to prevent the eastward expansion of NATO and the deployment of offensive missile systems in its neighbor. Based on their respective positions, the US and Russia are indeed at loggerheads. Both the US and Russia are using mixed strategies to play games with each other, and there is little possibility of direct military conflicts or military conflicts by agents. The US uses the Ukraine issue to achieve several goals. First, to create war panic by vigorously engaging in brinkmanship. Second, let Ukraine act as a pawn to check and balance Russia. By nominally helping Ukraine, the US is actually making Ukraine work for the US. Third, form a situation in which the EU and Russia balance each other, while the US can play a leading or dictating role in the crisis. The US hopes to create ""collective anxiety"" among NATO allies around Russia and force them to deepen their security dependence on the US to curb EU's pursuit of strategic autonomy. Fourth, the Ukraine issue is used to deter Russia and increase US leverage in its dialogue with Russia.Russia President Vladimir Putin has two cards to play against the US. One is military intervention in Ukraine. This can be seen as Russia's response to the US' brinkmanship strategy. The other is military intervention in the Pacific to counterbalance the Indo-Pacific Strategy of the US.The US currently wants to tie Russia's main attention to the West Front, while keeping it distracted from the East. Only in this way can the effective implementation of its Indo-Pacific Strategy be ensured. It's certain the US is now not in a position to intervene directly with military forces. It is the US' fixated aim to use the crisis to maintain its dominance of the Eurasian center.Historically, when the US is in strategic contraction, it often tends to create crises in strategic areas of concern, so that its allies and adversaries can balance each other and the US can maintain balance to the greatest extent offshore. From this point of view, the Ukraine situation may become a long-term and strategic issue.The author is vice president of China Foreign Affairs University.

127,Court compensates families after airliner shot down in Iran,AFP,2022-01-04,"A Canada court has awarded more than CAN$100 million ($785,348) in compensation to the families of six people who died aboard a Ukraine passenger jet shot down over Tehran almost two years ago, local media said Monday. Iran shot down Ukraine International Airlines flight PS752 shortly after take-off from its capital Tehran on January 8, 2020, killing all 176 people aboard, including 85 Canada citizens and permanent residents.Three days later, the Iran armed forces admitted having shot down the Kiev-bound plane ""by mistake.""Ontario Superior Court Judge Edward Belobaba awarded the plaintiffs more than CAN$107 million, according to several media outlets, including the English-language channel CBC. In May, the same judge concluded that Iran had committed a ""terrorist"" act by shooting down the Ukraine aircraft, paving the way for a claim for compensation from the families of the victims. Tehran denounced that ruling, saying it had ""no basis"" and insisting that the Canada court lacked the authority to render such a decision.The plaintiffs had asked for CAN$1.5 billion in damages. In a final report in March, the Iran Civil Aviation Organization (CAO) said its air defense systems were on high alert for a US counter-attack after Tehran fired missiles at a military base in Iraq that was used by US forces. The Islamic republic had just attacked a US base in Iraq in response to the killing of General Qassem Soleimani, and were expecting a response from US.Ukraine denounced the report as a ""cynical attempt to hide the real causes"" of the tragedy, while Ottawa said the report was ""incomplete"" and lacked ""hard evidence.""",WORLD,AMERICAS,"People pay their respect during a candlelight vigil to honor victims of the Ukrainian passenger plane crash at Mel Lastman Square in Toronto, Canada, Jan. 9, 2020.

128,Joint statement by ‘P5’ countries restrains AUKUS practices,Wei Dongxu,2022-01-04,"Leaders of the five Nuclear-Weapon States, namely China, France, Russia, the UK and the US on Monday issued a joint statement on preventing nuclear war and avoiding arms races. This is the first time for leaders of the five nuclear-weapon states to issue such a joint statement.This statement by the five permanent members of the UN (known as the ""P5"") can be regarded as a gift of peace to the whole world. It conveys a clear signal that even if there are contradictions among the five countries, no nuclear war will be triggered. US sees Beijing as its top rival and engages in competition within all fields including that of the military. Additionally, the international community is worried about the possible scenario of military confrontation between Russia and the US over Ukraine. This joint statement can dispel the anxiety of the outside world. The five countries may sometimes vent anger toward each other because of their confrontations, but they will not press the nuclear button. This has certainly assured the world.China has always been advocating the idea that ""a nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought,"" and has been playing a leading role in promoting the five countries taking joint actions. Among the P5, China has always been prudent and rational toward nuclear issues and strived to contribute to nuclear arms control and prevent nuclear proliferation. Such a joint statement means China's approach and policy on nuclear weapons have been met with approval from the other four countries of the P5.The risks of nuclear proliferation still exist across the world. For example, the US, UK and Australia in September 2021 announced the formation of an enhanced trilateral security partnership called ""AUKUS,"" which will support Canberra in acquiring nuclear-powered submarines and enable nuclear-powered submarines to patrol the Indo-Pacific region. Some analysts said they were touching the bottom line of the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons.This joint statement by the P5 demonstrates that other countries, such as China, Russia and France, may have piled some pressure on the US against AUKUS, and urged US to take more responsibility.  The US seems to have made compromises in response.The joint statement will to some extent restrain the US' development of nuclear weapons, as well as its practices in spreading nuclear technology to its allies through small US-led cliques, such as the AUKUS. The statement by the P5 drew a red line on nuclear proliferation - nuclear weapons, as well as weapons-grade highly enriched uranium, will not spread.If the US breaks through certain contents or principles in this statement, it will face more queries and criticisms. In the future, US's arms sales will encounter increasing restraint and supervision from the other four P5 members. Corresponding supervision mechanisms will limit the US and the UK in providing Australia with nuclear-powered submarine technology. Against this backdrop, it remains to be seen whether Canberra can acquire nuclear-powered submarines or what kinds of limitations will be set for putting the submarines into use.However, US is good at saying one thing and doing another. Sometimes, the US takes good advantage of the loopholes within policies or plays conspiratorial tricks. For example, US President Joe Biden said that the US is ""not seeking a new cold war or a world divided into rigid blocs"" at the UN, yet almost at the same time, the AUKUS was established.Therefore, the possibility that US will take measures to evade restrictions on providing nuclear-powered submarines cannot be ruled out. China, Russia and other countries should keep a close eye on such issues and remain vigilant toward the US' intent.The author is a Beijing-based military analyst. opinion@globaltimes.com.cn",OPINION,VIEWPOINT,Illustration: Chen Xia/Global Times,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'States': ('MISC', 1), 'China': ('LOC', 5), 'France': ('LOC', 2), 'Russia': ('LOC', 3), 'UK': ('LOC', 2), 'US': ('LOC', 9), 'Beijing': ('LOC', 1), 'Ukraine': ('LOC', 1), 'Australia': ('LOC', 1), 'Canberra': ('LOC', 1), 'Indo - Pacific': ('LOC', 1), 'UN': ('ORG', 1), 'P5': ('ORG', 3), 'AUKUS': ('ORG', 1), 'AU': ('ORG', 2)}"
129,China shows global responsibility on nukes,Liu Xuanzun,2022-01-04," China had pushed forward a joint statement by the leaders of the five nuclear weapon states on preventing nuclear war and avoiding arms races issued on Monday by urging the others to join the reaffirmation that a nuclear war cannot be won and shall not be fought, after the process under the framework of the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) remained in a state of inaction for a couple of years and despite resistance from the former Donald Trump administration, a senior China diplomat said on Tuesday.As a good start to China's diplomacy in 2022, China's positive role in putting the five permanent members of the UN (P5) together in making the historic document showed the country's global responsibility on nukes, and its no-first-use and minimal deterrence nuclear policies are examples to other nuclear powers, experts said.In a briefing held by the Department of Arms Control at China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Tuesday, Fu Cong, Director General of the department, said that this is the first time that the leaders of the five nuclear weapon states - which also happen to be the P5 - had issued a joint statement on issues related to nuclear weapons, and the first time since 2000 after the Millennium Summit that the leaders of the P5 had issued a joint statement on any international issue.This demonstrates the significance of this historic document, Fu said.From China's perspective, the affirmation that ""a nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought"" is especially important, because this time around, it has been done collectively by the five under the current international situation, and this will go a long way toward alleviating China's concerns, particularly on the risk of nuclear war and in reducing tensions, Fu said.The joint statement comes at a time when international strategic security is facing many major challenges amid profound changes not seen in a century, including tensions in EU over the Ukraine issue involving Russia and the US, in the Asia-Pacific over the Taiwan question involving China and the US, as well as the effects of the pandemic, observers said.On whether the joint statement will help ease tensions in the Taiwan Straits, Fu said that it will be conducive, since the basic understanding of the true nature of nukes are that they are the ultimate deterrent and not for war. ""This applies everywhere.""Responsible major powerFu pointed out that the document was formulated within the P5 process, which is a process that was established under the framework of the NPT to coordinate nuclear issues. But for a couple of years, that process was in a state of inaction.In 2019, when China coordinated the process, it tried its best to revitalize it, Fu said, noting that since then, China has been urging the P5 to collectively reaffirm this important principle that a nuclear war cannot be won and shall not be fought.However, this met resistance from some countries. During that time, the Donald Trump administration was not interested in arms control issues, Fu said.But with President Joe Biden in office, the US decided to support the idea, Fu said, noting that Russia has been quite positive from the beginning with China, and the UK and France subsequently came on board.China played a very positive role in revitalizing the process and in pushing for the conclusion of the document, Fu said, noting that China is now pushing to expand the subject on the P5 process, so that the process could discuss not only nuclear issues, but also other issues related to strategic stability, including outer space, missile defense, AI and other emerging technologies.  The joint statement said that the five countries' leaders ""reiterate the validity of our previous statements on de-targeting and reaffirming that none of our nuclear weapons are targeted at each other or at any other state.""China Vice Foreign Minister Ma Zhaoxu told media on Monday that this paragraph was included thanks to China's push.Some foreign analysts questioned the effect of the joint statement, claiming that the P5 is doing the opposite in reality, as they are in an arms race and prepared for a nuclear war.Fu said that the joint statement is important in the sense that it is a confidence-building measure despite it being only a declaration, as it is expected to reduce the risk of an accidental or unauthorized launch of a nuclear weapon.China is not dramatically expanding its nuclear capabilities, since China maintains minimum nuclear capabilities required for national defense, Fu said, noting that China is modernizing its nuclear arsenal, only for reliability and safety issues.This is because the security environment has been changing as the US sees China as its biggest competitor, and it is using every means to contain China, including planning to spend trillions of dollars in the nuclear field, Fu said.The past few years have witnessed the suspension of a number of important arms control treaties because of the unilateral withdrawal by the US under Donald Trump. The five countries' leaders felt it necessary to reconfirm that they are committed to preserving and complying with arms control treaties, Fu said.The leaders also reaffirmed their commitment to prevent military conflict and to avoid an arms race in the current international tensions in EU and in the Asia-Pacific, Fu said.China's leading role in pushing forward with the joint statement displayed its responsibility as a major power in the world in maintaining global strategic stability, experts said.As one of the P5 and a major political and economic influencer, China's stance on nuclear weapons is of great importance to the world, Xu Guangyu, a China military expert, told the Global Times on Tuesday. China's commitment will calm the anxieties stirred by recent China-US tensions and regional hot issues surrounding China, Xu said.The statement shows China's responsible attitude, urging other countries not to abuse nuclear weapons and to contribute to safeguarding peace and stability, another China military expert told the Global Times on Tuesday, requesting anonymity.China's responsibility on nuclear issues is not only shown in the statement, but also in other processes like the Iran nuclear deal.Fu told the Global Times at the press briefing that as far as China's position is concerned with the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), people first need to have a clear understanding of the basic logic--that is, the reason why we are here today as the JCPOA is in the state of crisis because of the unilateral withdrawal by the US. So it is only natural that the US should take measures to lift its illegal sanctions. On that basis, Iran should return to its commitment.China urged all sides to show flexibility to accommodate the legitimate concerns of all sides, Fu said.China is playing a positive role, and that has been acknowledged by all sides, by Iran and by the US, Fu said. ""We have been pushing the two sides to be more forthcoming in the negotiations, in accommodating each other's concerns. We also have come up with concrete proposals and to move the negotiations forward.""China has also set an example for other nuclear-capable countries with its no-first-use and minimum deterrence nuclear policies, as the others should also have a wise and careful view on the deployment and use of nukes, experts said.

130,"China leads in five-state joint statement on preventing nuclear war, arms race",Liu Xuanzun,2022-01-03," For the first time, the leaders of China, France, Russia, the UK and the US on Monday issued a joint statement on preventing nuclear war and avoiding arms races, in which China played a powerful leading role, and pushed for the reaffirmation of not aiming nuclear devices at each other or at any other state.The joint statement by the five Nuclear-Weapon States - also the five UN permanent members - will set the mind of the international community at ease at a time when the international strategic security is facing many major challenges, China experts said on Monday.According to the joint statement, the five countries consider the avoidance of war between Nuclear-Weapon States and the reduction of strategic risks as their foremost responsibilities, and they affirm that a nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought, the Xinhua News Agency reported on Monday.The five countries' leaders affirm that nuclear weapons - for as long as they continue to exist - should serve defensive purposes, deter aggression and prevent war, the joint statement said, noting that they also believe strongly that the further spread of such weapons must be prevented, and they remain committed to Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty obligations, including pursuing negotiations on measures relating to the cessation of the nuclear arms race at an early date and to nuclear disarmament.""We reiterate the validity of our previous statements on de-targeting, reaffirming that none of our nuclear weapons are targeted at each other or at any other State,"" the joint statement reads.Introducing the significance of the joint statement, China's Vice Foreign Minister Ma Zhaoxu told media on Monday that this is the first time the leaders of the five countries have issued a statement over the nuclear weapon issue.This reflects the five countries' political will of preventing nuclear war and their common voice on safeguarding global strategic stability and reducing risks of a nuclear conflict, at a time when international strategic security is facing many major challenges amid profound changes not seen in a century as well as the pandemic, Ma said.Song Zhongping, a China military expert and TV commentator, told the Global Times on Monday that the world today is not peaceful. For example, the current issue over Ukraine could risk a nuclear war between the US and Russia, and that is why US President Joe Biden said nuclear war must not start in his recent phone call with Russia President Vladimir Putin.The US is reportedly developing low-yield nuclear weapons and lowing the threshold of using nuclear weapons in real combat, observers said.The joint statement is good news for the world, and it will set the mind of the international community at ease, Song said.Ma revealed that China played a powerful leading role in the five countries' joint efforts, and in the discussion of the joint statement, China pushed to include key content including the reaffirming of not aiming nuclear devices at each other or at any other state.China always maintains a nuclear strategic self-defensive in nature, upholds a nuclear policy of no-first-use, and keeps its nuclear strength at a minimum level to safeguard national security, Ma stressed. ""This in itself is an important contribution to global strategic stability.""Song said this displays China's responsibility as a major power and dismissed foreign media's recent hype over China's nuclear development.",CHINA,DIPLOMACY,DF-41 Photo: VCG,"Reporter, Beijing",Defense reporter at the Global Times covering weapons and military development.,"{'China': ('LOC', 5), 'France': ('LOC', 1), 'Russia': ('LOC', 3), 'UK': ('LOC', 1), 'US': ('LOC', 4), 'Ukraine': ('LOC', 1), 'Nuclear': ('MISC', 2), 'States': ('MISC', 2), 'Nuclear Non - Proliferation Treaty': ('MISC', 3), 'UN': ('ORG', 1), 'Xinhua News Agency': ('ORG', 1), 'Ma Zhaoxu': ('PER', 2), 'Song Zhong': ('PER', 1), 'Joe B': ('PER', 1), 'Vladimir Putin': ('PER', 1)}"
131,"By fueling anti-Chinese, anti-Russian sentiments, NATO may set world on fire: Russian scholar",Li Qingqing,2021-12-30,"Editor's Note: The US hasn't stopped its attempt to unite allies and contain China and Russia. As 2021 comes to an end, how will the relationship between China, Russia and the US develop and will there be another Black Swan event? Facing West containment, in what areas can the China-Russia relationship deepen? Andrey Bystritskiy (Bystritskiy), chairman of the Board of the Foundation for Development and Support of the Valdai Discussion Club, a Moscow-based think tank and discussion forum, shared his thoughts with Global Times (Global Times) reporter Li Qingqing on these issues.Global Times:  In what field do you think a Black Swan event is most likely to occur in 2022? Is it in the relations among major powers, economic events caused by COVID-19 pandemic, or a small event that triggers an overall impact?Bystritskiy: Unfortunately, anything can happen, from the escalation of the pandemic due to the emergence of new strains, to natural disasters. Even an alien invasion is possible, although it is not so likely to happen. The most dangerous, however, is the escalation of conflicts between countries. These conflicts can happen in many forms, from economic struggles to cyber attacks, armed conflicts between armies managed by private military companies, and even simply terrorist organizations. Unfortunately, the elites in many countries often treat the global situation irresponsibly and take unnecessary risks. This is the case even in countries that seem to be completely civilized, such as in EU.Global Times: What are Russia's expectations for its relations with China and the US in the future?Bystritskiy: In my opinion, relations between Russia and China are developing in the right direction. They can become a model for relations between countries. In a sense, stable, peaceful, equal and mutually beneficial relations stimulate the development of our countries, Eurasia and even the whole world. The development of Russia-China relations is an important element of the security system needed by everyone on our planet. The conversations between Russia and China leaders and the US president are helpful. It is at least some kind of dialogue and it is better than nothing. However, holding talks alone is not enough. The US elites are split and it is very difficult to hope that they will behave constructively. The best that can be expected is the establishment of some kind of ""truce"" or the creation of a system of relations where everyone can live on their own without disturbing each other. There are hints that it is possible to create such a system of world order but we should not be too optimistic.Global Times: Recently, many West media outlets have hyped that China and Russia would launch simultaneous military operations against Taiwan island and Ukraine, claiming that this will pose a threat to the US-led international order. What do you think of such concentrated attack against China and Russia?Bystritskiy: A media blitz on our countries in the West media has, alas, become the norm. In general, they reflect the unstable situation in West countries. Attacks on Russia and China help maintain the sprawling unity among West countries and attach importance to NATO's existence. The problem is that West countries, and above all the US, have lost their leadership and are unable to maintain the previous world order. Hence, they now have a desperate desire to manipulate public opinion. They say, ""There are threats from Russia and China, so let's take action."" But it seems that they do not believe in themselves. Moreover, there is growing internal criticism of this position in NATO countries. However, the situation is dangerous. By inflaming anti-China and anti-Russia sentiments, NATO countries risk accidentally setting the whole world on fire.Global Times: In an interview with the Global Times this month, historian Paul Kennedy said the current close China-Russia relations are a ""temporary convenience alliance."" His views are representative in the West. How do you view such a misunderstanding? Under the continuous West containment, in what areas will the China-Russia relationship deepen?Bystitskiy: Many people are trying to pass the desirable as reality. It is difficult for the West elites to accept that countries like China and Russia can actually manage without them and live on their own. I think the center of world development is shifting to Asia and this means that Asia countries will cooperate. There are the deepest reasons for this cooperation because the sustainable development of the entire macro-region is impossible without some kind of integration. Russia and China, as I mentioned before, provide an example of such cooperation. It is based not on West pressure, but on fundamental processes in Asia, a continent that is the largest part of the world in terms of territory, population and natural resources. Russia and China can constructively cooperate in practically all spheres: from defense to science, from education to the fight against climate change. And I want to note that there are areas where cooperation needs to be strengthened, above all, in the field of information. We need to get to know each other better.Global Times: This year marks the 30th anniversary of the disintegration of the Soviet Union. President Vladimir Putin once said that the fall of the Soviet Union was ""a major geopolitical catastrophe of the 20th century."" Is there still controversy in Russia society about the Soviet Union's choice at that time?Bystritskiy: The Russia society is certainly still going through the disintegration of the Soviet Union. Older generations still remember the Soviet Union with all its merits and demerits, while younger generations rather dream more about the future. I have seen something similar in China too. For example, Liu Cixin, the author of the sci-fi novel Three-Body Problem, gladly describes the grandiosity of the Soviet Union and its science. How true are these notions? That is the big question. The problem, though, is that Russia are constantly being reminded of the past. The disintegration of the Soviet Union divided the Russia people, many of which now live in neighboring countries. In some cases, these people are discriminated and their rights are violated. For example, there is actually a civil war in Ukraine. However, it is not very intense so far.Global Times: Many people compare the current competition between China and the US with the US-Soviet Union Cold War. How do you view the China-US competition and what do you think the final result will be?Bystritskiy: I would not compare the Cold War with today's competition between China and the US. Back then there was a real ideological competition. The Soviet Union offered its model about the achievements of people's wellbeing and happiness, and the US offered its own. On the one hand, today we are living in a very integrated world - for example, in terms of information. But on the other hand, we are also living in a very divided world, with different value systems and approaches to development.Ideologically, China and the US are not enemies but the US elites are worried about their exclusive position. They are also afraid of losing leverage on the global markets and the global situation as a whole. The current competition between China and the US could have many outcomes. We cannot rule out the most radical options including a direct conflict. Nevertheless, I hope that reason will prevail and the new generations of politicians will find ways to coexist that are more or less rational.

134,US making calculating move in dangerous game of Ukraine crisis: Global Times editorial,Global Times,2021-12-28," US Vice President Kamala Harris said on Sunday that in the face of the current situation on the Ukraine border, the US will work with its allies and prepare to ""issue sanctions like you've not seen before."" The US and Russia have already blamed each other for the situation in Ukraine. The US claimed that Russia's military exercises near Ukraine's borders could be a prelude to an ""invasion"" of Ukraine, while Russia said it has the right to move troops on its own territory and demanded a pledge that NATO would not deploy its forces into Ukraine.The US and EU have been confronting Russia over Ukraine for some time. US intelligence claimed that Russia could ""invade Ukraine"" as soon as early 2022, while Russia President Vladimir Putin accused NATO of planning to deploy missile systems in Ukraine that could strike Moscow within minutes. Now, the clash between the two sides is getting even fiercer. Public opinion generally thinks that war is unlikely to break out between the US and Russia now. Mired in issues such as COVID-19 epidemic, inflation and the upcoming midterm elections, and US withdrew its troops from Afghanistan despite all the difficulties, now it has neither the will nor the energy to get involved in another war.But the US is continuously escalating tensions in Eastern Ukraine. Since the beginning of this year, the US has sent strategic bombers, including B-52s and B-1Bs to approach areas such as Black Sea. In November, the US sent strategic bombers and conducted simulated nuclear strikes against Russia, and entered airspace 20 kilometers away from Russia border, in an obviously provocative move. In addition, US released information such as it would impose economic sanctions on Russia and deploy more troops in EU to pile on maximum pressure. It is like throwing matches onto dry firewood from time to time, but avoiding the flames deliberately. To the US, the more tense the Ukraine situation becomes, the more EU countries will depend on the US. Setting up a common enemy among NATO is conducive to uniting allies. US is the biggest beneficiary of this dangerous game.And the biggest loser will be Ukraine, a country that has been in turmoil and division. US has painted its geopolitical competition between great powers with a thick layer of ideology. It has tried to portray what is happening on the Russia-Ukraine border as a tragic story about ""aggression"" and ""counter-aggression,"" as well as making Ukraine a pawn on the EU chessboard as it pushes eastward. Since the disintegration of the Soviet Union, many countries, including Ukraine, have experienced ""color revolutions"" supported by the US. But most of these countries ended up in tragedy, as the US has neither the will nor the ability to provide them with substantial assistance. The US has been providing huge military aid to Ukraine over the years, weaponizing it from top to toe. However, it has explicitly excluded any possibility of fighting for Ukraine. US's policy of creating crises is likely to turn Ukraine into a regional powder keg.The US is unreliable. This is true when it comes to not only Ukraine, but also Russia. The essence of the issue is not that US is ""seeking justice"" for Ukraine or EU, but that it is using NATO as a tool to cannibalize and squeeze Russia's strategic space. Since the end of the Cold War, Russia had also tried to win acceptance from the US and the West through making political changes. But what it gained is the US' abandonment of its promise that NATO would not expand eastward if a reunified Germany remained in the bloc. The US has led NATO to engage in five rounds of eastward expansion over the past more than two decades. Moscow sees Ukraine as a red line for security. But now even Ukraine is said to be absorbed into NATO. Russia President Vladmir Vladimir Putin on December 23 accused NATO of cheating Russia at his annual press conference. To secure its advantageous position by creating disputes, divisions, conflicts and confrontations is what US has always pursued in international affairs. Be it deploying missiles on Russia's doorstep, conducting ""close-in reconnaissance"" on China's coastal areas, or sending warships to sail through the Taiwan Straits, all these actions were taken by US to test its two biggest ""rivals"" and the US is waiting and looking for opportunities to drive a wedge. The US may not plan to start a war with Russia or China, but it hopes to maintain a certain degree of tension and chaos in the surrounding areas of the two opponents. As such, it has kept propagating the ""China threat theory"" and ""Russia threat theory"" and at the same time tries to rally allies to exert pressure together in an attempt to force Russia and China to retreat from their core interests. What is happening in EU today has taught the China people a good lesson. That is, the US has never changed its foreign policy of profiting from regional tensions. China won't bend to US pressure in exchange for an environment of peaceful development. China must unswervingly move forward based on our own pace and during this process, change the US intention to pressure China from a position of strength. This is the most important rule for China as a major power to get along with the US.",OPINION,EDITORIAL,"Russian President Vladimir Putin speaks during his annual press conference at the Moscow Manege on December 23, 2021.

135,"Putin lambasts West, endorses strong ties with China at yearend press conference",Global Times,2021-12-23,"In his yearend press conference, Russia President Vladimir Putin lambasted the West's brazen lies and stressed the country was forced to make tough decisions as it has no space for concessions amid soaring tensions with the West over Ukraine, which have sparked fears of an all-out war. Asked by a SkyNews correspondent what guarantee Russia can provide that it would not attack Ukraine or any other sovereign state, the Russia leader said that it was not Russia that created threats to other countries, TASS reported.""Have we approached the borders of the US or UK? They have approached ours. And now they say 'Ukraine will be a NATO member,' "" he explained.""You are demanding some guarantees from me. But it is you that must provide guarantees. You must do that at once, now, and not keep talking about this for decades,"" Vladimir Putin said.Many China people admire Vladimir Putin's courage to defend the national interests of Russia, since US military forces have also approached regions like the China Sea and Taiwan Straits to threaten China's sovereignty and security, and many web users hope China could be as tough as Russia against the US. However, Russia-style diplomacy and military action against West pressure are unique and China has its own way of handling the challenge, said China experts, adding that the tensions in EU around Russia's border regions are much more serious, because they're too close to Russia's capital, and Russia has no room to compromise and no choice but to be tough and straight. ""Vladimir Putin and his country were being very sincere and friendly to the West in the 1990s and Russia have tried everything to improve ties with the West. But eventually, they found that the US and the West world don't want to have good ties with them. All the West wants to do is to keep weakening Russia, profit from the collapse of the Soviet Union, until Russia lose hope to be a major power forever,"" said a Beijing-based expert on international relations who asked not to be named. He said, ""Vladimir Putin and Russia's unhappy experiences with the West just told many of US a lesson - that the problems we have with the West are never about ideology, culture or human rights…They're always about power. If you are a 'nobody' with no influence and unable to say no to them, the West wouldn't care about what you do in your countries. But if you are able to balance their hegemony and fend off their invasions and bullying, then you will become evil in their propaganda.""Russia said earlier it wanted a legally binding guarantee that NATO would give up any military activity in EU and Ukraine, part of a wish list of security guarantees it wants to negotiate with the West, Reuters reported. It is the first time that Moscow laid out in detail demands that it says are essential for lowering tensions in EU and defusing a crisis over Ukraine.Yang Jin, an associate research fellow at the Institute of Russia, EU and Central Asia Studies at the China Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times that facing questions from hundreds of journalists, Vladimir Putin has always showed a sharp and tough stance against the West as he is dedicated to safeguarding Russia's sovereignty and national interests by drawing clear redlines. This is similar to China, when it comes to questions on China's core interests such as the Taiwan question, Yang noted.  Despite the fierce response to the US and NATO, Vladimir Putin also showed his soft persona and firm commitment to solving domestic issues. He also mentioned China many times, stressing Russia and China trust each other and their cooperation is a stabilizing factor in the international arena.""It's an absolutely comprehensive partnership of a strategic nature that hasn't had precedents in history, at least between Russia and China,"" he said during his annual news conference. ""This hard day-to-day work benefits China and Russia people and is a serious stabilizing factor on the international stage.""Vladimir Putin also stressed he has always been against the politicization of sports, noting that the US ""boycott"" aims to curb China's development. ""This decision is unacceptable and erroneous. I spoke with a former US president, and he told me that the boycotts of the Olympics in Los Angeles and Moscow were a big mistake, made by the US as well. But the US continues to make the very same mistake. What caused that? It is an attempt to curb China's growth,"" the president stated.China experts noted Vladimir Putin spoke highly of the country's cooperation with China in his press conference and showed the West how unshakable China and Russia relations are. Vladimir Putin said, ""They (the US) cannot hold back the development of China. The China economy is already larger than the US economy in terms of purchasing power parity. China will inevitably become the world's top economy in all respects. But you have to understand this.""",CHINA,DIPLOMACY,"Russian President Vladimir Putin speaks during his annual press conference at the Moscow Manege on December 23, 2021.

136,Globalism under US leadership turns into a machine that destroys humanity: Russian scholar,Global Times,2021-12-23,"Editor's Note: As tensions at the Ukraine border escalate, many in the West continue to play up the crises in Ukraine and the Taiwan Straits, claiming both are under threat of ""military attacks"" from either Russia or the China mainland. How should Beijing and Moscow respond to a smear campaign from the West? What is the future of the China-Russia partnership? Russia political scientist Vladimir Pavlenko (Pavlenko), who is also a columnist for Russia news agency REGNUM and research fellow at the Moscow-based independent public scientific organization Academy of Geopolitical Problems, discussed these issues with Global Times (Global Times) reporter Xia Wenxin.Global Times: What do you think of the recent ""Summit for Democracy"" that was clearly against China and Russia? Did the US achieve its goal?Pavlenko: It is too early to say whether Joe Biden succeeded or not. On one hand, he attempted to artificially divide the international community into those who are loyal to US and those who oppose it. This harms the credibility of the UN (UN) for not being able to prevent such a division.On the other hand, the summit contributed to a further rapprochement between Moscow and Beijing which is strengthening our position in the world. Russia and China can attract those who disagree with the attempts by the US to maintain its hegemony at the expense of the UN. There is also the factor of uncertainty in US domestic affairs. Mid-term elections will be held in less than a year and if the Democrats lose the majority in both or in one of the chambers of the US Congress, the whole structure that Joe Biden is building based on the ""Summit for Democracy"" may stagger.Global Times: After the Summit, will the ""democracy"" card the US has been playing still be effective?Pavlenko: The weakness of US democracy was clearly manifested in the massive crisis after the 2020 US presidential election. The Capitol riots that happened on January 6, 2021, prove there are very serious contradictions in US society that seem to be more and more like a steam boiler with a closed lid.Under the erosion of the ""world hegemon,"" Russia and China enjoy one main achievement. They have clearly demonstrated to people all over the world an alternative path of development that is based on equal relations and excludes the dictates from the strong ones. The rapprochement between Moscow and Beijing also strengthens the world's shaken strategic stability. This is very important amid the tremendous changes that are taking place on our planet.The recent summit showed that the only thing the US can offer to its satellite countries is financial handouts, including Joe Biden's $424.2 million Presidential Initiative for Democratic Renewal. This is how the US encourages participants to show up at the second summit and undermine the UN. Moreover, the US is trying to exclude any issue that cannot be taken under US control from the global agenda. Russia and China need to strengthen their opposition to this policy and have an active discussion. Also, both countries need to show that there is no ""universal"" interpretation of human rights and it is a tool of US hegemony. Each country is entitled to its own agenda on human rights and does not have to report to US about it.Global Times: Many West media outlets have recently claimed that China and Russia are simultaneously launching military operations against the island of Taiwan and Ukraine, and that they pose a threat to the US-led international order. What do you think of this smear campaign from the West against China and Russia?Pavlenko: Both the island of Taiwan and Ukraine received an invitation from Joe Biden to the ""Summit for Democracy."" This means that there is a completely different scenario under the guise of demagogy about the alleged ""military preparations"" of Russia and China against Ukraine and Taiwan island. The US expects to permanently tear Ukraine away from Russia by dragging it into NATO, and refuses the recognition of the one-China principle. Neither Russia nor China is planning any ""military solution"" to the issue of Ukraine or the Taiwan question. Joe Biden's speculation on these topics suggests that US may well be preparing major political and even military provocations and then put the blame on China and Russia. For the US it is not important at all if Ukraine and Taiwan island suffer in that case. For US, they are expendable material. Therefore, despite the slanderous nature of the US propaganda campaign, Moscow and Beijing should not let their guard down in any way.Global Times: There is an opinion, especially in the West, that the current relationship between China and Russia is only a temporary alliance of convenience. What is your take on that? In what direction will the China-Russia partnership deepen in the face of constant harassment from the West?Pavlenko: The Russia-China partnership is the union of the two most powerful states and peoples in Eurasia that prevents our great continent from becoming a bridgehead for US global domination. History shows that the external threat to the Eurasian peoples yields to greater stability and balance when Russia and China act together. The US has learned very serious lessons from our countries' joint international assistance to the heroic Korean people, who were subjected to US intervention in the 1950s. After falling back from the Korean Peninsula, the US made all of its efforts to sever our partnership for its own benefit.Moscow and Beijing have also learned necessary lessons from the 20th century. The current rapprochement between Russia and China led by our leaders is not situational but strategic and future-oriented. The greater the threat posed by the policy of US hegemony, the more solid forms of economic, political, and military cooperation our two countries will need to repulse external threats. Our countries, peoples, and armed forces are ready for this.Global Times: Many people compare the competition between the US and China to the Cold War between the US and the Soviet Union. How do you evaluate the current China-US competition? How will it end, in your opinion?Pavlenko: The most important common feature of the Soviet Union-US and China-US confrontation is that rising socialism offers a new, more attractive model of the future to the world than capitalism. The latter has had its day. It is dying out but still clinging to power to rule the world and try to stop the ""wheel of history.""In the era of digitalization, capitalism does not need people. A robot is more profitable for capitalists. It does not get sick, need social security or a pension or ask for a pay raise. The meaning of globalism does not lie in beautiful slogans like ""one humanity."" It is about transforming the present world made up by countries into a world of corporations.We need to understand that capitalism was once reborn as imperialism and now it is malignantly taking on a new life as ""globalism."" And the main instrument to counter this is not a game of ""universal"" values but a clear statement about the content of scientific and technological progress. What are the interests behind this progress? The interests of the privileged minority or the absolute majority? This, in my opinion, is the main question of our time.Globalism under the leadership of the US has turned into a machine that destroys humanity. And to defeat it, it is necessary to provide the world with a clear alternative program. This also aims to allow everyone see two things. First, the US is calling for a world serving a minority. In other words, it is calling for the division of humanity into the ""superior"" and the ""inferior"" through technology innovation. Second, there is the alternative to change these innovations for the common good. I am sure that this is beyond the power of capitalism and only socialism can achieve this.It would be right for China to lay stress on the new model of development as well as clearly and distinctly explain to the world that a ""shared future"" is not only about material benefits. It can also lead to other higher, more harmonious spiritual state for mankind. Capitalism kills people's dreams and turns them into complete cynics. The task of socialism is to revive people's dreams. Then, people will be able to move mountains.",OPINION,VIEWPOINT,A circus in town Illustration: Liu Rui/GT,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'Ukraine': ('LOC', 2), 'West': ('LOC', 2), 'Taiwan Straits': ('LOC', 1), 'Russia': ('LOC', 7), 'China': ('LOC', 5), 'Beijing': ('LOC', 3), 'Moscow': ('LOC', 4), 'US': ('LOC', 9), 'Vladimir Pavlenko': ('PER', 3), 'Xia Wenxin': ('PER', 1), 'Joe Biden': ('PER', 2), 'Pa': ('PER', 1), 'REGNUM': ('ORG', 1), 'Academy of Geotical Problems': ('ORG', 1), 'Global Times': ('ORG', 4), 'UN': ('ORG', 3), 'Congress': ('ORG', 1), 'Summit for Democracy': ('MISC', 3), 'Democrats': ('MISC', 1)}"
137,GT investigates:  Why American institutes stigmatize Chinese students who defend reputation of motherland?,GT staff reporters,2021-12-23,"Purdue University President Mitch Daniels' open letter to all students on December 15, in which he condemned China students for ""harassment"" and ""threats"" allegedly made against students who criticize China, has caused a huge outcry and backlash on campuses across the US, as China students expressed their indignation toward the lies of anti-China forces in the US, and that those who defend the truth and the dignity of China were mischaracterized as bullies.The controversial incident stemmed from a revelation that China PhD candidate Kong Zhihao at Purdue University made repeated statements attacking his country, including supporting the riots orchestrated by Hong Kong secessionists and arguing that China's Taiwan region is a sovereign state.""At our school, China students are outraged to hear Kong's slander. Some of our compatriots were seeking legitimate ways to expose his hypocrisy, but not to attack him out of line,"" Sophia Zhao (pseudonym), a senior undergraduate student majors in communication at Purdue University, told the Global Times.Zhao said she saw through the incident to the deep malice of the US toward China students. ""The Purdue president came to believe, only listend to what the media say, that Kong had been persecuted, and even slapped all China students with a 'collusion with foreign governments in repression' charge,'"" she said.However, the students' peaceful means of correcting Kong's erroneous remarks were deemed ""attacks"" by the Purdue president.Liu Pengyu, spokesperson of the China Embassy in the US, said on December 18 that Purdue University's allegations against its China students are unfounded and that such allegations pose a threat to the reputation and safety of the China student community.Kong, currently has desperately shared his email around in various interviews, waiting for more anti-China activists to extend an olive branch to him.Experts and observers reached by the Global Times said that Kong's words and actions must have been influenced by the environment where he studied and lived in the US. Currently, the US is seeking every possible way to contain China, with more China students becoming the targets of influence to oppose China, experts said.""These people are the defective products of US education system. Their being able to 'have an audience' shows a sick social environment in the US,"" Li Haidong, a professor at the Institute of International Relations at China Foreign Affairs University, told the Global Times.Open infiltration""People with ulterior motives are everywhere in the US,"" Zhao said, noting that on campus, many anti-China clubs have set up China-related topics with ulterior motives to brainwash students and recruit like-minded people.According to Zhao, these groups usually use sensational pictures and provocative titles to attract curious foreigners and China students.""The initial meeting may seem professional because they invite one or two scholars for a brief objective discussion. If you are interested in attending their upcoming events, then you may be treated to a series of elaborate anti-China documentaries produced by West media outlets that will make you question your understanding of China,"" Zhao noted.These people are also quick to become ""close friends"" to those they want to brainwash, pretending to care for their lives while subliminally influencing them with their distorted values, Zhao said. ""Then, when it comes to some issues, they will pull you in, in the name of a 'joint advance and retreat' to make a statement or even launch some protests,"" she said. A 2017 article titled How Spy Agencies Use US Universities to Secretly Recruit Students revealed that, US intelligence agencies develop sources among international student faculties and send them home as US operatives. In a poll of staff at US universities who work with international students, ""31 percent reported the FBI had visited students within the past year,"" wrote the article authored by US journalist and writer Daniel Golden.In addition to this infiltration into the ivory tower of US academia, the Global Times found that the US government is even using money to offensively infiltrate the students in China and the US.In May, for example, the US embassy and consulates in China released its Mission China Public Affairs Section (PAS) Annual Program Statement on its website. The program aims to support individuals, NGOs, think tanks, and academic institutions in China to organize events that ""provide a framework for US businesses to share US values, including but not limited to specific corporate social responsibility activities in partnership or within China communities."" With bounties of up to $30,000, areas where exchanges take place include expanding access for persons with disabilities, women's empowerment, LGBTQI rights, and the preservation of minority cultures, which have long been highly politicized topics in the US.

Photo: VCG At the same time, observers pointed out that China students with relatively special upbringings, identities, or religious beliefs are more likely to be the focus of cultivation by anti-China forces, because these students are more topical for the West. A student from one of China's ethnic minority groups also shared his experience. Once, while on campus at an US university, he came across a high-school classmate from Beijing.""I know that her family member was involved in some political crimes in China and she was supported by some overseas NGOs with political affiliations, even anti-China backgrounds, to study in the US,"" the student, who asked for anonymity, said. ""It is a 'secret' we [students from the high school] all know.""The information of China students studying overseas is easy for US agencies to attain, as it is filled in the documents provided upon entry into the US. Another China student who studied in California for three years told the Global Times that because of her Christian belief, various small local churches often tried to tempt her into memberships while she was in school, and after inviting her to events, they organized discussions and tried their best to smear China in front of her. Some of them receive bribes from certain organizations and serve as anti-China tools, Li said, adding that there are also certain people who wish to obtain permission to remain in the US after graduation through smearing their home country, Li said.Being infiltrated through whatever means, such as cash incentives or emotional blackmail, these students develop a delusion of self-importance, but in actuality, they are under others' control, Li said. ""Because usually these people do not have much experience and understanding about the society and their values are relatively easy to shake.""Purposeful deploymentThe US' work to influence foreign students with decided political intentions has been a consistent effort that has directly and indirectly led to color revolutions sweeping across EU and the Arab world, causing social instability.According to Russia media reports, the Russia government in 2014 discovered that some US NGOs supporting the Secondary School Student Program were registered as NGOs in Russia with funding from the US Councils for International Education. Russia then designated these organizations as foreign government agents and terminated the program.Since 1992, about 22,000 Russia students have participated in the program. None of them remained in the US, but returned to Russia. Some became prominent journalists, university lecturers, opinion leaders, and members of ""human rights"" and environmental groups.US values and its way of life are imprinted on these people's minds, and as a result, they often actively promote their experiences from the US. In this way, the US effectively creates an ""alternative elite"" in other countries, analysts said.In Egypt, even though some NGOs look legitimate, whenever the country experiences turmoil, they take advantage of the situation to stir up trouble.A leader of Egypt's April 6 Youth Movement, an anti-government activist, was invited to New York for the International Coordination Meeting of Youth Organizations in 2008, where he admitted later in a documentary that he had undergone an ""internship"" and was familiar with how to cope with police violence.And countries such as Georgia, Ukraine and Kyrgyzstan have showed that some of the young people, after having studied in and being influenced by the US, became the detonators of color revolutions in their countries, Li said. 

Ukraine anti-government protesters burn tires at a site of clashes with riot police in Kiev on January 25, 2014.Photo:VCGMany historical records show that the US' actions to politically infiltrate other countries and thereby plunge them into chaos are not uncommon but are very purposeful and systematic, Wang said. ""US capitalism is inseparable from its large intelligence support web. The US is a veteran in the area of peaceful evolution. With a quick glance, they can identify the right targets and focus on cultivating and consciously guiding them.""""The penetration process is covert and slow. When these young people realize that they are being used and are on the wrong path, it would have already caused irretrievable damage,"" Li said.Shameful US double standardsWhile the US itself has openly made transformed NGOs and other organizations into tools and platforms for exporting US value, and staging of color revolutions, it is also obsessed with stigmatizing normal academic and humanistic exchanges on the China side as infiltration, interference, and even espionage.In recent years, the US has made a habit of suppressing China students for no legitimate reason, with 3,000 to 5,000 China students being denied visas to the US each year for their under and graduate learning, accounting for 16 to 27 percent of the total, according to the China Foreign Ministry. Even China students who are granted visas are often overly scrutinized by customs, and have their electronic devices confiscated or even themselves deported.Zhao pointed out that in the US, China students are the best-behaved, most hardworking, and united students. ""We are incredibly disciplined on campus. Although we sometimes seem to be a little bit tightly-nit, we rarely do anything particularly out of the ordinary.""As for the alleged bullying, ""a proper response to rumors and slander is a decision most China people will have to make. We love our motherland,"" Zhao responded.The act of defending the motherland is not an act of suppression of other students. It is a matter of right or wrong.

138,"US’ hyperbolic China, Russia, Iran statements show outdated foreign policy",Andrey Kortunov,2021-12-22,"Last week, CNBC published an op-ed piece by Frederick Kempe, President and CEO of the US Atlantic Council. The author, a prominent US analyst and journalist, argues that in 2022 the US will have to focus on confronting the challenges coming from China, Russia and Iran. He suggests that these three nations will likely try to make use of the perceived US foreign policy weakness, which the recent US withdrawal from Afghanistan demonstrated in the most explicit way. Frederick Kempe also suggests that there is an intrinsic interconnection between the challenges of China's revisionism, Russia's adventurism, and Iran nuclear ambitions. However, in his view, all the three strategic adversaries of the US remain fragile and inherently deficient; therefore, their geopolitical offensive can and should be stopped and rolled back.This narrative is rather common in US these days; many mainstream politicians and respectful US scholars would probably subscribe to it. It might be appealing since it reduces the complexities of the world to a simple and understandable vision of an emerging new bipolarity. Still, there are a number of essential questions that this narrative fails to address. First, generalizations about yet another ""axis of evil"" confronting the Shining City on the Hill are always risky and often misleading. To put the Russia and China challenges to the US into one basket is like mixing apples and oranges. Russia's challenge is almost exclusively military and geopolitical - ranging from the strategic nuclear arms race to Moscow's direct or indirect military engagement in places like Syria, Ukraine or Libya. China's challenge is mostly economic and technological - from advanced machine building, to the competition in artificial intelligence. As for the Iran nuclear program, this is a problem that was created by the US itself, when US decided to unilaterally withdraw from JCPOA in May of 2018.Second, the intensifying geopolitical competition in the modern world, as real as it may be, cannot overshadow many global problems that are common for the US and its strategic adversaries. How could the world cope with issues of international terrorism, transborder migrations, climate change and the like, if relations between the US on the one hand, and China and Russia on the other, are perceived as a zero-sum game?  No reliable security architecture in EU can be built and sustained without Russia's participation. No robust economic ecosystem in the Asia-Pacific region could function without China's engagement. Third, the fundamental challenge to the US comes from within, not from without. The country badly needs a major upgrade to its infrastructure, education and public health systems. The US budget deficits and the national debt go through the roof. Inflation is higher than it was at any point in this century. The public trust in state institutions remains low, and the approval ratings of the Joe Biden administration are not high either. More importantly, a year after the national election of 2020, US society remains deeply divided on some of the most important questions of national development. This unfortunate situation has direct implications for the US international standing: a disunited US simply cannot pursue a consistent long-term foreign policy that both US proponents and opponents overseas could accept and respect. No foreign adversary is in a position to harm the US as much as it can harm itself. Moreover, in the 21st century, the emphasis on adversaries seems to be an obsolete foreign policy concept. A smart foreign policy has to focus on international problems rather than on foreign adversaries. Russia might be a part of the problem for the US in Ukraine, but is likely to be part of the solution for the US in the Arctic region. China is going to be a formidable competitor for US in manufacturing, but it is likely to remain a US strategic partner and customer in the energy sector. Countries like Turkey, India or even Germany and France can be a critically important allies in some areas, while remaining committed rivals in others. The problem-based approach to international affairs has to be mustered by all players of global politics, but the US, as one of the leading nations in the world, has a special responsibility in applying this approach to its foreign policy. It would give US a degree of flexibility that the old adversary-based approach hopelessly lacks. The author is director general of the Russia International Affairs Council. opinion@globaltimes.com.cn",OPINION,COLUMNISTS,Photo: VCG,Author title not found,"Andrey Kortunov, academic director of the Russian International Affairs Council.","{'CNBC': ('ORG', 1), 'US Atlantic Council': ('ORG', 1), 'JCPOA': ('ORG', 1), 'EU': ('ORG', 1), 'Frederick Kempe': ('PER', 2), 'US': ('LOC', 12), 'China': ('LOC', 5), 'Russia': ('LOC', 6), 'Iran': ('LOC', 3), 'Afghanistan': ('LOC', 1), 'Shining City on the Hill': ('LOC', 1), 'Moscow': ('LOC', 1), 'Syria': ('LOC', 1), 'Ukraine': ('LOC', 1), 'Libya': ('LOC', 1), 'Asia': ('LOC', 1), 'Pacific': ('LOC', 1)}"
139,The European Union struggles to unite countries from Eastern Europe,Cui Hongjian,2021-12-22,"As France will take over the presidency of the Council of the EU on January 1, 2022, President Emmanuel Macron has been travelling in Central and EU countries (CEECs), trying to ease the sharp contradictions between East and West EU.    Amid Macron's first stop in Budapest on a visit to enlist the unpopular Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán, Macron even attended a summit of the four Visegrad countries - Hungary, Poland, the Czech Republic and Slovakia - to reduce difficulties from CEECs during the France presidency.The appeasement of France and Germany came after the irreconcilable conflicts between the EU and CEECs like Poland and Hungary on critical issues, such as the rule of law crisis, finance, security, refugees and energy. The EU has not yet lifted the suspension of disbursement of EU funds to Poland and Hungary, which hold the position that the country's domestic law takes precedence over EU law. The bloc has constantly trapped in the geopolitical differences between CEECs and EU, and the entanglement of interests between Old EU and New EU - a major problem for the EU. After the Cold War, the EU, through its economic attraction and political influence, has largely expanded by the accession of ten CEECs that were previously under Soviet influence, including the three Baltic States neighboring Russia. The EU didn't stop there. It extended its influence eastward after the 2008 War in South Ossetia, tailoring the Eastern Partnership initiative for Ukraine, Belarus, Georgia, Moldova, Armenia, and Azerbaijan. Using ""access to the EU market"" as bait, the EU required those countries to reform, modelling the ""democracy"" and market economy of EU, in order to encircle Russia and thoroughly transform the ""post-Soviet space.""However, Russia strongly bounced back using the Crimean crisis in 2014, and pulled in a wavering Belarus with the help of its political turmoil in 2020, partially regaining control to define EU's eastern borders and form a roughly balanced situation with the EU.With Macron and Scholz's visit to CEECs, the EU simultaneously held the ""Eastern Partnership"" summit. But the absence of Belarus has left the EU's enlargement plan nearly bankrupt despite other countries' pursuit to join. What makes the Eastern border of the EU more difficult to define is the widening gap of ideas and entanglement of interests among its members. After experiencing the short-lived enjoyment of joining the EU, the ten Central and EU Countries (CEECs) felt a sense of loss due to economic imbalance and political inequality. In the tenth year of joining in 2014, the true feeling of CEECs was that being an EU member cannot ensure national prosperity alone.On internal and external issues such as refuge problems, security concerns, energy transition, reform of the rule of law and social rights, the CEECs have had more disputes with the EU, with EU as its main voice. In terms of the definition of ""New EU,"" the CEECs are regarding themselves as ""challengers"" instead of the previous ""latecomers."" They are no longer satisfied with passively accepting and obeying the EU rules and order shaped by West EU countries. Instead, they are more actively participating in the EU's power game by horizontal cooperation and proposing independent solutions.As France and some other West EU countries are proposing ""strategic autonomy,"" some CEECs, due to their distrust of the EU, are trying hard to rope in the US. Poland and Lithuania have nodded to the US troops' ""permanent presence"" on their soil, which is undoubtedly making Macron's proposal of ""EU sovereignty"" a joke.The current East-West confrontation within the EU and the battle between major powers are reshaping the eastern border of the EU. Before the CEECs gain enough voice within the EU, pressure from France and Germany, Russia's approaches in energy and geopolitics and the US' differentiation remain as the determining factors for the reshaping of the EU's eastern border.The US escalated its strategic containment of Russia, and Russia had to propose to reshape much of the entire post-Cold War EU security order by in effect restricting NATO military deployments to its borders before 1997. Meanwhile, Macron said he regarded Orban both as a political opponent and a EU partner. The EU has also said that ""Good governance, democracy, the rule of law and human rights are fundamental values that lie at the heart of the EU's relationship with partner countries and of the Eastern Partnership itself.""

140,Lithuania 'hugs America's thighs' by hyping 'China's economic coercion',Wang Qi,2021-12-22,"Lithuania continues to hype China's ""economic pressure"" after a diplomatic downgrade. Lithuanian Prime Minister Ingrida Simonyte spoked with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Tuesday. According to the US Department of State, Antony Blinken and Simonyte have reaffirmed the importance of ""robust defense and economic relations."" Experts said that Lithuania, which sees itself as a US agent within the EU, has become ""political plague"" shunned by EU businesses and politicians. The US' weak commitment means Lithuania will have to bear the consequences of friction with China on its own, at best with symbolic cajoling and compensation from Taiwan's secessionist authority.  During the phone call, Antony Blinken described China as ""coercive,"" claiming that China Customs authorities are not clearing Lithuanian shipments or shipments with Lithuanian components, and that they are rejecting import applications from Lithuania. Such claims are not true, said China Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian on Wednesday.In case of technical problems encountered in the export of certain products to China, enterprises may report to the competent China authorities through normal channels.  It is untenable for the US to make groundless accusations against China in disregard of facts, which can only reveal its real intention to sow discord, said Zhao. I have reminded Lithuania that playing tricks, passing the buck and confusing the public will not help solve the problem, Zhao said, noting that Lithuania should admit and seriously correct its mistakes, instead of ""hugging the US' thighs.""China announced a downgrade in diplomatic relations with Lithuania in November, after Lithuania allowed the Taiwan authority to set up a representative office in the name of Taiwan, a move challenging the one-China principle and encouraging secessionism. After receiving Lithuanian's complaint on China's so-called economic pressure on imports, the EU said it may involve the WTO to resolve the row. Experts said the move shows the EU is trying to get rid of the ""irrational troublemaker,"" whose provocation to China gives Brussels a ""big surprise.""  ""Economic coercion is a smear against China. All the fallout was caused by Lithuanian and US interference in China's internal affairs. They can't expect to harm China's core interests but received zero response,"" Li Haidong, a professor from China Foreign Affairs University, told the Global Times on Wednesday. ""Lithuania has failed to play a constructive role in China-EU relations. The EU has a rational understanding that the Taiwan question is China's redline, and Brussels would not want to be dragged into this,"" Zhang Hong, an EU studies expert from the China Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times on Saturday.Although Lithuania's total trade with China in 2020 was only about $2 billion, Lithuania has underestimated China's influence in the global industrial chain, experts said.  All the EU enterprises will consider the pros and cons of their business contact with Lithuanian counterparts when entering the China market on the heels of a diplomatic fallout, and Lithuania will suffer the consequences, Li said.  Last week, US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin welcomed his Lithuanian counterpart Arvydas Anušauskas to the Pentagon, awarding Lithuania the ""beacon of democracy"" for its provocation but without anything tangible. After sacrificing huge security and economic costs, the only thing Lithuania received was a $600 million export credit agreement. The US is facing many tasks, such as the epidemic, the debt, regional security.  US money is taxpayer money and the White House will not give sugar to Lithuania anymore, Zhang said. The market on Taiwan island of 23 million people is no substitute economically to the China mainland, with 1.4 billion people and a fast-growing economy, he added. Lithuania has also been active in challenging the red line of Russia. Anušauskas said on Monday that the country is ready to supply lethal weapons to Ukraine, media reported. Lithuania is too emotional and lacks political wisdom, and has severely damaged its credibility, external environment and development space, Zhang said. ""More importantly, no one really wants to help it.""  This kind of extreme ideology that serves as a pawn for the US is fundamentally wrong, Zhang said.",CHINA,DIPLOMACY,Lithuanian Prime Minister Ingrida Simonyte Photo: AFP,"Reporter, Beijing","Global Times reporter covering international affairs, cross-Straits relations and Chinese society; a captive of his experiences.","{'Lithuania': ('LOC', 9), 'China': ('LOC', 17), 'US': ('LOC', 6), 'Taiwan': ('LOC', 3), 'Brussels': ('LOC', 1), 'Lithuanian': ('MISC', 5), 'one': ('MISC', 1), 'Ingrida Simonyte': ('PER', 2), 'Antony Blinken': ('PER', 3), 'Zhao Lijian': ('PER', 3), 'Li Haidong': ('PER', 1), 'US Department of State': ('ORG', 1), 'EU': ('ORG', 3), 'Foreign Ministry': ('ORG', 1), 'EUTO': ('ORG', 1), 'Ex': ('ORG', 1), 'All': ('ORG', 1), 'University': ('ORG', 1), 'Times': ('ORG', 1)}"
141,"Showdown over Ukraine looms as Russia, NATO unlikely to reach deal",Yang Sheng,2021-12-19,"The intense situation around Ukraine between Russia and NATO is unlikely to ease, as it is almost impossible that NATO will accept the security guarantee proposed by Moscow due to entrenched hostility to Russia, China analysts said, adding that the US-led bloc will not give up expansion to the east, and Russia will definitely take action to retaliate. They noted that although China hopes the two sides can resolve the situation peacefully, the two sides are unlikely to reach a new agreement without any friction and conflict, and that if negotiations break down, at least some regional conflicts may break out.   Russia will engage in ""creating counter threats"" if NATO turns down the Russia proposals for security guarantees, Russia Deputy Foreign Minister Alexander Grushko said on Solovyov Live YouTube channel on Saturday, TASS reported on Saturday.""We are making clear that we are ready to talk about switching over from a military or a military-technical scenario to a political process"" that will strengthen the security of all countries in the area of the OCSE, Euro-Atlantic and Eurasia, he said. ""If that doesn't work out, we signaled to them [NATO] that will also move over to creating counter threats, but it will then be too late to ask US why we made these decisions and why we deployed these systems.""The Europeans must think about the prospect of turning the continent into a field of military confrontation, he said.Russia said on Friday it wanted a legally binding guarantee that NATO would give up any military activity in EU and Ukraine, part of a wish list of security guarantees it wants to negotiate with the West, Reuters reported.Yang Jin, an associate research fellow at the Institute of Russia, EU and Central Asia Studies at the China Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times on Sunday that Russia is very serious on the matter, because NATO has pushed too far in past decades which leaves Russia no space for further compromise.Moscow for the first time laid out in detail demands that it says are essential for lowering tensions in EU and defusing a crisis over Ukraine, which West countries have accused Russia of sizing up for a potential invasion after building up troops near the border. Russia has denied planning an invasion., according to the Reuters report. The demands contain elements - such as an effective Russia veto on future NATO membership for Ukraine - that the West has already ruled out. Others would imply the removal of US nuclear weapons from EU and the withdrawal of multinational NATO battalions from Poland and from the Baltic states of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania that were once in the Soviet Union., it said. ""The US-led NATO was born to be hostile toward Soviet Union and Russia, because it serves US hegemony and not regional peace. The organization doesn't care about Ukraine's security at all, so while Russia remains powerful then NATO won't stop its expansion. Maybe the more dangerous the situation is, the more interests the US can receive from the tension,"" said a Beijing-based expert on Russia and EU studies who asked not to be named.""Creating tension could bring Russia retaliation and NATO members will need US protection, and then the US leadership based on security demands will be strengthened. This is how US plays the game but many small states don't understand, or they have no choice but to be played and used by the US,"" he noted.In US, a senior administration official said the US was prepared to discuss the proposals with Russia, but added: ""That said, there are some things in those documents that the Russia know are unacceptable,"" according to Reuters. The official said US would respond some time next week with more concrete proposals on the format of any talks.Yang said the US will reject the Russia's proposals eventually, and Russia will take action, but a massive military confrontation is unlikely. However, the military conflicts in Eastern Ukraine could be escalated to some extent, and Russia will increase military deployments alongside the border.""If NATO dares deploy anti-missile or other strategic weapons systems in Ukraine, Moscow would launch a surgical strike to destroy them. This is how Russia deals with provocation when red lines have been crossed,"" he noted.",CHINA,DIPLOMACY,"A Ukrainian serviceman patrols along a position at the front line with the eastern rebels not far from Avdiivka, Donetsk region, Ukraine.

142,China-Russia entente is motivated by larger issues than rivalry with the West,Global Times,2021-12-16,"Editor's Note: China President Xi Jinping and Russia President Vladimir Putin met on Wednesday via video link. The meeting was held amid rising tensions on the Russia-Ukraine border and mounting West pressure piled on Beijing over alleged human rights abuses. During the meeting, both leaders hailed relations between China and Russia. Xi Jinping said that the Russia president ""strongly supported China's efforts to protect key national interests and firmly opposed attempts to drive a wedge between our countries,"" and Vladimir Putin declared bilateral relations ""a proper example of interstate cooperation in the 21st century."" What is the significance of the meeting at this moment? Why is the West incapable of driving a wedge between China and Russia? The Global Times collected views from two Russia experts. Danil Bochkov, an expert at the Russia International Affairs CouncilThe summit is very important as it happened at a crucial time for relations with the US and its allies. Beijing and Moscow want to demonstrate that they are united in their desire to oppose any external pressure and present a common front on the issues of international concern to avoid being isolated. This summit will contribute to the acceleration of deepening ties and could foster bilateral cooperation in the areas raised during the presidential talks including digital currency, bilateral trade in national currencies, energy cooperation, coordination of actions on international platforms and forums such as the UN. President Vladimir Putin said that ""a new model of cooperation has been formed between our countries."" Officially the new model of bilateral relations is defined as a partnership with no limits and boundaries for deeper collaboration preserved by the common recognition and mutual respect to both parties' national interests. Still, it poses no threat to third parties as Moscow and Beijing do not seek an alliance. Both sides separate relations with other global powers and are not significantly affected by their closer cooperation on the bilateral level. However, other countries are not happy with the growing entente between Moscow and Beijing which creates opposition in the West but not in China or Russia.The US and West countries recently hyped the so-called China and Russia threats in a high profile. Such rhetoric is ostensibly aimed at a collection of alliances and partners united under the same slogan of opposing rising threats from Russia and China. And it is openly proclaimed and implemented by NATO's classification of China as a challenge and US President Joe Biden's attempts to gather ""democratic states"" to preserve the world from falling into the Moscow-Beijing axis of so-called orchestrated autocracies. All these stigmas help to differentiate countries into ""good"" and ""bad"" and invite active cooperation to oppose them. However, a military confrontation is not likely since all parties involved clearly comprehend the irreversible damage such scenario could inflict internationally. Russia-China cooperation is driven by a broader range of issues and is not necessarily tied to rising pressure from the West. Moscow and Beijing signed the Treaty of Good-Neighborliness and Friendly Cooperation long before their relations with the West plunged. Since then, they have been building on that foundation and expended it. So, it did not happen out of nowhere and just because of frayed ties with the US. It was already in action and has been motivated by common interested such as regional security and stability.

The bill will wait for a signature from President Joe Biden before becoming law, media reported.

On China, the bill includes $7.1 billion for the Pacific Deterrence Initiative and a statement of congressional support for the defense of Taiwan, as well as a ban on the US Department of Defense procuring products “produced with forced labor” from China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region.US media were brief on the Taiwan parts in the act but island-based media outlet the Taiwan News reported on Thursday the bill states that the naval force of the island of Taiwan should be invited to participate in the US-led Rim of the Pacific exercise (RIMPAC) conducted in 2022. Song Zhongping, a China mainland military expert and TV commentator, believed there is a high likelihood that Joe Biden will invite the island of Taiwan to RIMPAC, considering he already offered platform for the secessionist DPP authority at the so-called “summit for democracy,” which is of the same purpose – to lift Taiwan’s international presence. The China mainland should “prepare for the worst” and get ready, in strategy and military tactics, for any scenario amid the worsening cross-Straits situations and China-US rivalry, Song said, as the US has lost multiple “handles” to contain China, including Hong Kong and Xizang (Tibet), which will make it play the “Taiwan card” hysterically. But the expert also pointed out that even if Taiwan’s armed forces join the exercise, they will only play a peripheral role. Li Haidong, professor at the Institute of International Relations of the China Foreign Affairs University, agreed that the US and DPP would increase their collusion, warning that provocations on the most sensitive topic in China-US relations will lead to more frictions and higher risks of out of control consequences. According to open data, the US has the highest military budget in the world, four times that of China’s, despite the contrast in population scale.The National Defense Authorization Act also included $300 million to support Ukraine, over which the US and NATO are in fierce dispute with Russia. Li said the shockingly high and continuously rising military budget is the foundation for the US to maintain its hegemonic status worldwide. To justify the high spending, the US has to create conflicts, crises and hype “external threats,” which only demonstrates that the US is the “destroyer of world peace.”As for the bans on Pentagon procurement of products made by so-called forced labor in China’s Xinjiang region, Li said it is nothing new amid the trend of adding the flavor of Xinjiang to any relevant or irrelevant bills and documents. Such moves fully prove the US defense act is not about defense but about making trouble for others, experts said.",CHINA,SOCIETY,"AH-64A Apache Attack Helicopters at US Army base Camp Humphreys in Pyeongtaek, South Korea.

144,Stripping off the ‘Emperor's new clothes’ of American democracy,Guan Guoping,2021-12-15,"The US' two-day ""Summit for Democracy"" ended hastily on Friday. A farce directed and starred by US President Joe Biden which roped in many countries and regions finally came to an end.Yury Tavrovsky, professor of the Russia University of Peoples' Friendship and expert on Eastern studies, once said that ""holding the summit for democracy resembles a mistress of a brothel teaching morale to schoolgirls."" He hit the nail on the head.Whether it is boasting about democracy at so-called summits or flaunting US democracy all the time on other occasions, democracy is nothing but a gimmick. Fundamentally, democracy is just ""the emperor's new clothes"" for the US.For US politicians, democracy is a hat that could be given to every one of its allies, those who are in need of the US and those who are useful for the US. Thus, US feels like its ""little brothers"" are all over the world. The so-called democracy summit convened by the US, a country with a high ""democratic deficit,"" seems impressive but is actually hollow inside.The US boasts itself as a ""democratic judge,"" and decided on its own who could participate in the summit and who could not, and which countries are ""democratic"" and which are not. Such an act is not democratic itself. Without de facto multilateralism, how could there be real democracy?Not to mention those participants under hegemonic pressure, even those US allies harbor their own thoughts. The US has consistently squeezed and suppressed its competitors, and has never been merciful to its allies. In the 1980s, the US forced Japan to sign the Plaza Accord and successfully prevented Japan from catching up with it. Now, the US has established the AUKUS security alliance with the UK and Australia, robbing France of submarine order worth tens of billions of dollars. The US always turns its back on allies as long as the condition is against its will. How can the allies that participate in the summit not have mixed feelings?France media did not shy away from their negative views on the ""Summit for Democracy."" The France newspaper Les Echos published an article to question whether the US is still a model for democracy, saying that as the US itself is deeply mired in a democratic crisis, organizing a ""Summit for Democracy"" lacks rationality.US domestic public opinion did not show mercy to the ""Summit for Democracy"" as well. The Atlantic on Sunday released a report entitled ""Diplomacy Alone Can't Save Democracy,"" questioning that ""whether diplomacy can meaningfully achieve what Joe Biden has set out to do"" and saying that ""our systems aren't working."" Time magazine said the summit is ""the height of hypocrisy"" and a ""geopolitical ploy.""The international community has shown an indifferent attitude to the ""Summit for Democracy."" The videos of the summit have received miserably few view counts on social media. Just the opposite, videos exposing the US' military intervention and killing innocent civilians under the banner of democracy are viral on the internet. Some netizens have commented that as the US and its allies have massacred countless people in Iraq, Afghanistan and Libya, are they qualified to hold an international summit to teach other countries a lesson on democracy?Former Guyanese prime minister Moses Nagamootoo criticized that the old democracy ""has exploited US, dominated US, divided US, used US, and has left US in poverty,"" and the world needs ""a new democracy"" that put people first.Anyone with a discerning eye can tell that the ""Summit for Democracy"" aims at China, attempting to lower China's moral status in the world.US deliberately arranged those anti-China rioters who messed up Hong Kong and fled to other countries to participate in the summit and smear China. It also provided a stage for Taiwan's Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) authority, challenging the one-China policy. On Human Rights Day, the US imposed new sanctions on China under the pretext of ""human rights."" Willfully waving the sticks of ""human rights,"" frantically containing and suppressing China, can the US prove itself the ""boss"" of democracy in the world?The US' performance during the ""Summit for Democracy"" was also shocking. It referred to epidemic prevention as ""restrictions on freedom,"" non-US democracy as ""authoritarian regimes,"" interfering in other countries' internal affairs as ""fighting against transnational corruption,"" and called the manipulation of internet management and forming the so-called ""Alliance for the Future of the Internet"" as ""internet governance in service of democratic values."" All of these acts reflect bandit logic full of hegemonic color.In short, the so-called ""democracy summit"" undermines democracy in the name of democracy. It sings the hymn of ""democracy,"" but is abusing and blaspheming it.For US politicians, democracy is a hat that could be given to every one of its allies, those who are in need of the US and those who are useful for the US. Thus, US feels like its ""little brothers"" are all over the world. On the one hand, it is the ""US ideal"" that everyone is born equal, and on the other hand, it is the cruel and ugly reality torn apart by racism and polarized politics. The US democracy is only an illusion amid its political decline.Looking back at the year 2021, too many scenes of US chaos have left an impressive stroke in the course of history. The deep crisis facing US society and the multiple challenges faced by US democracy have been exposed to the global spotlight.

A US Chinook helicopter flies over the U.S. Embassy in Kabul, Afghanistan on Sunday. Helicopters are landing at the US embassy there as diplomatic vehicles leave the compound as the Taliban advance on the Afghan capital. Photo: VCGAnother impressive moment along with the US' hasty ""Kabul moment"" at the end of August was the US' helplessness in the Capitol at the beginning of this year. A large number of former president Donald Trump's supporters poured into US, violently smashing the US Capitol, the symbol of the ""beacon of democracy,"" and caused serious turbulence. The aftermath of the shock still exists today. What has frozen in the world's memory is the photo of protesters rushed into the office of House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi, sitting in her chair.The Capitol riot has completely stripped of ""the emperor's new clothes"" for the US democracy. Even US politicians have admitted that the US is experiencing the worst social division and democratic crisis in history. On the one hand, it is the ""US ideal"" that everyone is born equal, and on the other hand, it is the cruel and ugly reality torn apart by racism, US First and fear.In fact, there have already been insights into the problems of US democracy in history. France political scholar Alexis de Tocqueville in his 1835 book Democracy in US warned that US democracy may become the tyranny of the majority.Ray La Raja, Professor at the University of Massachusetts, notes in an article for The Atlantic that US's current system is democratic only in form, not in substance. The nominating process is vulnerable to manipulation by plutocrats, celebrities, media figures and activists. Many presidential primary voters mistakenly back candidates who do not reflect their views.Democracy is not an ornament or a propaganda item. Instead, it is used to solve the problems for people. Whether a country is democratic or not lies in whether it truly makes the people the masters of the country. The shortcomings of the US fight against COVID-19 epidemic have been laid bare to all. Political polarization is poisoning US social culture. Under partisan struggle and with local governments being at odds with the federal government, politicians are even still entangled in debates whether to keep social distancing and wear a mask, which has caused the people to fall victim to the anti-epidemic policy.  The number of COVID-19 deaths recorded so far in 2021 has surpassed the total for 2020. With a total of over 40 million confirmed cases and more than 800,000 deaths, the US as the world's No.1 epidemic failure has completely lost face. US political scientist Francis Fukuyama who warned US all political systems are liable to decay said facing the epidemic, ""US democracy at this particular moment is very troubled."" He also said trust is exactly what is missing in US society. His judgments are confirmed by data of hate crimes in the US. According to a report by the FBI in late August, there were 7,759 hate crimes in the US last year, a 6 percent increase on 2019 and the highest number since 2008. Data showed crimes targeting Africa US and Asia US increased significantly from 2019 to 2020. Racism has become the biggest reason for the hate crimes spike.  Dating back, there are more chaos and crises concealed under US democracy. When the financial crisis spread to the world from the US, when the Occupy Wall Street movement laid bare the gap between the rich and poor as well as social injustice, when WikiLeaks exposed the surveillance practices of the US intelligence services, and when human rights violations at Guantanamo and others continued to test morality and conscience, US politicians should have reflected on whether something had gone wrong with the US democracy. Unfortunately, those politicians staying in the ""city upon a hill"" have long been stuck in an illusion that US democracy is superior. They are accustomed to looking down upon others but blind to the dysfunction of US democracy: The Capitol riots shocked the world, the death of George Floyd triggered waves of widespread protests, the pandemic spiraling out of control has led to tragedies, and it has become a cruel fact that the rich get richer while the poor become poorer. Just as Singaporean scholar Kishore Mahbubani said, the US has lost its way. US's incredible sense of triumphalism after the Cold War blinded it and ignore the rise of China, India and the rest of the world.To play the democratic card, one needs to play words to deceive the people. The US literally says ""one person, one vote,"" but the truth about US democracy is ""a minority of elites rule."" It's ""a game of the rich people"" based on money. Today's US-style democracy is gravely ill. Problems like money politics, identity politics, partisan politics, political polarization, social division, racial tension and wealth gap have become more acute.The US-style democracy is a rich people's game based on capital. According to statistics, winners of 91 percent of US Congressional elections are the candidates with greater financial support.The US-style democracy is ""one person one vote"" in name, but ""rule of the minority elite"" in reality. The checks and balances have resulted in a ""vetocracy"" and partisan interests have been put above national development. The shortcomings of the electoral system are obvious, and practices of gerrymandering are prevalent, which undermines fairness and justice. When democracy is sick, the way it functions should be reviewed. The US is ill. It needs to check its internal affairs and diplomacy. However, it instead convened a ""Summit for Democracy,"" asking its allies to take medicine together. If it can, the US would demand all the world to take medicine together. But facing an increasingly multi-polarized world, the US cannot be as arrogant and bossy to others as it used to be. The so-called democracy is just an enhancer. In fact, what Joe Biden is really concerned about is not ""democratic backsliding,"" but the decline of the US in the fields of economy, politics and hegemony. This is a clear and indisputable fact. The so-called democracy summit convened by the US is to rally all its allies, in a bid to stop its own decline and counter the rise of China.In contrast to Donald Trump's banner of ""US First,"" exploiting ""the US loves democracy"" as a narrative, Joe Biden engages in establishing small cliques and circles under the cold war mind-set and claims that ""the struggle between democracy and autocracy"" is the mainstream of the relations between countries today.This set of democratic discourse that has long been accompanied by West capitalism and the expansion of US hegemony has long been full of loopholes in the face of history and reality.From the perspective of national governance, West countries are incapable of carrying out social reforms but have to increase the legitimacy of their rule by virtue of democratic discourse. In this context, they can only interpret the concept of ""democracy"" in a narrow sense - first, separate economic and political connotations from each other, and simply equate ""democracy"" to ""political democracy,"" and then proceduralize ""political democracy,"" making it equivalent to ""electoral democracy.""Today, ""free elections"" as a symbol of democracy have long been reduced to ""games for the rich."" In an interview, US scholar Noam Chomsky cited Princeton University Professor Martin Gilens' book that the lower 70 percent have no influence on policy, so they're essentially disenfranchised. Gilens  and Northwestern University Prof Benjamin I Page concluded that the US is an oligarchy, not a democracy after reviewing answers to 1,779 survey questions asked between 1981 and 2002 on public policy issues. The history of the evolution of West democratic discourse is actually a process of gradual narrowing and finally deviating from the essence of ""democracy."" However, in the practice of democratic promotion accompanied by hegemony, the US and the West have forcibly generalized and deified their hypocritical values as ""universal values"" - all other countries must accept such a West model, and the ""separation of powers,"" ""representative democracy"" and ""competitive election"" in West political models have become the ""golden rule"" in the West democratic discourse.Democracy is the right of the people of all countries, not the patent of a few. As a matter of fact, the successful development of China's whole-process of people's democracy and its own political model has completely negated the ""universal nature of the West model"" and West countries' monopoly on democratic discourse.In an interview with the Xinhua News Agency, Carlos Martinez, a UK author and political commentator said China's whole-process people's democracy is far more meaningfully democratic than the West liberal democracy. He added that ""the basic interests of ordinary people in China are represented in government to a far greater degree than the case in the West.""The development of democracy in a country is accompanied by and interacts with the governance capacity of the country. It is impossible for a country with dysfunctional governance and a host of domestic problems to become a model of democracy for the world. Earlier this year, a Pew survey shows that 72 percent of US believe that the US is no longer a ""model of democracy for other countries to emulate."" Another Pew Research Center survey released on November 2 shows that few believe that US democracy, at least in its present state, is a good model for other countries.The US' West allies have also lost faith in US democracy. According to the survey carried out by the Latana polling company between February and April, 44 percent of respondents in the 53 countries surveyed are concerned that the US threatens democracy in their country.Obviously, the ""Summit for Democracy"" organized by the US, a country with a dysfunctional democracy, is destined to be unappealing. It can only be a joke.While the US enjoys its hegemony, others suffer from all the disasters. The US has been promoting ""democratic reform,"" instigating ""color revolutions,"" and indiscriminately applying unilateral sanctions. These all prove that US democracy is used to cover up its hegemony.Machiavellianism, the political philosophy of Italy philosopher Niccolo Machiavelli, is well known in the West. Machiavelli's word ""It is much safer to be feared than loved"" is a golden saying in many people's eyes.The essence of Machiavellianism is that it is normal to gain power by fair means or foul. And this is also confirmed by US's hegemonic practice over a long period of time.If we look back at the global affairs since the Cold War, it is clear that the US democratic discourse is parasitic on hegemony and serves hegemony. The US has instrumentalized and weaponized democracy. Its deeds are actually against democracy despite under the name of democracy. US has also incited division and confrontation to distract from problems at home and maintain its dominance in the world. This has seriously undermined the international system with the UN as the core and the international order based on international law.  Whether it is Donald Trump who advocates ""US First"" directly, or President Joe Biden, who is ""returning"" to US democratic discourse and strengthening US alliance, the only thing on their minds is US's hegemony.However, what people have seen from the harsh reality is that while the US enjoys its hegemony, others suffer from all the disasters.Pursuing hegemony under the banner of democracy, the US cannot make the world benefit from democracy. Instead, it has created endless disasters and turmoil. For a long time, the US has been imposing its political system and values on others. The US has been promoting ""democratic reform,"" indiscriminately applying unilateral sanctions, and instigating ""color revolutions."" These all have caused disastrous consequences. ""Democracy"" has become a ""weapon of mass destruction"" used by the US to interfere in other countries' affairs. With the advantage of its discourse, US has packaged its democracy as ""universal values"" and start waves of ""democratization"" around the world. But in fact, it has become a ""slow-acting poison"" to destroy developing countries.People have seen that the US' promotion of democracy is about overthrowing one country's government.Since the end of the Cold War, ""color revolutions"" have continued to occur in many parts of the world. And behind them hides the hand of the US. This includes the ""Rose Revolution"" in Georgia in 2003, the ""Orange Revolution"" in Ukraine in 2004, the ""Jasmine Revolution"" in Tunisia in 2010, the ""Arab Spring"" in the Middle East in 2011, and the ""Second Color Revolution"" in Ukraine in 2014. The result of all these events was that the governments were overthrown, the countries ended up in turmoil, development of the countries was hindered, and the people suffered.People have seen that the US' spreading democracy is about spreading war.Since 2001, about 241,000 people have been killed in the war zones of Afghanistan and Pakistan.  From March 2003 to April 2019, about 183,000 to 206,000 Iraqi civilians died of violence. The conflict in Yemen incited by the ""Arab Spring"" caused about 233,000 deaths. From March 2011 to March 2021, 350,209 people died in the Syrian conflict with known names, among whom about 1 out of every 13 victims was a woman or a child.US democracy is about completely denying the right of non-West countries to independently determine their own political and economic development models. It is also about labeling dissidents and competitors as ""authoritarians"" or external threats and thus to suppress them by any means, even by force. The humanitarian disasters caused by the US in the name of democracy are truly endless.People have seen that the US' advocacy of democracy is about making money.For the US, democracy is a tool to whitewash hegemony; a hegemony always export war, and war can make money. This is the real logic of US democracy. According to a report about major beneficiaries of the war in Afghanistan released by The Security Policy Reform Institute, an independent US think tank, the five largest US arms giants - Lockheed Martin, Raytheon, General Dynamics, Boeing and Northrop Grumman - earned more than $2 trillion from the US government's input in the war in Afghanistan.The US has been at war for more than 92 percent of the time since its birth, and the peace time of it has lasted less than 20 years. The US still maintains about 750 overseas military bases in 80 countries by October 2021. In the 44 years from 1948 to 1991, the US launched 46 foreign military interventions, but in the 26 years from 1992 to 2017, the number reached 188. These alarming figures are all under a seemingly honorable banner - for democracy, but behind them is the rigid demand to keep profiting from wars. This shows that the US' promotion of democracy and its pursuit of hegemony, like the shadow and cover, may be able to deceive the world for a while, but will eventually be spurned by the people of the world. The so-called ""Summit for Democracy"" is bound to end in the same way. ""Government of the people, by the people, for the people"" used to be the expectation of the US sages for good governance, but the reality in the US is that it ignores the people's rights, cares nothing about the people's opinions, and doesn't help the people's livelihood, which makes US-style democracy pale in comparison. More than 150 years ago, president Abraham Lincoln expressed in his Gettysburg Address the hope that ""government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth."" With the passage of time, the US democratic system has gradually alienated and degenerated, increasingly deviating from the core of democracy and its original purpose. What intertwine in the US society are various political, economic, and social problems, including money politics, partisan wrangle, political polarization, debt burden, budget crisis, hollowing out of manufacturing industry, social rifts, racial tension, as well as wealth gap between rich and poor. In this process, the function of the US democracy is declining, leaving Lincoln's words in disgrace. As pointed out in the report ""Ten Questions for US Democracy"" issued by Chongyang Institute for Financial Studies, Renmin University of China, in the name of ""democracy,"" the only ones in the US that can reflect their will are Money-cracy, Gun-cracy, White-cracy, Media-cracy, Milita-cracy, and Drug-cracy. It is not the people who can make the decision, ""six masters in one country, there is no democracy.""-- Ignoring the people's rights, US-style democracy is reduced to a show. The US TV series House of Cards is an eye-opening look at the ""game of thrones"" in  US politics, which is full of intrigue and unscrupulous tactics. One of the lead actors, however, said this Netflix show ""isn't that far from the reality of politics in US."" In fact, the tactics of the US politicians go far beyond what the drama has shown to the public. People's rights are selectively ignored and substantially manipulated or even exploited in the process of seizing power. Against the backdrop of ""Donkey vs Elephant,"" the two US major parties have always limited popular political participation to a narrow range of people and regard the rest as ""crowd players"" in the election game. Changing presidents will not improve US democracy. In the months since Joe Biden took office, COVID-19 states have enacted 33 laws that make it more difficult for people to vote, some states have replaced nonpartisan election chiefs with partisan ones and Republican-controlled state legislatures redrew their electoral maps in favor of their own party in some red states with blue-lean tendency, such as North Carolina and Texas, effectively disenfranchising communities of color. Along with the right to vote, the right to life is also being ignored. In May 2020, a black man George Floyd was kneed on the neck by a white police officer and died after repeatedly saying ""I can't breathe,"" triggering then the Black Lives Matter movement that swept across the US. This is just a glimpse of the serious human rights problems in the US. Systemic racism is deeply rooted in the US, with many minorities, including Africa and Asia US, living in discrimination and fear, and more than 40 million people struggling with poverty. Not to mention the horrific slaughter of Native US, the blood-filled exploitation and oppression of black slaves, the abuse of large number s of Native US children in residential schools, and so on throughout US history. Gun control policies that are welcomed by most people, though, are strongly opposed by the National Rifle Association and other pro-gun groups. Data from the nonprofit Gun Violence Archive reveals that gun violence-related deaths in 2020 exceed 40,000. Every gunshot marks people's nightmare and the heartbreaking grief of the casualties' families. As the debate over gun control is still endless, ""you need to wear armor to live here.""--Irrelevant to public opinion, US-style democracy operates selectively. In March 2020, when asked ""how are non-symptomatic professional athletes getting tests while others are waiting in line and can't get them?"" Donald Trump answered: ""Perhaps that's the story of life."" This answer reflects how the US politics actually works, that is, power tends to serve the interests of the few wealthy people rather than the majority of voters. US politicians shout about the people on the stage but make deals behind the scenes. Once elected, they often serve their donors as their spokespersons, instead of speaking for the public. A study of voting patterns in the US Senate found that the preferences of senators reflect those of donors more than other groups. Joseph Stiglitz, a Nobel Prize-winning economist and leading US economist, raised the problem of ""government of the 1%, by the 1%, and for the 1%.""It's easy to understand why the public in the US is only awakened at the election day and forced dormant afterwards. They have to listen to smashing slogans during the campaign and be silent afterwards. The healthcare bills that attracted wide attentions of ordinary US people have been stymied by insurance and medical industry groups. Data showed that lobbying spending nearly reached $3.5 billion in 2020, with the health sector being the top lobbying spender in the year. Those from the health sector entered into government through revolving door and became high-level officials have protected the interest groups and large pharmaceutical companies that hold monopoly in the sector, helping them secure high profits by using patent and monopolistic medical contracts. Instead, they don't care the appeal of every four in five US that the healthcare fee is too high.--No help to people's livelihood, US democracy deviates from essence of democracyIn 2016, a book about the downfall of the Rust Belt, Hillbilly Elegy: A Memoir of a Family and Culture in Crisis, was published and soon became a bestseller. This reflects the increasing dilemma of the middle class in the US. Data shows that the US middle class has shrunk in the past years, while the wealth of some US families is currently no higher than its level two decades ago.As the middle class is in such a situation, how about the grassroots people? Their basic right to live is unsecured, many people become homeless, the education gap is widening while the number of people in poverty stays high. In 2020, over 50 million people in the US did not have enough food to eat, roughly 580,000 people were experiencing homelessness, and more than 220,000 slept on the streets. Whether a system is ""of the people, by the people, for the people"" is not determined by how it is described but how it is carried out. Apparently, in the so-called US-style democracy, the politics of partisanship, money, and veto cannot bring about high-quality governance people are longing for, but repeated shutdown of government, constant infighting between federal and state governments, ineptitude in rescuing people buried under collapsed apartment building and in disaster relief, slow  advance of infrastructure, and weak implementation of federal mandates. The number of US dissatisfied with the direction of the US has increased from 33 percent in 2017 to 50 percent in 2021, while 85 percent of US believe that the US' political system needs significant change or overhaul.A China poem goes, those who intend to defame the history trend won't last but end up with their reputation discredited. As the so-called summit for democracy ended hastily, the noise brought about is disappearing, but people don't stop the thinking and reflection on democracy. Who is standing on the moral high ground of democracy? It is not the US. And the US is definitely unqualified to pose as a ""democracy preacher."" To people around the world, including US people, the US-style democracy is by no means a model. In response to Joe Biden's summit, some US walked into streets to protest. People gathered behind a mock coffin, holding scythes with ""Big Money,"" ""Voter Suppression,"" ""Partisan Districts,"" and ""Election Subversion"" written on them and placards and held a funeral procession for US democracy. The Joe Biden administration hoped it can restore the reputation of the US damaged by various domestic and diplomatic crises. However, it can hardly gain what it wants by playing the ""democracy card"" as US-style democracy cold-shoulders the voters while it colludes with hegemony and politics of money.History won't end. The times will march on. In the face of the great changes unseen in a century and the dire pandemic, the international community needs, more than ever, to strengthen unity and cooperation based on the international relations norms characterized by the UN Charter, advance universal values including peace, development, fairness, justice, democracy, freedom be upheld to actively promote democratization of international relations and the construction of a community with a shared future for mankind. This is the just path for the world. The author is a current affairs commentator. opinion@globaltimes.com.cn",OPINION,VIEWPOINT,Illustration: Liu Rui/GT,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'US': ('LOC', 18), 'Japan': ('LOC', 2), 'UK': ('LOC', 1), 'Australia': ('LOC', 1), 'France': ('LOC', 3), 'Summit for Democracy': ('MISC', 4), 'Eastern': ('MISC', 1), 'Plaza Accord': ('MISC', 1), 'Joe Biden': ('PER', 1), 'Yury Tavrovsky': ('PER', 1), ""Russia University of Peoples ' Friendship"": ('ORG', 1), 'AUKUS': ('ORG', 1), 'Echo': ('ORG', 1)}"
145,"US should learn to respect core interests of China, Russia: Global Times editorial",Global Times,2021-12-15,"President Xi Jinping met with Russia President Vladimir Putin via video link on Wednesday afternoon. This is the second time this year that the two leaders held a virtual summit, and the 37th time since 2013. From January to November this year, bilateral trade reached more than 843 billion yuan ($132 billion), which was a 24 percent spike and exceeded trade last year. The prospects of bilateral economic cooperation are encouraging. The two leaders talked about a wide spectrum of topics, and both expressed satisfaction with the current development of China-Russia ties.The readouts from both sides about this summit focused on bilateral relations, and did not mention either ""the US"" or ""the West,"" both of whom, however, gave enormous attention to this meeting.The US and the West have recently intensified their threats to Russia and China, portraying them as destructive forces in Ukraine and the Taiwan Straits, and hyping to stay vigilant on China and Russia waging an ""invasion."" They have piled more military and political pressure, in an attempt to force China and Russia to retreat from their core national interests.US is making the historic mistake of pushing China and Russia too far at the same time. It has overindulged the expansion of egocentrism, and fabricated lies that China and Russia have ""broken international rules"" and ""challenged the international order."" It has created strong faith in these lies in the West, forcing itself to engage in dangerous confrontations with China and Russia.Russia is clearly in overall strategic contraction after the disintegration of the Soviet Union, while China is promoting its peaceful development. The two countries' disputes with the periphery have been triggered by historical factors, and their significance is limited to the local area.  Other issues which the US and the West have repeatedly hyped are the internal affairs of China and Russia. The US and the West have maliciously and falsely characterized those issues, solidifying and amplifying the confrontation.To contain China and Russia simultaneously is arrogant thinking. Although the US has an advantage in terms of strength, it cannot crush either China or Russia. Having a strategic collision with any of the two countries will bring unbearable costs to the US. It's a nightmare for US when China and Russia join hands. It's generally believed that only when US has a strong external enemy can its domestic politics function. Otherwise, it will be at a loss as to what to do. But US allies shouldn't be infected with US's ""obsessive-compulsive disorder"" or share the risks of a new cold war.We must warn individual forces that they are playing with fire when they completely obey the US order or even rely on US power to provoke China and Russia without a bottom line. They'd better not misunderstand the US commitment of protection. Should they cross the red line, punishment will be inevitable, whether they are US allies or not. After a shameful escape from Afghanistan, the US has been threatening China and Russia over the situation in the Taiwan Straits and Ukraine. However, since the US has never pledged it would send troops in case of a war, those forces provoking China and Russia should be clear that US is pushing them to the frontline, while US troops have no intention to stand with them when a war breaks out. China and Russia have prioritized peaceful development in their national strategies and wish to avoid conflict. The fundamental reason why the US and the West think that China and Russia are trying to ""start a war"" is that they have pushed them so hard that both countries have to make some response and resistance, regarded by the West as a risky provocation. It is time for the US and the West to try to ""step back and meet a broad world.""Threatening and coercing a major power is a bad choice. It is especially unwise when doing so against two major powers. US should learn to respect the core interests of the other major powers. The world's superpower should not be obsessed with sheer strength and think it can do anything. This is the key element US is required to have and this affects world peace.",OPINION,EDITORIAL,"Chinese President Xi Jinping holds a virtual meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Beijing, December 15, 2021.

147,US awards Lithuania ‘beacon of democracy’ for its provocation,Global Times,2021-12-15,"Lithuania, a country now trapped in a maze after provoking China and Russia, won a big ""award"" from the US: regional ""beacon of democracy."" On Monday local time, when US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin welcomed his Lithuanian counterpart Arvydas Anušauskas to the Pentagon, he said, ""Lithuania has become a beacon of democracy in the region. That includes hosting exiled Russia and Belarus opposition leaders, which sets an important example for other allies to follow.""The US offered Lithuania ""a reciprocal defense procurement agreement,"" and promised to work together ""to advance our shared interests and values."" Anušauskas responded by kissing up to the US. What makes Lithuania a qualified ""beacon of democracy?"" The answer is not that the country did anything outstanding in democracy, but it dares to provoke major powers to serve US's interests. According to US logic, a country that hosts exiled opposition leaders from other countries can be viewed as a ""beacon of democracy."" ""This is a flagrant violation of the UN's principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of other sovereign states,"" Sun Keqin, a research fellow at the China Institutes of Contemporary International Relations, told the Global Times.In other words, Lithuania was ""awarded"" by the US for violating the UN Charter. The least Vilnius should do is get cocky; it should be vigilant. ""Otherwise, the beacon will very soon burn itself,"" Sun added. For the US, Lithuania and ""democracy"" are tools. All tools have to play their part in line with the US playbook. Otherwise, take a look at what could happen when Lithuania did not earnestly coordinate US sanctions against Belaruskali, Belarus' potash giant. Its foreign minister and transport minister were inches away from stepping down. The US is far from caring whether the sanction will hurt Lithuania's interests, even though the small country just jumped up and down for US to provoke China with the Taiwan question. Except for cajoling those brainless small countries, the US can hardly bring them any substantial help. US is making bricks without straw. And everything the US could offer now is an empty title - ""beacon of democracy."" Whichever country or region is praised by the US as a ""beacon,"" it will basically end up being US cannon fodder. Be it Georgia, Ukraine, Tunisia or the Middle East, where US promotes democracy, these places will witness chaos, governments are overturned, development was blocked, and people suffer.  Lithuania is another cannon fodder which is not worth much in the eyes of the US. US is taking advantage of it. Unfortunately, it feels honored to be utilized by the US.  Lithuania is resolutely putting itself in a hostile position against Russia and China. It is sad those Lithuanian politicians failed to see their shortsightedness in doing so. Lithuania is next to Belarus and Russia, while border disputes there are extremely sensitive and the geopolitical tinderbox is heating up. ""If there were to be an armed showdown between NATO and Russia, one of the most likely locations would be Lithuania,"" Al Jazeera reported as early as September 2020. Yet NATO does not necessarily want an armed showdown. ""If Lithuania continues to provoke Belarus and Russia, it will throw NATO under the bus. If the Baltic country keeps challenging China, EU will be dragged into a predicament,"" Sun said. Lithuania is playing with fire by challenging the mainstream interests of NATO and the EU, he added. But once Lithuania burns itself, can the title ""beacon of democracy"" save it?",OPINION,OBSERVER,"US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin welcomes Lithuanian Defense Minister Arvydas Anusauskas to the Pentagon on December 13, 2021.

148,How far will EU follow the US in its ideological rivalry with China in 2022?,Zhang Han and Xu Yelu,2021-12-14,"The EU (EU) has hesitated to follow the US suit, and decided at the foreign ministers' meeting on Monday it will refrain from making a joint decision to not send government officials to the Beijing 2022 Olympic and Paralympic Winter Olympic Games. Observers said the decision is emblematic of the bloc's difficult struggle to find a path out of the China-US rivalry, even though the EU is inclined to follow the US in playing the ""ideology cards.""A delegation of France lawmakers will reportedly visit the island of Taiwan amid EU's escalating interactions with the secessionist Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) authority in the island. The just-concluded G7 summit in Liverpool, UK, attempted to pin the label of ""economic coercion"" on China as the West is unnerved by China's rise. EU accusations of human rights violations in China's Xinjiang and Hong Kong regions have led to bills and sanctions. The increasing complexities in China-EU relations prompted observers to ask to what extent the bloc will follow the US in its containing of China under the banner of ideology in 2022. The EU has been seeking a joint stance on the attendance of government officials at the Beijing Winter Olympic Games, and EU leaders are set to debate the issue on Thursday, which was brought to the table by France, president of the EU Council in 2022, and the Netherlands.  France President Emmanuel Macron said earlier that France will not join the US and its allies in a ""diplomatic boycott."" France Education and Sports Minister Jean-Michel Blanquer warned against politicizing sports but also said the country will continue to condemn China on the so-called human rights violations, France24 reported. The mixed attitudes of France reflect the EU's careful yet difficult handling of the China-EU relations, observers said on Tuesday, predicting that China-EU relations will see another complicated year full of uncertainties in 2022 amid the China-US rivalry. The Joe Biden administration has continued the Donald Trump administration's strategic goal of containing China, but with a different method - doing it multilaterally and uniting traditional transatlantic allies as well as non-West countries like Japan to form alliances based on values, Zhao Junjie, a research fellow at the China Academy of Social Sciences' (CASS) Institute of EU Studies, told the Global Times on Tuesday. The ""summit for democracy"" convened by US President Joe Biden is one among many examples.  Wrapping up EU moves in the past year, including remarks criticizing China's policies in Hong Kong and Xinjiang regions, sanctions under the excuse of ""human rights,"" some countries' provocative interactions with the island of Taiwan and louder voices in an attempt to hijack the entire EU on this issue, Zhao believes these signals prove the EU has answered the US' bugle call and therefore ideological frictions between the EU and China may increase in 2022. Sun Keqin, a research fellow at the China Institutes of Contemporary International Relations (CICIR) in Beijing, see differences in the US and EU's China strategy despite their proximity in values. The US uses ideology and values as a tool and weapon to form value-centered cliques to besiege China, which it regards as an all-round rival, and to assert US hegemonic status, Sun told the Global Times on Tuesday.The EU treats China threefold as a partner, a competitor and a rival in political systems, which determined there are multiple facets in EU's China policies in the background of ""predictable more frequent West-launched ideological attacks against China,"" Sun said. Potential frictions In addition to the EU's internal negotiations on whether to send government officials to the Beijing 2022 Games, the Taiwan question has become a point of contention in the China-EU relations recently due to some countries' instigation. After Lithuania's provocations over the island of Taiwan which prompted China to downgrade diplomatic relations with it, the tiny Baltic country has sought EU protection with the support of some anti-China politicians. The EU Commission has put forward an ""anti-coercion instrument"" in response.  Traditionally the EU had little interest in getting involved in the cross-Taiwan Straits topics, but the latest developments indicate the US has successfully cultivated agent states to hijack EU to play the ""Taiwan card"" at US's will.Experts warned that the US is trying to mold the island of Taiwan into a ""democratic model"" by inviting the island to international organizations and giving it platform at the just-concluded ""summit for democracy."" With those tactics to enlarge Taiwan's ""international presence,"" the US could engage the EU to treat Taiwan island as an ""ideological ally."" For the Indo-Pacific and the China Sea, while the US flexes its muscles and cares most about its hegemonic status, the EU has kept ""freedom of navigation"" and security of supply chains in mind, and appears reluctant to invest too many resources in it, said Sun, the expert from CICIR. Since the Communist Party of China will convene its 20th National Congress in the second half of 2022, the US will definitely put China's system under close scrutiny and will miss no chance to smear its path, and it remains to be seen to what extent the EU will follow, Sun said. Experts agreed that topics concerning human rights in China's Hong Kong and Xinjiang regions are areas where the US and EU share the largest consensus.Zhao from CASS said that in addition to EU remarks condemning China and bills, which are ""symbolic fists,"" it is noteworthy that the bloc is adding ""solid punches"" and bundling ideology with economic and trade relations, citing sanctions over Xinjiang cotton as an example. General trendDespite an investment pact pending under the shadow of political uncertainties, China-EU trade volume in the first 10 months of 2021 reached $670.4 billion, surpassing the total for 2020, when COVID-19 swept across the world, according to the China Mission to the EU. Dubbing bilateral relations as ""cold politics, hot economics"" in the past year, Zhao believes the trade performance is the most obvious indicator for the resilience of China-EU relations, and the EU also believes politics is not the only benchmark to evaluate bilateral ties and will try hard to maintain autonomy in diplomacy. Sun pointed out that the EU and China have a range of areas to enhance cooperation including fight against COVID-19 pandemic, economic recovery, dealing with climate change and green economy. The two sides also have large shared interests in global governance and close cultural and personnel exchanges, which ensure bilateral relations do not go to extremes. Some negative elements, like US' client states and the EU Parliament, will narrow the buffer zone the EU has but will not be able to make sudden changes in steering the bloc's China policy, the expert said. He Zhigao, also a research fellow with CASS, noted that as the EU is not an ironclad monolithic bloc, each member country has different priorities and concerns. Positioning China as a ""partner, competitor and rival"" demonstrates the complexity of EU policies toward China, the expert said. But some observers warned frictions on ideology and values, if continuing to expand and escalate, will ultimately erode the cooperation foundation and jeopardize the most important stabilizer of China-EU relations. At the just-concluded G7 foreign and development ministers' summit, a joint statement called China a ""economic coercer,"" signaling the danger of demonizing China in economics and trade sectors amid an ideological warfare. As part of the major power politics, the China-EU relations will also be affected by how Russia's relations with the US and the EU develop in 2022, observers said, noting the quadrilateral dynamics will have an impact on EU's positioning of China. Joe Biden and Russia President Vladimir Putin had a ""candid and tough-toned"" meeting last week, the fourth of its kind in 2021, without yielding meaningful results.  The EU and Russia, meanwhile, are locked in fierce conflicts on issues of Ukraine and Belarus.",CHINA,DIPLOMACY,"Flags of the European Union fly outside the EU headquarters in Brussels, Belgium, May 21, 2021.

149,"Xi-Putin meeting expected to draw up 2022 plan for bilateral ties, break rumors sowing discord",Xu Keyue,2021-12-13,"
China President Xi Jinping will have a virtual meeting with Russia President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday, during which the two leaders will review bilateral relations and cooperation achievements over the year, draw up top-level design for the development of bilateral ties for next year and exchange views on major international and regional issues of common concern, the China Foreign Ministry announced on Monday.Analysts and officials believe that the meeting is significant and timely as it will not only solidify the mutual political trust of the two countries, chart the course for already close communication and cooperation in politics, economy, military and people-to-people exchanges for next year amid reckless US crackdowns and smears. It is also seen as a response to doubts in the West over China-Russia relations as the US seeks to align its allies to confront both and even attempt to drive a wedge to split their ties following Vladimir Putin’s recent talks with US President Joe Biden, analysts said.Speaking at Monday’s press conference, Wang Wenbin, a spokesperson of the China Foreign Ministry said the meeting between the top leaders of China and Russia is expected to further enhance high-level mutual trust, vigorously promote close strategic coordination and the robust development of all-round practical cooperation between China and Russia, and inject more stability and positive energy into the turbulent and intertwined international situation.  After Russia held leadership meetings with the US and India and is likely to have another with the US, the meeting with China will break rumors aimed at sowing discord between the two countries, said Yang Jin, an associate research fellow at the EU and Central Asia Studies Center of the China Academy of Social Sciences. CNN on Sunday reported that Vladimir Putin told US President Joe Biden he would ""really like"" to meet for more talks, citing a video clip released by Russia state TV on Sunday from the leaders' virtual call last week.Vladimir Putin and Joe Biden spoke in a video call on December 7 as tensions between the US and Russia escalate. Ukraine tensions were one of the focuses during the call. Given that Russia is in a critical period of making power arrangements as Vladimir Putin's presidency is scheduled to expire in 2024, a stable internal and external environment is of urgent need, Cui Heng, a post-doctorate researcher from the Center for Russia Studies of China Normal University, told the Global Times on Monday. China and Russia can support each other in sticking to their own paths of development, serve as the backbone for each other's political legitimacy, and jointly oppose the West's incitement of “color revolutions” and stigmatization against the two countries, Cui said. It is also hoped that the situation in Ukraine remains peaceful and stable, and disputes and conflicts should be resolved within the framework of dialogue and consultations, Yang said.  During the upcoming Xi Jinping-Vladimir Putin meeting, the two will not only discuss the anti-pandemic and energy cooperation, but also Russia’s support for China’s hosting of the Beijing Winter Olympic Games, more cooperation in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization under the Belt and Road Initiative, and Central Asia issues, Yang predicted. The meeting could also cover the situation in Afghanistan and other regional issues, he said.The meeting is of great significance for global stability, economic recovery and reconstruction in the post-pandemic era and the further consolidation of the strategic partnership between the two countries, Yang told the Global Times on Monday.In recent years, Beijing and Moscow have stepped up cooperation on many fronts, be they military, trade or people-to-people exchanges. The frequent interactions between the top leaders of the two countries also help cement bilateral ties and lend stability and positive energy to the international situation. The two sent congratulatory letters to the closing ceremony of the China-Russia Year of Scientific and Technological Innovation in late November. Vladimir Putin has ""gladly accepted China’s invitation"" to attend the opening ceremony of the Winter Olympic Games in February and the two countries are in close communication on Vladimir Putin's trip. The two top leaders also talked over phone in August, during which they stressed strengthening coordination on Afghanistan, which analysts said showed that the two major powers are acting as responsible countries in helping address the chaos in Afghanistan and maintain the international order.  They also jointly announced the extension of the China-Russia Treaty of Good-Neighborliness and Friendly Cooperation in June via video link, three days ahead of the centennial of the Communist Party of China (CPC), while Vladimir Putin congratulated Xi Jinping on the CPC's centenary and expressed hopes for enhanced China-Russia inter-party exchanges.Citing the recent democracy summit initiated by the US, Cui said it exposed Joe Biden’s wishful thinking to build a camp with the Cold War mentality against China, Russia and other countries by ideological divisions. Only by joining hands can China and Russia counter the attack from the US-led clique and avoid falling into passivity, Cui stressed.As the epidemic has been at its peak since mid-September in Russia, cooperation in the fight against COVID-19 outbreaks is imperative, Cui said, noting that helping Russia can also consolidate China’s achievements in preventing and controlling imported infections, Cui said.   During the reconstruction of the value chain, the two countries should further deepen industrial cooperation, Cui said. In addition to large-scale trade, there is still broad space for bilateral cooperation in the formation of industrial chains in agriculture, biomedicine, machinery, shipbuilding, and other fields, Cui said.",CHINA,DIPLOMACY,China Russia VCG,"Reporter, Beijing","Global Times reporter following Australia and Japan issues, also with a focus on social issues and overseas studies.","{'China': ('LOC', 9), 'Russia': ('LOC', 10), 'US': ('LOC', 7), 'West': ('LOC', 1), 'India': ('LOC', 1), 'Ukraine': ('LOC', 1), 'Xi Jinping': ('PER', 1), 'Vladimir Putin': ('PER', 5), 'Joe Biden': ('PER', 2), 'Wang Wenbin': ('PER', 1), 'Yang Jin': ('PER', 1), 'Joe B': ('PER', 1), 'Foreign Ministry': ('ORG', 2), 'EU': ('ORG', 1), 'Central Asia Studies Center': ('ORG', 2), 'China Academy of Social Sciences': ('ORG', 1), 'CNN': ('ORG', 1)}"
150,"8 years have passed, Western leaders' lack of vision continues from Sochi to Beijing",Andrey Kortunov,2021-12-12,"The US recently confirmed that it would not send any official or diplomatic representatives to the Winter Olympic Games and Paralympics in February 2022 due to China's alleged ""ongoing genocide and crimes against humanity in Xinjiang and other human rights abuses."" Make no mistake - this tough language does not imply a total boycott of the Games - US athletes are not banned from competing for Olympic medals in China, and US fans will have a chance to cheer their compatriots on offline, provided that these fans manage to get to Beijing amid existing strict COVID-19 restrictions. The US decision is mostly symbolic: The Joe Biden administration, as White House press secretary Jen Psaki stated, ""will not be contributing to the fanfare of the Games.""Thinking about this US decision I am compelled to recollect the Winter Olympic Games of 2014 held in the city of Sochi along Russia's Black Sea coast. One should note that the Games happened to be one of President Vladimir Putin's most cherished personal initiatives. The Russia leader had spent a lot of his time and energy monitoring progress at numerous development sites, visiting future Olympic facilities, guiding construction teams, reviewing budgets, and observing expenditures. He looked forward to presenting the results of his efforts to the international community. When the work was finally completed, he invited many foreign leaders to come to Sochi and to share with him his hard-earned jamboree.   Unfortunately, almost all heads of West states found ""compelling"" reasons not to include a trip to Sochi into their travel plans. Barack Obama and Angela Merkel, Francois Holland and David Cameron - all of them turned down Vladimir Putin's invitation. This was not a formal diplomatic boycott: Some of the no-shows referred to their busy schedules. However, many observers noted that the rain check reasons picked by West leaders reflected dissatisfaction of the latter with how Russia's authorities approached the issue of sexual minorities' rights.Moreover, on the eve of the event in Sochi, West media presented a rather gloomy picture of how Russia had prepared for the 2014 Games reporting many alleged cases of corruption, misappropriation of funds, construction delays, and environmental damage caused by the construction. In sum, the outstretched hand of Vladimir Putin hung empty in the air. The Russia leader should have been strongly disappointed at and angry with his West partners. In contrast, China President Xi Jinping, Japan Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, Turkey leader Recep Erdogan, and many other non-West heads of state were happy to join Vladimir Putin for the sporting event in Sochi. This unfortunate incident would probably not be worth mention if it were not for one remarkable coincidence. The 2014 Games coincided with the climax of mutiny and violence in Ukraine. When hockey players were scoring pucks in the Bolshoy Ice Dome in Sochi, protesters were burning car tires at the Independence Square in Kyiv. The situation in Ukraine was getting more and more dangerous with each passing day. I often wonder whether the Ukraine crisis could have taken a different direction should all West leaders have had a chance to discuss its unraveling situation with President Vladimir Putin in an informal way somewhere in a VIP lounge at the Olympic Village in Sochi. Probably, in the friendly and relaxed atmosphere of the grand sport festival, they could had come to a common position that would have prevented further unrest, more bloodshed, and a future protracted fundamental conflict between Moscow and the West. Unfortunately, this opportunity was missed forever.Now, let me get back to the West diplomatic boycott of the 2022 Winter Olympic Games. Just imagine for a second that there is another major international crisis during the Games - for instance, in the Taiwan Straits. Wouldn't it be great for President Xi Jinping, Joe Biden, Vladimir Putin, and other big shots in global politics to discuss the crisis in the casual environment of the Winter Olympic Games? I am almost sure that this environment would be ideal for reaching an acceptable compromise and for avoiding the worst-case outcomes of the crisis. Even without a crisis, a meeting of P5 leaders on the margins of the 2022 Games would be an extremely rare opportunity to compare notes on the situation in the world and to agree on steps promoting global stability and economic recovery. It seems that this opportunity has already been missed as the one missed eight years ago.History tells US that when tension between states grows, the states need more, not less diplomatic interaction. Not sending officials to the Winter Olympic Games in Beijing, West leaders demonstrated a spectacular lack of vision and a deficit of common sense - and neither for the first nor for the last time in modern history. The sad fact is that the mistakes and fumbles of state leaders often impose a heavy toll on societies and nations that these leaders are supposed to serve and protect.         The author is director general of the Russia International Affairs Council. opinion@globaltimes.com.cn",OPINION,VIEWPOINT,"The emblem of Beijing 2022 Olympic Winter Games is unveiled during the emblem launch ceremony for the Beijing 2022 Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games in Bejing, capital of China, Dec. 15, 2017.(Photo: Xinhua)",Author title not found,"Andrey Kortunov, academic director of the Russian International Affairs Council.","{'US': ('LOC', 5), 'China': ('LOC', 3), 'Xinjiang': ('LOC', 1), 'Beijing': ('LOC', 1), 'White House': ('LOC', 1), 'Sochi': ('LOC', 3), 'Russia': ('LOC', 5), 'Black Sea': ('LOC', 1), 'Japan': ('LOC', 1), 'Turkey': ('LOC', 1), 'Winter Olympic Games': ('MISC', 8), 'Paralympics': ('MISC', 1), 'COD': ('MISC', 1), '2014': ('MISC', 1), 'West': ('MISC', 4), 'Joe Biden': ('PER', 1), 'Jen Psaki': ('PER', 1), 'Vladimir Putin': ('PER', 3), 'Barack Obama': ('PER', 1), 'Angela Merkel': ('PER', 1), 'Francois Holland': ('PER', 1), 'David Cameron': ('PER', 1), 'So': ('PER', 1), 'Xi Jin': ('PER', 1), 'Shin': ('PER', 1), 'Abe': ('PER', 1), 'E': ('PER', 1)}"
151,"GT Investigates: Western-style ‘democracy’ losing luster, with China’s political system performing better than US’ in the eyes of the nation’s youth",Yang Sheng,2021-12-12,"

Two young people take a selfie at Tiananmen Square on the morning of October 1, 2021 after the flag-raising ceremony. More than 130,000 people came to the square to celebrate the 72nd anniversary of the founding of the China on the day. Photo: VCGA recent questionnaire survey conducted by the Global Times found that most China young people, especially Generation Z born in the 1990s and 2000s, now view China as more democratic than the US and West political systems, which are no longer considered a ""role model"" of democracy, while US held a ""summit for democracy"" in a vain attempt to keep hold of its monopoly in defining ""democracy."" The survey includes 10 questions about the view of China's Generation Z on democracy and the comparison between the China political system and US political system's performance in realizing democracy for the peoples of the two countries. The survey finds that most participants, who used to believe in West democracy (including a multi-party system, 'one person one vote' and a tripartite structure) is ""the only correct answer of democracy for the world,"" have no longer held this view. Young China people have started to approve of China's political system more than the US ""democratic"" system, as many major events and incidents over past decades, including COVID-19 pandemic, the chaos of US presidential election 2020-21, the US-initiated trade war against China, the immigrant crisis in EU, Brexit, the Global War on Terror, and the turmoil in Hong Kong during 2019, have led to profound changes in their attitudes, according to survey results. When scoring, from 1 to 10, China and the US in comparing ""which country's political system is better,"" the interviewees, on average, gave China a score of 7.5 while the US received a 5. The survey found that 97.2 percent of young China believe that the US' ""summit for democracy"" is unable to save ""US or West democracy"" from the current crisis.The survey, conducted from November 29 to December 8, included 108 interviewees aged 18-33, who are students from universities across the country and also many top universities in developed West countries including the US, the UK and Canada. The survey covered young people who work in industries including finance, energy, transportation, education, trade, IT, medical and health, food, video game development, media, as well as those who serve in the governmental departments and state-owned enterprises. The survey not only sought out interviewees in economically developed first-tier cities like Beijing and Shanghai, and cities like Guangzhou and Shenzhen in Guangdong Province, and adjacent Hong Kong, but also includes those in other provinces and border regions including Zhejiang, Anhui, Henan, Hunan, Hubei, Sichuan, Shanxi, Shaanxi, Fujian, Jilin, Liaoning, Heilongjiang, Inner Mongolia and Xinjiang.

What is democracy? The survey results revealed that most interviewees (53.7 percent) confirm that ""Yes, democracy is a shared value of humanity"" with a minority answering either ""No"" (22.2 percent) or ""Not sure"" (24 percent).Some of those who answered ""No"" and ""Not sure"" in the questionnaire told the Global Times that long-standing perceptions about ""democracy"" from the West and those ""public intellectuals"" in China who seek to undermine China's political system and dilute patriotism among the China people by exaggerating and idealizing the West political system, have made them feel ""disgusted"" when contemplating the term ""democracy.""""Many developing countries in Southeast Asia, Africa, Middle East and Latin US, which follow the West paradigm on 'democracy,' are still suffering from endless chaos and have failed to achieve the development they wanted through endless regime changes and useless elections, so I don't think 'democracy' should be a shared value of humanity,"" said an interviewee from a Beijing-based company aged 24 who asked not to be named.However, here comes a question. ""Which 'democracy' are we talking about? The first one is the value of democracy that is truly shared by the international community, including China; the second one is the West political system; the third one is the so-called universal values that West countries force other countries to follow but which have led to endless chaos, poverty and conflict across the globe. They are totally different,"" Shen Yi, a professor from the School of International Relations and Public Affairs at Fudan University, told Global Times.Another interviewee surnamed Liu, 28, from Anhui Province, said ""if 'democracy' equals the West political system, then I disagree that it should be the value shared by humanity. In China, the word democracy, Min Zhu, consists of two characters - the people and ruling or master. So, if you ask me is  the people should be the masters of their country' a shared value of humanity, then I would say 'yes'.""Analysts said the survey results show that the term ""democracy"" has been defiled by the West, especially the US, since West countries always use their monopoly in defining the term to lecture others, to interfere with non-West countries' internal affairs, and even to create pretexts for military interventions, legitimizing their invasion of many non-West countries.As a result, some  young China have confused ""democracy as the shared value of humanity"" with ""the term used by West countries and West mainstream media outlets frequently in lecturing the rest of the world,"" experts noted, stressing that there are many approaches to reach the goal of democracy, or to let the people truly rule their country and to make sure a government truly serves the interests of its people, and the West political system is just one of many approaches, now many facts are suggesting this approach is not very effective and is quickly losing credibility across the globe, including in the US.When it comes to the definition of ""democracy,"" none of the 108 surveyed consider the West standard should be the universal definition, with 100 of them agreeing that ""every nation and civilization should have its own democratic system based on its own national conditions and culture. As long as the people are the real masters of the country, the social system is supporting the interests of the people, the power of the government is under effective supervision and the power transition of the national leaders based on the law can be realized in order, then the approaches or models for democracy could be diversified, and there should not be only one standard for 'democracy'.""The remaining eight believe China's ""Whole-Process People's Democracy"" is much more relevant than West democracy in defining ""democracy.""The survey showed that 76 (70.3 percent) of the interviewees believe that ""China and the West political systems have their own advantages and disadvantages, so it's hard to say which is better, and both sides should keep learning from each other, rather than attack and disparage each other. They should remain relevant to peoples' lives and engage in continued reform to better serve the public.""

Crumbling US democracy. Illustration: Liu Rui/GTZhang Weiwei, director of the China Institute of Fudan University in Shanghai, told the Global Times, ""If many countries, and people in the world, prefer the West model [of democracy], [and if] US prefer the US model, then we respect your choice, but we do not envy you. To be honest…we have some sympathy for you. You have to improve, otherwise, without reform, it [the West or US model for democracy] will get worse and worse."" A participant in the survey, who is 29 years old and lives in Urumqi,China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, told the Global Times why there is not an option for ""zero"" for scoring US democracy. The US has unveiled all its hypocrisy in recent years by hyping all kinds of lies on the Xinjiang region. ""I don't think the US has any right to say anything about 'democracy' or 'human rights' given its previous slaughter of Native US and the current blatant smearing of Xinjiang,"" said the young man.The survey also finds that some young people from economically developed regions and overseas are more open-minded and neutral when comparing China's and the West's systems, while those from developing border regions like Xinjiang are more assertive in criticizing US or West democracy and more supportive and thankful for China's political system and democracy.   Changing mindsAmong the 108 interviewees, 20 used to believe in the West political system -  one built on characteristics including a multi-party or two-party system, ""one person one vote"" and a tripartite structure to separate powers between the legislature, executive and judiciary - is ""the only correct answer and standard for democracy"" and ""the whole world should learn from the West and flow the West on the matter of democracy.""Only one interviewee among the 20 still maintains this view, and the other COVID-19 have all changed their ""view of democracy,"" according to the survey results.""In the past decades, what critical issues in the international arena have led you to change your view of democracy? Please provide three examples."" On this question, the following three issues were most prevalent: First, the chaos of the 2020-21 US presidential election, which includes the death of George Floyd, the storming of US Capitol Hill and former US president Donald Trump being banned from all US mainstream social media platforms (49 percent). Second, the poor performance of West countries in handling COVID-19 pandemic which has led to a huge number of deaths, and the US recklessly blaming China, as well as an unfair vaccine allocation policy (42.6 percent), and third, the US-launched Global War on Terror that has caused destructive wars and a huge number of civilian casualties in Iraq and Afghanistan over the past 20 years (33.3 percent).    Some interviewees provided their own answers about the question, such as the Ukraine crisis, the tragedies which occurred after the ""Arab Spring,"" Brexit, the rise of Trumpism in the US, and the immigrant crisis in EU. ""After watching the UK TV series Yes, Prime Minster, I found West democracy is truly unreliable and hilarious. We should never choose it for governing our own country,"" said Su Muzhe, 22, an interviewee from North China's Shanxi Province.Away from focusing on critical issues occurring abroad, another survey question asked that, ""What critical issues that happened in China over the past one or two decades have changed your view of 'democracy'? Please provide three examples."" In other words, how has China won your approval over the West? Most interviewees nominated China's successful handling over COVID-19 epidemic (78.7 percent), which was strong proof of the efficiency of the China system and showed that the Communist Party of China's (CPC) prioritizes people's lives and interests, as always. Across the surveyed group, 44 of the 108 interviewees (40.7 percent) picked ""the CPC's long-standing and effective anti-corruption campaign following the 18th National Congress of the CPC."" Several interviewees reflected that the campaign addressed the long-existing corruption problem and witnessed the CPC's determination to eliminate corruption permanently. The political environment in China has improved greatly following this campaign, many noted.A total of 40 (37 percent) interviewees picked China's determined response to the US-initiated trade war against China over recent years, as this proves that the CPC will not compromise when it comes to bullies and is able to protect the country's national interests, especially China's right to seek out its own development pathway. It also proved that China is a country which is capable of saying ""No"" to the only superpower in the world, while many other countries are unable to resist US intimidation.An interviewee surnamed Lan, from Southwest China's Sichuan Province, said that ""the post-disaster rescue and reconstruction of Wenchuan after the 512 Earthquake in 2008 is also a significant example. This has greatly strengthened our support and approval for the CPC, especially for the people in Sichuan. We found the system of our country is able to unify and organize forces across the country to come to save and aid people during a disaster or crisis. We truly appreciate this."" Wenchuan, a county located in the northwest of Sichuan, was devastated on May 12, 2008 by an earthquake of 8.0 on the Richter magnitude, causing the tragic death of 69,227 people and injuring much more. Some other interviewees also said the turmoil in Hong Kong in 2019 has also changed their view on democracy, because they found without order and strong law-enforcement, hostile foreign forces and internal secessionists working with anti-government forces would have chance to inflict serious damage on the country's stability and national security. They said they saw the strength of the socialist system in the mainland following the central government's handling of the violent unrest in Hong Kong.

And they have also witnessed the increasing failure and chaos across the West world. They represent the most confident generation of the China people and they cannot be fooled by West propaganda when it comes to 'democracy'.""If the US honestly admits its mistakes and shows its determination to implement the much-needed reform, and offers praise to other non-West countries like China when other countries have outperformed the US, like with the fight against COVID-19, instead of maintaining a posture of arrogance and insistence on being right every time, then the US would still have hope to make its 'democracy' more popular among China youth again,"" he noted.",CHINA,POLITICS,Democracy in the eyes of Generation Z.

152,Note to Sullivan: You are dragging US down by talking big: Global Times editorial,Global Times,2021-12-09,"US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said on Tuesday, ""from the point of view of both deterrence and diplomacy,"" the US is going to take every action it can to make sure that the reunification of the China mainland with the island of Taiwan by force ""never happens."" He made these remarks when responding to a question whether the US is prepared to deal with the situation in the Taiwan Straits and in Ukraine. Sullivan also mentioned that the US' ""efforts"" during the past eight months in the Indo-Pacific region were to avoid ""any kind of scenario where China chooses to invade.""Recently, US senior officials have repeatedly shown their tough yet empty attitude on the situation in the Taiwan Straits. On Tuesday, US Secretary of State Anthony Antony Blinken also accused China of attempting to ""reshape not only its own territory but also the global system to its benefit."" Again, Antony Blinken threatened that ""if Beijing were to decide to try to change the status quo unilaterally by force, it would be a very serious mistake.""Sullivan blustered to ensure that China's reunification by force ""never happens,"" which is particularly alarming. This is the biggest boast made by a senior US official so far. Almost no one would believe Sullivan's impromptu to a reporter would become a manifesto of US policy. This is because the US simply cannot build a deterrent to prevent the China mainland from carrying out reunification by force when necessary. No one would believe the US has the true will to defend Taiwan at all costs, which goes against China's military growth and its resolution in reunification.So far, the official attitude of US is to encourage the Taiwan authority to build up self-defense capabilities. The US mainly provides military support to Taiwan by selling weapons. Those weapons are generally destined to be destroyed by the People's Liberation Army (PLA) as soon as the reunification by force takes place. It is credible that the PLA will heavily attack US troops who come to Taiwan's rescue. Such credibility is increasingly overwhelming the deterrence that US troops may have.We do not believe Sullivan will repeatedly reiterate his attitude of ensuring that reunification by force ""will never happen."" It is very likely that he will recall or downplay this statement because the US cannot afford the responsibility and pressure of making this official. The US is far away from ""defending Taiwan"" at the cost of a deadly war.Indeed, the US does have a way of ensuring that reunification by force ""never happens."" That is to blow the ambitions of the Taiwan authority to promote the ""Taiwan independence,"" to force them to return to the 1992 Consensus and meet half way with the China mainland on the path of peaceful reunification and to accept the principle of ""one country, two systems."" If US supports the Taiwan authority's path of seeking secession and encourages the Taiwan authority to rely on it, then reunification by force will definitely happen. The more the US and the island of Taiwan collude, the sooner reunification by force will come.The China mainland has the will to maintain peace and stability across the Taiwan Straits. However, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) authority has rejected the one-China principle after it took office in 2016, which severely undermined the political foundation of cross-Straits relations and pushed the situation in the Taiwan Straits toward serious instability. Currently, people are talking about military confrontations in the Taiwan Straits very frequently, something that was unimaginable a few years ago. The key elements and mechanisms have all changed. Perhaps the critical point of turning back has already passed.To avoid a showdown in the Taiwan Straits, the DPP authority must retreat in big steps and the US should urge it to return to the right track when it gets lost. If the US continues to regard the Taiwan island as a pawn to contain the China mainland and send wrong signals to the DPP authority, then the situation will keep on worsening. Resolving the Taiwan question by force will become the inevitable and only choice for the China mainland.Mr Sullivan, please be advised to sort out your mind carefully and think about what bargaining chips you do have in your hands to intimidate the China mainland which is determined to achieve national reunification and has various strategic tools to resist blackmail. You will find your hands empty. Therefore, don't have a big mouth, Mr Sullivan, otherwise you will only create more embarrassment for your country.",OPINION,EDITORIAL,US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan Photo: AFP,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'US': ('LOC', 16), 'China': ('LOC', 6), 'Taiwan': ('LOC', 6), 'Taiwan Straits': ('LOC', 8), 'Ukraine': ('LOC', 1), 'Indo - Pacific': ('LOC', 1), 'Beijing': ('LOC', 1), 'Jake Sullivan': ('PER', 5), 'Anthony Antony Blinken': ('PER', 1), 'Antony Blinken': ('PER', 1), 'Liberation Army': ('ORG', 1), 'PLA': ('ORG', 2)}"
153,"US, Russia clashes to continue after ‘candid, tough-toned’ Putin-Biden meeting",GT staff reporters,2021-12-09,"In what analysts described as a ""candid and tough-toned"" video meeting between Russia President Vladimir Putin and US President Joe Biden, it ended with a US caveat of Russia on the Ukraine issue. Analysts warned that the US should be cautious of turning those threats into action, as Russia is unlikely to concede over this core-interest issue that threatens its national security, and that any provocative move from US and its NATO allies will eventually backfire. Faced with the US crackdown, the bond between China and Russia has grown stronger than ever, as the two countries unwaveringly support each other on many fronts, said experts. They said that such a ""support of each other's core interests"" embodies true friendship, which defies the US Cold War mentality, unilateralism and selfishness. During a two-hour video call, Joe Biden told the Russia leader that the US would send defensive materiel to Ukraine ""above and beyond"" what the US already has sent if Russia invades, National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan told reporters. Joe Biden also threatened ""strong economic measures"" in case of an attack, Bloomberg reported.  Vladimir Putin pushed back, blaming NATO for the increase in tensions through its ""dangerous efforts"" to expand ties with Kyiv and ratchet up its military potential on Russia's borders, the Kremlin said in a statement that described the talks as ""frank and businesslike,"" according to the report. The Russia president reiterated that Moscow wants binding security guarantees that the US-led alliance won't take in new members to the east or station offensive weapons close to Russia, said the report.  The virtual meeting between Joe Biden and Vladimir Putin was their fourth this year, including a face-to-face meeting in Geneva. Analysts said that this meeting attracted wide attention, but was not expected to yield concrete results as the divergence between the two countries over core-interest issues, such as the Ukraine crisis and Iran is too deep to be fixed during the meeting.As on the Ukraine question, the two sides drew redlines for each other, and there's no sign of playing down the question, Yang Jin, an associate research fellow at the Institute of Russia, EU and Central Asia Studies under the China Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times, noting that ""US reiterated its stance of safeguarding the security interests of its NATO partners while ensuring weapons supplies to Ukraine,"" he said, explaining that all these pledges are the redlines of Kremlin. Yet for Russia, NATO's expansion to the east or Ukraine's NATO bid poses a severe threat to Russia's national security, said Yang, noting that Russia is unlikely to make any concession on the Ukraine question. ""We could not exclude the possibility that Russia would take tougher measures in ensuring its national security and regional security, and a fierce struggle between the US and Russia is expected to continue,"" he said.  The Wall Street Journal reported in January that NATO has deployed four battle groups—nearly 5,000 troops—to Poland and the Baltic states of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. In addition to military threats, US Undersecretary of State Victoria Nuland said in a briefing Tuesday on Capitol Hill that the US is ready to isolate ""Russia completely from the global financial system with all of the fallout that it would entail for Russia business, for the Russia people, for their ability to work and travel and trade.""It is very dangerous for the US to take any provocative moves on Ukraine, as it will face a tough test and severe consequences if Russia and Ukraine engage in a military conflict, Lü Xiang, a research fellow at the China Academy of Social Sciences in Beijing, told the Global Times.Despite the meeting being filled with the ""smell of gunpowder,"" experts said the meeting helped each side exchange views ""in a candid way"" as tensions between Russia and the West rise. Speaking at a Wednesday briefing, Wang Wenbin, spokesperson of China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said that China is willing to see Russia and the US conduct dialogue and improve relations, which is beneficial to world peace and development. Targeting two at the same timeUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Sullivan turned the muzzle to China and Russia together, with Antony Blinken saying at a Tuesday forum that attempts by China or Russia to expand their territory by ""invasions"" of Taiwan or Ukraine, respectively, would be serious mistakes with severe consequences. On the question of whether the US is prepared to deal with a Russia ""invasion"" of Ukraine and simultaneous China ""aggression toward"" the island of Taiwan, Sullivan said  in a briefing  that the US is taking measures to prevent such situations. ""The US is going to take every action that we can take, from the point of view of both deterrence and diplomacy, to make sure that the Taiwan scenario...never happens and to try to avert the invasion and deter the invasion of Ukraine. That is the object of our policy right now,"" he said.US lawmakers urged efforts to push back against Russia and China in a compromise version of a massive annual defense bill released on Tuesday, proposing $300 million for Ukraine's military and a statement of support for the defense of Taiwan, Reuters reported. For a long time, especially since Vladimir Putin's power in Russia has been consolidated, the US has identified China and Russia as its two most crucial strategic targets for containment. On account of the concerns of US, they want to retain the ability to interfere in internal affairs of other countries, while China and Russia are probably the only two countries who are willing, and more importantly, capable of protecting their sovereignty, experts said. Joe Biden called the leaders of France, Italy, the UK and Germany to brief them on the conversations he had with Vladimir Putin. He's expected to speak with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskiy on Thursday, Sullivan said. Experts said that marshalling allies is a common tactic used by US to confront its adversaries such as China and Russia, because the US is aware of its powerlessness to challenge those two countries singlehandedly. Yet such tactics also have many flaws. On tackling Russia, the US and its allies are at odds on the Nord Stream 2 natural gas pipeline, a route to sell more gas to EU from Russia; and on China, the US allies also have concerns because they do not want to be forced in an ""US-or-them"" situation, experts said.  The US is unable to contain China and Russia simultaneously, and yet targeting one means the other will go further and pose a bigger threat to US, said Lü, noting that from a strategic level, the US deems Russia as a more ""imminent"" threat, and tends to take more drastic actions. ""The US is still torn between making decisions on both countries,"" said the expert. Friends in needYet because both face reckless US crackdowns, the relationship between China and Russia has reached a decade high, Lü said. He noted that China and Russia have a huge potential to develop political mutual trust and economic cooperation, which will give each other a huge boost. Contrary to what some US politicians and scholars believe, Russia should never be considered insignificant as it is still one of the most important players in international geopolitics.In recent years, Beijing and Moscow have stepped up cooperation on many fronts, be they military, trade or people-to-people exchanges. During the first 10 months of this year, trade reached $115.6 billion, or over 30 percent higher than the same period last year. Before the year end, it is expected to reach a new high, China Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said at a routine press conference last week. On military cooperation, the two countries recently signed a roadmap for closer ties, which, according to military experts, indicates that Russia and China have common interests and views on strategic stability and regional security, especially in the Pacific region. China is unwaveringly backing Russia's stance on many international affairs, such as the Iran nuclear deal, and the Afghan issue. Officials from China and Russia have participated in many meetings to solve the Afghan issue, and called on the international community to provide assistance to this war-torn country, after it descended into chaos because of the hasty US withdrawal.Russia is also unwaveringly standing with China when the latter faces smears from West countries. For example, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters on Tuesday that ""Our position is that the Winter Olympic Games should be free of politics"" in reference to the US for its diplomatic boycott of the 2022 Winter Olympic Games. Vladimir Putin is also expected to attend the Winter Olympic Games in Beijing,Observers said that when multilateralism and globalization are gradually damaged by the US attempt to use its own definition of international order and universal values to manipulate and discipline other countries to expand its hegemony, that's why it is important for China and Russia to speak out to break its monopoly on narratives and rule-making, to push the democratization of international relations.""The current cooperative approaches between China and Russia which focus on cooperation rather than alliance are more rational and pragmatic,"" Cui Heng, an assistant research fellow from the Center for Russia Studies of China Normal University, told the Global Times.""If China establishes a defensive alliance with Russia, it will inevitably accelerate the outbreak of a new Cold War. For China and Russia, the US' ambitions can be curtailed to some extent by joining forces on diplomacy and security through close, non-aligned strategic coordination,"" said Cui.
In what analysts described as a ""candid and tough-toned"" video meeting between Russia President Vladimir Putin and US President Joe Biden, it ended with a US caveat of Russia on the Ukraine issue. Analysts warned that the US should be cautious of turning those threats into action, as Russia is unlikely to concede over this core-interest issue that threatens its national security, and that any provocative move from US and its NATO allies will eventually backfire. Faced with the US crackdown, the bond between China and Russia has grown stronger than ever, as the two countries unwaveringly support each other on many fronts, said experts. They said that such a ""support of each other's core interests"" embodies true friendship, which defies the US Cold War mentality, unilateralism and selfishness. During a two-hour video call, Joe Biden told the Russia leader that the US would send defensive materiel to Ukraine ""above and beyond"" what the US already has sent if Russia invades, National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan told reporters. Joe Biden also threatened ""strong economic measures"" in case of an attack, Bloomberg reported.  Vladimir Putin pushed back, blaming NATO for the increase in tensions through its ""dangerous efforts"" to expand ties with Kyiv and ratchet up its military potential on Russia's borders, the Kremlin said in a statement that described the talks as ""frank and businesslike,"" according to the report. The Russia president reiterated that Moscow wants binding security guarantees that the US-led alliance won't take in new members to the east or station offensive weapons close to Russia, said the report.  The virtual meeting between Joe Biden and Vladimir Putin was their fourth this year, including a face-to-face meeting in Geneva. Analysts said that this meeting attracted wide attention, but was not expected to yield concrete results as the divergence between the two countries over core-interest issues, such as the Ukraine crisis and Iran is too deep to be fixed during the meeting.As on the Ukraine question, the two sides drew redlines for each other, and there's no sign of playing down the question, Yang Jin, an associate research fellow at the Institute of Russia, EU and Central Asia Studies under the China Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times, noting that ""US reiterated its stance of safeguarding the security interests of its NATO partners while ensuring weapons supplies to Ukraine,"" he said, explaining that all these pledges are the redlines of Kremlin. Yet for Russia, NATO's expansion to the east or Ukraine's NATO bid poses a severe threat to Russia's national security, said Yang, noting that Russia is unlikely to make any concession on the Ukraine question. ""We could not exclude the possibility that Russia would take tougher measures in ensuring its national security and regional security, and a fierce struggle between the US and Russia is expected to continue,"" he said.  The Wall Street Journal reported in January that NATO has deployed four battle groups—nearly 5,000 troops—to Poland and the Baltic states of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. In addition to military threats, US Undersecretary of State Victoria Nuland said in a briefing Tuesday on Capitol Hill that the US is ready to isolate ""Russia completely from the global financial system with all of the fallout that it would entail for Russia business, for the Russia people, for their ability to work and travel and trade.""It is very dangerous for the US to take any provocative moves on Ukraine, as it will face a tough test and severe consequences if Russia and Ukraine engage in a military conflict, Lü Xiang, a research fellow at the China Academy of Social Sciences in Beijing, told the Global Times.Despite the meeting being filled with the ""smell of gunpowder,"" experts said the meeting helped each side exchange views ""in a candid way"" as tensions between Russia and the West rise. Speaking at a Wednesday briefing, Wang Wenbin, spokesperson of China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said that China is willing to see Russia and the US conduct dialogue and improve relations, which is beneficial to world peace and development. Targeting two at the same timeUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Sullivan turned the muzzle to China and Russia together, with Antony Blinken saying at a Tuesday forum that attempts by China or Russia to expand their territory by ""invasions"" of Taiwan or Ukraine, respectively, would be serious mistakes with severe consequences. On the question of whether the US is prepared to deal with a Russia ""invasion"" of Ukraine and simultaneous China ""aggression toward"" the island of Taiwan, Sullivan said  in a briefing  that the US is taking measures to prevent such situations. ""The US is going to take every action that we can take, from the point of view of both deterrence and diplomacy, to make sure that the Taiwan scenario...never happens and to try to avert the invasion and deter the invasion of Ukraine. That is the object of our policy right now,"" he said.US lawmakers urged efforts to push back against Russia and China in a compromise version of a massive annual defense bill released on Tuesday, proposing $300 million for Ukraine's military and a statement of support for the defense of Taiwan, Reuters reported. For a long time, especially since Vladimir Putin's power in Russia has been consolidated, the US has identified China and Russia as its two most crucial strategic targets for containment. On account of the concerns of US, they want to retain the ability to interfere in internal affairs of other countries, while China and Russia are probably the only two countries who are willing, and more importantly, capable of protecting their sovereignty, experts said. Joe Biden called the leaders of France, Italy, the UK and Germany to brief them on the conversations he had with Vladimir Putin. He's expected to speak with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskiy on Thursday, Sullivan said. Experts said that marshalling allies is a common tactic used by US to confront its adversaries such as China and Russia, because the US is aware of its powerlessness to challenge those two countries singlehandedly. Yet such tactics also have many flaws. On tackling Russia, the US and its allies are at odds on the Nord Stream 2 natural gas pipeline, a route to sell more gas to EU from Russia; and on China, the US allies also have concerns because they do not want to be forced in an ""US-or-them"" situation, experts said.  The US is unable to contain China and Russia simultaneously, and yet targeting one means the other will go further and pose a bigger threat to US, said Lü, noting that from a strategic level, the US deems Russia as a more ""imminent"" threat, and tends to take more drastic actions. ""The US is still torn between making decisions on both countries,"" said the expert. Friends in needYet because both face reckless US crackdowns, the relationship between China and Russia has reached a decade high, Lü said. He noted that China and Russia have a huge potential to develop political mutual trust and economic cooperation, which will give each other a huge boost. Contrary to what some US politicians and scholars believe, Russia should never be considered insignificant as it is still one of the most important players in international geopolitics.In recent years, Beijing and Moscow have stepped up cooperation on many fronts, be they military, trade or people-to-people exchanges. During the first 10 months of this year, trade reached $115.6 billion, or over 30 percent higher than the same period last year. Before the year end, it is expected to reach a new high, China Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said at a routine press conference last week. On military cooperation, the two countries recently signed a roadmap for closer ties, which, according to military experts, indicates that Russia and China have common interests and views on strategic stability and regional security, especially in the Pacific region. China is unwaveringly backing Russia's stance on many international affairs, such as the Iran nuclear deal, and the Afghan issue. Officials from China and Russia have participated in many meetings to solve the Afghan issue, and called on the international community to provide assistance to this war-torn country, after it descended into chaos because of the hasty US withdrawal.Russia is also unwaveringly standing with China when the latter faces smears from West countries.

154,Whose development does US democracy serve?,Xin Ping,2021-12-09,"Flashback to the 1950s, when CIA director Allan Dulles made a stirring recount of the Soviet Union's ""mental warfare"" during the Cold War. ""The human mind is the most delicate of all instruments. It is so finely adjusted, so susceptible to outside influences that it is proving a malleable tool in the hands of sinister men."" Three days after the speech, Dulles approved a top-secret CIA program for the ""covert use of biological and chemical materials."" Although ""US values"" made for good rhetoric, it was in fact a part of the brainwashing agenda. The specter from the Cold War still haunts the world. The ambition to shape others to the US' liking has never changed, except for potentially less subtlety and scruples. Since the late 1980s, the US has been imposing its self-styled democracy onto countries through the ""Color Revolution"" in Eurasia, ""Arab Spring"" in North Africa and the Middle East, and New Monroe Doctrine in Latin US, to name just a few. Political meddling, military intervention and regime change are among the many cards held up US sleeves, all of which have deprived countries of their right to development. For the US, other countries are no more than ""guinea pigs"" in their ""democratic experiment."" And the outcome, with more failure than success, is to be stomached by the recipients themselves. Regime changes often flared up in the former Soviet republics. The ""Rose Revolution"" in Georgia, ""Tulip Revolution"" in Kyrgyzstan, ""Orange Revolution"" in Ukraine, among others, were stirred up by external forces such as the US State Department, which was frank about its central role in fulfilling its president's pledge to spread democracy and end ""tyranny"" worldwide. In September this year, Russia protested against the US for the latter's suspected interference in the State Duma's election. When local people are satisfied with their own governments, the US cannot wait to replace them with their preferred alternatives, resulting in pre-election chaos, disruption of social order, and ultimately, serious blows to local economies and livelihoods. No development whatsoever. The US hand in the ""Arab Spring"" sent even greater shock waves, which still linger and hurt to this day. In 2011, the New York Times revealed that US-government-sponsored organizations promoted US democracy in regional countries, in total disregard of national realities and development models. The spearheading entities and personnel were trained and funded by the International Republican Institute, National Democratic Institute, Freedom House and the like. But their bubbles burst quickly. Just two years after the ""democratic revolution"" in Tunisia, locals were dismayed by the reality. According to the Pew Research Center, 72 percent of Tunisians were dissatisfied with how their democracy was working, including 42 percent who said they were not at all satisfied. Kidnapping local people's aspirations for better governance has taken much more brutal form. The wars in Libya, Syria and Afghanistan wreaked havoc despite being waged in the name of promoting democracy. In 2010, Libya was the wealthiest country in Africa according to the World Bank and IMF statistics. A decade later, its per capita income shrank to less than a third of what it was, nearly 1 million people needed humanitarian assistance and 5.6 million people lost their homes. The Syrian War killed more than 400,000 people. More than 1.5 million were disabled and 2.5 million children dropped out of school as a result. The more than 6 million refugees formed the largest group of the kind in the world. Such tragedy was the last thing anyone would hope for. Yet, it was forced upon by the US, which ironically calls itself the ""beacon of democracy.""The US doesn't care if its democratic trials overseas are successful. Therefore, the question becomes: What does it want? The plight of Latin US even till this day may offer some inspiration. The US uprooted governments that didn't follow its commands, and ""cut the veins"" of others that failed to bow to its power. Land, resources, labor and markets were all harnessed to serve US hegemony. Some Latin US countries dedicated their entire national economy to one particular sector, be it planting, mining or others. They were thus shackled into an economic structure designed by the US. The Monroe Doctrine in 1823 gained a new lease of life centuries later. In a globalized world, what follows the arrival of democracy is in fact the opposite to development - destruction at the hands of the US.The latest Pew research found that only 17 percent of those surveyed worldwide say democracy in the US is a good example for others to follow. Another 23 percent don't believe it has ever been a good model. Even 8 percent of US said they don't believe that their country has ever been such an example. Besides, nearly half of respondents in 53 countries polled by the Alliance of Democracies Foundation are concerned that the US threatens their country's own internal democracy.Former CIA director Mike Pompeo advertised another CIA mantra when he said, ""We lied, we cheated, we stole."" Indeed. Using the disguise of democracy, the US tricks others to believe in ""democracy's"" effect on their development, buts hides its sole purpose of exploitation and consolidation of US dominance. But the US political circle should not fancy themselves smart. President Abraham Lincoln himself warned, ""You cannot fool all the people, all the time.""The author is a commentator on international affairs, writing regularly for Global Times, CGTN, etc..

155,India does not distance itself from Russia to please the US,Long Xingchun,2021-12-07,"Russia President Vladimir Putin visited India on Monday. He held a one-on-one meeting with India Prime Minister Narendra Modi before the 21st India-Russia summit. It is reported that the two countries will hold the first 2+2 ministerial dialogue in New Delhi to discuss pivotal bilateral, regional, and international issues. India Ministry of External Affairs spokesperson Arindam Bagchi said, ""The establishment of this new mechanism of [the] two plus two dialogue is expected to further strengthen the strategic partnership between the two countries.""In mid-November, Russia started supplying S-400 air defense systems to India. The deal of purchase was concluded in 2018, since when US has spared no effort to hinder the deal and warned of sanctions on New Delhi. But India ignored US warnings and adhered to the deal struck with Russia. This being the case, will the US sanction India? How will it affect US-India relations since the two have been getting closer in recent years?The main purpose of India's move closer toward the US is to counter China rather than as a cold shoulder to Russia. Due to a growing gap in national strength and military power, India began to see China as its biggest threat and main geopolitical competitor. It fears that China will resort to using force to settle territorial disputes with it. New Delhi is clear that it cannot stand up to China by itself and has therefore turned to US for support.India said it is a like-minded partner of the US-led West. But it didn't follow the West's lead in criticizing Russia over issues related to Crimea and Ukraine. India has a traditional friendship with Russia dating back to the Soviet era. Russia still remains as the main supplier of weapons to India. In addition, given India's balancing act of diplomacy, New Delhi will not distance itself from Moscow for the sake of catering to US.India is aware that what the US demands from it comes at a price. The first purpose of the US is to prevent India's purchase of S-400 air defense missiles from Russia in order to capitalize upon the India arms market and seek economic benefit. After the Cold War, India became the world's leading arms importer, with sources expanding from Russia to the US, France, the UK and Israel, among others. However, the US wants to gradually replace Russia-made weapons with US-made alternatives in the India weapons systems in order to monopolize the India weapons market in the future.Second, for the purpose of confronting China, the US wants India to completely fall in line and be subservient like Australia, the UK, and Canada. It wants to strategically control India by becoming dominant or even guaranteeing itself as the only supplier of weapons to make New Delhi dependent on US. India's tilting toward the US has sparked concern and discontent from Russia. It is wishful thinking for India to presumably take a free ride on the US in containing China. The quasi-alliance between India and the US is dominated by the latter - India can barely maintain its autonomy in this regard. Thus, Russia can hardly believe that India will stand by it if the US forces India to pick a side. As a counter measure, Russia has strengthened its relations with Pakistan in recent years, not only by supplying arms, but also by conducting joint military exercises, to sound the alarm on India. Except for the Quad Leaders' Summit, the US-India 2+2 Ministerial Dialogues, and superficial joint military exercises, India has gained very limited benefits from the US. US doesn't grant preferential tariff treatment, discounts in arms sales, or any help to India in its pursuit of permanent membership in the UN. Instead, the US has ignored India's right to development and has made excessive demands on India on climate issues, despite India's impoverished situation. The so-called China threat, the main reason for India to stand with the US, however, remains an illusion of India politicians. China, Russia, and India issued a joint communiqué at the 18th Meeting of the Foreign Ministers on November 26. The communiqué includes 35 points of consensus covering a wide range of global and regional matters. It can be seen that the shared bilateral and trilateral interests among the three countries far exceed those between India and the US. This might be the reason why India is swinging back in terms of diplomacy. The author is a senior research fellow with the Academy of Regional and Global Governance at the Beijing Foreign Studies University and the president of the Chengdu Institute of World Affairs. opinion@globaltimes.com.cn",OPINION,VIEWPOINT,"Russian President Vladimir Putin and India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi hold a meeting at Hyderabad House in New Delhi on December 6, 2021.

156,WTO entry a milestone for China: Yiwu traders,Xie Jun,2021-12-07,"Even 20 years after China joined the World Trade Organization (WTO), Shi Xinyu, a veteran trader based in Yiwu, China's small commodity hub located in China's Zhejiang Province, clearly remembers the impact brought by the event on his business. In 2001 when China joined the WTO, Shi was selling ornaments in China's Guangzhou through both retail and wholesale channels. ""My impression was that foreigners suddenly swarmed into China to purchase stuff, and overseas orders were swarming in, partially because China products were too good and inexpensive for foreign buyers then,"" he said. He still can recall an interesting anecdote at that time, when a client from Turkey asked him via translator about how much the bracelets he was selling cost. ""I answered him 0.2. He asked: $0.2? I said 0.2 yuan ($0.03). The translator later told me: if you say $0.2, it's absolutely OK with the client.""Back in his hometown of Yiwu, going into the trade business also become a popular path for locals. ""When I asked what my friends did, around seven out of 10 said they were in the trade business,"" he said. ""It seemed strange if one did not have several foreign friends at that time.""Shi's anecdotes are a window into the changes which took place in China after the country joined the WTO. For cities like Yiwu, although being part of the WTO might not be the start of their journey in developing from a backward town into a modern trade hub, it was definitely an accelerator for the transformation. Currently, even with challenges like the coronavirus, China's foreign trade remains resilient and dynamic.  In November, China's exports surged 22 percent in US dollar terms on a yearly basis, while imports rose by 31.7 percent, according to data published by China customs on Tuesday. 

China's 20 years in the WTO Graphic: Feng Qingyin/GTLearn and grow Joining the WTO was a milestone event in the development of China's overseas trade-led economy, and it provided significant momentum for the government to implement reforms on trade rules that helped China goods meet standards in overseas markets. According to a report by the People's Daily in 2005, China fulfilled most of its WTO obligations in only four years after joining the body. The reforms included relaxing foreign trade management rights and cutting import tariffs.  By the end of 2005, China's average tariff level dropped to 9.9 percent from 15.3 percent before 2001. China also scrapped import quotas and certificate management requirements for hundreds of products. The impact of the reforms on transforming China cities was obvious for all to see. ""The city of Yiwu is a typical example of benefitting from WTO entry, as it developed from a town in the mountains to a global trading hub. Guangzhou and Shanghai were considered export-oriented cities, but the WTO entry enhanced their strengths and become the regional headquarters for many international companies,"" Zheng Lei, chief economist at Glory Sun Financial Group, told the Global Times. Many costal China cities have evolved to embrace the shift towards manufacturing centers, such as Shenzhen, Hangzhou, Ningbo and Dongguan. ""In fact, half of China's economic output after 2000 had something to do with the WTO access,"" Zheng said. For businessmen, the most tangible benefit brought by the WTO entry is that they had more orders from overseas markets. Zhang Jiying, a veteran umbrella seller in Yiwu who has been trading since 1998, said she sensed an ""evident increase"" in overseas clients after China joined the WTO.""When I first started business, my clients were mostly from Pakistan and Afghanistan. But around 2005, EU clients started to increase. Also, the procedures of dealing with overseas clients became simpler after China's entry to the WTO,"" she told the Global Times. Shi said that in the first few years after China joined the WTO, it was very common to run into foreign buyers in Yiwu. Many overseas clients came to explore centralized procurement, and they would purchase thousands of products at once. 

China's 20 years in the WTO Graphic: Feng Qingyin/GTFrom exports to imports Over the years, China has taken managed steps to open up its market after 2001, and the reforms have also helped transform Yiwu, turning the city into an all-around trade center with imports and exports both thriving. According to Zhang, her business was at its peak around 2014, boosted by the growth of clients from many countries. ""Because China initiated the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) in 2013, trade with countries along the route was growing fast. My company saw rising orders from countries like Russia and Ukraine. I feel that China's access to the WTO complemented the BRI very well,"" she said. Entry to the WTO also boosted China's imports, which experts said not only drives economic growth for trading partners, but also helped stablize global commodity prices.""In particular, China has become a major consumer in bulk commodities like ores and agricultural produce, which brought staggering benefits to countries like Brazil and Australia,"" Zheng said. Yiwu's imports business just exploded on this wave of new market access. In 2008, the Yiwu International Trade City opened its imports hall, and Shi's shop, which sells furniture and handicraft, was among the first group of merchants to enter the new business.""When I started the import business, many of the products I imported had never been inspected by customs, and officials then were confused about import standards. For example, they hesitated over whether to define my handicraft lamps as electric appliances or as craft goods. If they were defined as electric appliances, they must meet the government's 3C certificates, which is very hard for a Vietnam manufacturer. But luckily officials were pragmatic and solved the problem in the most appropriate way,"" Shi said. He also noted that as China's imports industry has become increasingly mature, lists of imports also grew to be more standardized. Currently, there are hundreds of import companies based in the Yiwu International Trade City. Through the years of development, the role of Yiwu as global small commodity trade hub has been strengthened to such an extent that it can support global supply chains in difficult times such as the coronavirus pandemic.In the first seven months of 2021, Yiwu's trade volume hit 200 billion yuan, up 17.8 percent year-on-year, Yiwu customs data showed. Local businesspeople told the Global Times that although their business has taken some hits from the pandemic, they still have confidence in the city's future development prospects. ""I feel honored to witness the development of Yiwu after joining the WTO. Although it's not convenient for overseas businesspeople to visit China now because of the pandemic, I believe clients will continue to come to Yiwu after domestic and global situation becomes more stable,"" Zhang said.",SOURCE,COMPANIES,"Foreign online celebrities visit the Yiwu International Trade Market in East China's Zhejiang Province on June 7, 2021.

157,"US Reportedly Mulls Cutting Russia Off SWIFT, Sanctioning Energy Producers & 'Putin's Inner Circle",sputniknews,2021-12-07," Previously, the US president promised to make it ""very, very difficult"" for Vladimir Putin to attack Ukraine amid continuing allegations in the press and at the White House that Moscow is planning an offensive against Kiev. The Kremlin has strongly rejected these claims, vowing it poses no threat to any state.Joe Biden administration officials are considering a wide array of options for possible sanctions against Russia to deter it from an alleged plan to invade Ukraine, CNN has reported, citing anonymous sources. The potential options reportedly include sanctions against undefined ""members of Vladimir Putin's inner circle"", Russia energy companies, and banks. Russia’s sovereign debt might also be targeted, the sources claimed.According to CNN, the White House also considered a potential ""nuclear option"" – cutting Russia off SWIFT – a worldwide system of inter-bank communications that are used in international money wires and transactions. The US applied a similar measure against Iran under the presidency of Donald Trump, making it difficult for the country to trade with other members of the international community.""We have put together a pretty damn aggressive package"", one official told CNN.No final decision has been made on the sanctions package that could be implemented in the event of a Russia invasion of Ukraine, CNN said. The White House is reportedly discussing punitive measures with its EU partners, who are more tightly connected to the Russia economy, to coordinate action. The EU Parliament passed a motion earlier this year containing a ""nuclear option"" similar to the one being mulled in the White House.At the same time, the Joe Biden administration fears potential repercussions of slapping Moscow with hefty sanctions, specifically in the energy sector. Many EU states rely on gas supplies from Russia amid spiking prices and under-filled gas reserves. Moscow also became the second biggest oil exporter to the US in 2021 and remains one of the biggest suppliers of diesel for the country. The latter helps keep the soaring fuel prices in check.""The fear is Russia then tries to retaliate by holding back production"", an unidentified senior US official told CNN.The Kremlin has repeatedly publicly denied the possibility of using its energy resources as a geopolitical tool of pressure. However, it is unclear how either the US or EU countries even plan to buy the available Russia gas, oil, and fuel with the country's banks cut off from the SWIFT system and thus unable to receive payments.US May Support Eastern NATO Allies if Russia 'Invades Ukraine'A senior US official has briefed the press ahead of the upcoming video call between US President Joe Biden and President Vladimir Putin, noting that POTUS will raise the issue of Ukraine during the conversation and will warn his Russia counterpart of severe consequences if Moscow attacks its neighbour. Joe Biden will not engage in a ""rhetorical flourish or finger-wagging"" and will instead plainly explain to Vladimir Putin what the US is ready to undertake in respect to deterrence and diplomacy, the person said.The official stressed that the US does not seek a conflict with Russia and does not see a scenario where its armed forces would be used in an allegedly possible Russia-Ukraine conflict. The administration representative stressed, however, that US will respond harshly and jointly with its EU partners if Moscow invades Ukraine.""President Joe Biden will obviously raise our concerns with Russia’s military buildup and plans with respect to Ukraine.

Moscow has also repeatedly rejected all allegations in the West media and governments about alleged plans for invading Ukraine – the Russia authorities have strongly stated that the country poses no threat to anyone.

158,"Truss’ call to hide guilt on colonial past does not sound smart, but arrogant",Global Times,2021-12-06,"Elizabeth Truss, in a bizarre and twisted move to display a confident UK to the world, ""will urge UK to stop the guilt about colonial past,"" Daily Mail reported on Sunday.  The question is, has the UK ever been burdened by the sense of guilt for its colonial past, or has the UK been so busy apologizing to any of its former colonies?The report noted that in her major policy speech she is set to deliver to the Chatham House think tank this week, Elizabeth Truss will say the UK should not be racked with shame about its history and will stress that UK diplomats should be ""unleashed and empowered"" to promote ""the best of UK business, culture and values of freedom, democracy and human rights around the world."" Daily Mail did not name a specific source. Still, the article has been widely re-posted by media outlets and on social media the following day.Observers from China, a country which fought two Opium Wars against the UK aggressors, find Elizabeth Truss' wordings beyond comprehension, as she shows not even a bit of shame for her country's invasive and violent history on other people's lands, but, unbelievably, she shows confidence.The content left people an impression: Yes, the UK has a past with both glory and crimes, and we should simply leave the dark side of it behind. Maybe that's exactly what Elizabeth Truss wants, to trigger a controversy, to stir up a sensation, to catch more eyeballs, and to ""burnish her credentials as the 'new Margaret Thatcher',"" as Daily Mail put it. Elizabeth Truss seems to have tried hard to become a present-day Thatcher. During her trip in late November to Estonia where she visited UK troops, Elizabeth Truss rode in a tank and warned Russia against making a ""strategic mistake"" if the latter launches an invasion of Ukraine. Many UK media outlets said she has recreated one of Thatcher's most iconic photos, in which Thatcher appeared in a UK tank in Fallingbostel, West Germany, in 1986. The photo taken in Estonia fueled speculation about Elizabeth Truss' ""leadership ambitions,"" The Times reported on November 30. Elizabeth Truss may want to clear the doubts both at home and abroad toward the post-Brexit UK, and she chose to do so by being tough on foreign policy, Cui Hongjian, director of the Department of EU Studies at the China Institute of International Studies, told the Global Times. However, being tough needs to be backed by solid national strength.London is now confronting challenges from both Brexit and the fierce major power games worldwide. However, the UK is on a stable path of decline. Still, it announced a grand goal of ""Global UK,"" wishing to maintain its major power status and attempting to gain interests in this era of change. That being said, the UK needs to find an approach to unite its people at home and face the world with a new image, Cui noted. Elizabeth Truss tosses out her approach - making a revisionist suggestion on how UK people should view their colonial history. This does not sound smart, this sounds arrogant. Worse, she unveils the real mentality of not only herself, but many more white UK elites. ""Elizabeth Truss is a fanatic. She was only chosen for her job because of her market appeal to Prime Minister Boris Johnson's 'Brexit branding' which is very populist,"" Tom Fowdy, a UK political and international relations analyst, told the Global Times. He noted that the mantra of Brexit is anchored on pro-imperial nostalgia which creates the delusion of UK still being a globally dominant power. ""As a part of this mentality, there is a denial of the UK's current place in the world, as well as a lack of remorse for the atrocities of its past while actively crusading against other countries,"" Fowdy said. As a result, when Elizabeth Truss tries to shape her own image as a next Iron Lady, what she has really presented is the UK's predicament - the widening gap between the country's strength and its ambitions, which is exactly the same as Elizabeth Truss' own awkward situation. As Daily Mail said, ""Posing in one of our few tanks, Elizabeth Truss is not the same as being an Iron Lady.""",OPINION,OBSERVER,British Foreign Secretary Elizabeth Truss Photo: AFP,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'Elizabeth Truss': ('PER', 6), 'Margaret Thatcher': ('PER', 4), 'Elizabethruss': ('PER', 2), 'UK': ('LOC', 13), 'China': ('LOC', 2), 'Estonia': ('LOC', 2), 'Russia': ('LOC', 1), 'Ukraine': ('LOC', 1), 'West Germany': ('LOC', 1), 'Hongji': ('LOC', 1), 'Daily Mail': ('ORG', 3), 'Chatham House': ('ORG', 1), 'Times': ('ORG', 1), 'Bxi': ('ORG', 1), 'C': ('ORG', 1), 'Department': ('ORG', 1), 'EU': ('ORG', 1), 'Opium Wars': ('MISC', 1)}"

The US has left endless trails of bloodshed and turmoil around the world. While the US ""model of democracy"" loses its shine, the US still attempts to establish exclusive cliques through the so-called democracy summit. To expose the true nature of ""US democracy,"" the Global Times is publishing a series of articles to unmask the US' four democratic hegemonic sins. This is the third such piece.For decades, the US has never stopped its interference in other countries' internal affairs in the name of upholding religious freedom; it destabilized entire nations, and incited opposition and division. It also continues to support ""religious groups"" and their leaders in various countries, transforming them into US agents for the spreading of its hegemonic gospel. Today, its failure is obvious, as more and more countries have come to oppose such interventionism on their domestic affairs, and on the other hand, jihadist and extremist groups have been on the increase and continued to spread to wider reaches of the globe thanks to the US' support - explicitly and covertly - when it took them as tools to control other nations.Experts point out that as the US carries out an ideological expansion and tightens its hegemonic grip worldwide, religion has become one of the most important tools for its foreign intervention, and has also been used as a means to seek political power and economic control.Moreover, its annual report on religious freedom, ostensibly an assessment of so-called religious human rights, is only in line with US's geopolitical stance.

Photo: Agence France-Presse Messing up religionsIn the past decades, especially since the end of the Cold War, the revival of religions and subsequent religious conflicts have become important social phenomena in the international society. When analyzing these phenomena carefully, it is not that spiritual theism is at work, but that the social nature of religion is artificially elevated and strengthened. Religious theism is used by countries such as the US and certain interest groups as a means of seeking political power and economic benefits.In January 2019, the Ukraine Orthodox Church was declared independent, breaking off its centuries-old ties with the Russia Orthodox Church. But behind the split of the Russia Orthodox Church are political machinations.Russia Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov asserted in November that US has long attempted to press for a split in the Orthodox world, Tass reported.The head of the schismatic Orthodox Church of Ukraine, or Epiphanius as regarded in the public, is said to be creating an organization that would have been impossible to govern without direct support from the US, according to Lavrov.Observer said that the move, which could affect millions of followers, ""is a big blow for Russia"" and could lead to ""serious conflict,"" the BBC reported.The Orthodox split is one of many cases in which the US attempts to use religion as a tool to interfere in other countries' and regions' internal affairs in order to serve its international strategy.The US is also directly behind some of the cult activities. For instance, the infamous Falun Gong sect has been alleged to be under the direction of the National Endowment for Democracy (NED), and received large amounts in funding.  Falun Gong  has long been banned by the China government in accordance with the law. A large number of facts have proven that Falun Gong is an anti-government and anti-people cult organization. The series of illegal activities planned and orchestrated by the organization are open provocations against democracy and legal systems, and endanger national security and social stability. Moreover, the US, with its ""Tibet Bill,"" used human rights and religion as excuses to distort and smear the development of the Xizang Autonomous Region in Southwest China, discredit China's ethnic and religious policies, and interfere with the tradition and order of the reincarnation of Living Buddhas.""The fundamental purpose of the bill is to undermine the prosperity and stability of Xizang,"" Ji Rong, spokesperson at the China Embassy in India, said in December 2020.Inside the territory of the US, it is clear it has been using its own religion [Christian] to apply cultural protectionism and exclude foreign culture, immigrants, and different ethnicities, Zhuo Xinping, former director of Institute of World Religions of the China Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times on Sunday.The US also considers its mainstream culture or religion ""universal value,"" and has been exporting it around the world, which formed a cultural hegemony that they used to interfere in the internal affairs and cultural development of other countries, Zhuo noted.There is no such thing as so-called dominant, absolute ""universal value."" the exact same religion could be performed differently in different places, times, cultures, and by different ethnicities, Zhuo said, noting that the communication of religions should be based on sincerity, equality, and mutual respect, instead of aggressively indoctrinating others as a way of injecting their ""universal values"" to others, like what the West has long done.It only shows power politics and systems of a hegemony, Zhuo said.

Photo: AFPCultivating extremismThe US, directly and indirectly, supports extremist religious forces in Central Asia and other regions under the guise of protecting religious freedom.Absurdly, the US, the country that has killed the biggest number of Muslims across the world, has repeatedly said that they are attempting to protect the human rights of Muslims in China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region. It is well known that notorious organizations such as the East Turkistan Islamic Movement (ETIM), the World Uyghur Congress (WUC), and the East Turkistan Education and Solidarity Association (ETESA) have long engaged in anti-China separatist activities both inside and outside China. From 1990 to 2016, the ""three evil forces"" - terrorism, extremism, and separatism - supported or directly participated by the above organizations, carried out or plotted thousands of violent and terror attacks in Xinjiang and other places, and engaged in anti-China separatist activities under the guise of religion, critically endangering the lives of local Muslims and other residents.However, the US impugned the China government's crackdown on these three evil forces as ""oppression of Muslims.""As early as in 2002, ETIM was categorized as a terrorist organization and was added to the sanctions list under the UN Resolutions 1267 and 1390, however, former US president Donald Trump's administration removed it from the US' list of international terrorist organizations.It once again exposed the US' double standards on counter-terrorism and its repulsive practice of condoning terrorist groups as it sees fit, said experts.Another recent example is that Russia revealed, through evidence, the links between US officials and Islamic State militants, as data shows that the US cooperates with ISIS militants, such as in air strikes by the US Air Force targeting the positions of the Taliban troops that clashed with ISIS.Russia Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said on July 22 that Russia has many questions about unmarked helicopter flights, recorded since 2017, over the areas of activity of ISIS militants, especially in northern Afghanistan. ""According to Afghan sources, the helicopters were used to deliver reinforcements, weapons, and munitions, and to evacuate killed and wounded terrorists from battlefields… I should stress once again, this kind of activity was not possible without the knowledge of the US and NATO, who completely controlled the Afghan air space.""The Syrian War is another example as the CIA is reported to have played an important role behind the scenes since 2012, coordinating arms shipments to the rebels by US allies, of which most ended up in the possession of militant jihadist groups, BBC reported.Since 2014 when the US started to station troops in Syria, a large number of extremist religious forces appeared and committed atrocities in Syria's civil war. In order to overthrow Assad, the US has provided the weapons and equipment - through various channels to Syria's insurgency - many of which flew into the hands of extremist religious forces. The support has been consistent until now, sabotaging the peace process in the country.

Photo: Agence France-Presse Policing on othersIn addition, the US government keeps meddling in the international human rights arena through the annual release of the so-called International Religious Freedom Report. But experts pointed out that it is based on the interest of the US government and serves to reinforce hegemonic values. For example, in the 2002 International Religious Freedom Report, Myanmar, China, Iran, Iraq, North Korea, and Sudan were listed as ""countries of special concern,"" however, the 2004 report removed Iraq from the list despite that in US-occupied Iraq, the ""holy war"" continued to kill, and the safety of the people was difficult to guarantee. Could there possibly be greater freedom of religious belief in such chaos? At least 660,000 Iraqi civilians have been killed since the US' invasion of Iraq in 2003, which has been criticized internationally as one of the worst humanitarian crises of the 21st century.The China Foreign Ministry in May 2021 slammed the US State Department's 2020 International Religious Freedom Report and its unilateral sanctions against two China officials under the guise of so-called religious issues. ""The so-called report, full of ideological prejudice, ignores the facts, wantonly slanders China's religious policy, and seriously interferes in China's internal affairs,"" the Foreign Ministry spokesperson said.The annual report, which groundlessly lambasts the freedom of religious belief in China and viciously slandered China's religious policies, was met with general indignation among China religious circles and numerous religious believers, said a statement issued by the secretariat of the joint conference of China's national religious groups in May 2020.Spreading ""religious freedom"" around the world has become part of what US consider their mission and national interest, Cao Wei, an expert on security studies at Lanzhou University, told the Global Times. ""However, such religious belief has gone beyond US sovereignty and goes toward interventionism. It is strongly connected to its geopolitical interests, and the 'double standards' are also blatantly obvious.""

160,The State of Democracy in the United States,China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs,2021-12-05,"FM issued a report on US democracy, through listing facts, numbers and opinions of relevant organizations and experts, combing the disadvantages of the US' democratic system, analyzing US's chaos of democratic practices and the harm of exporting democracy.PreambleI. What is democracy?II. The alienation and three malaises of democracy in the US1.

It is a right for all nations, not a prerogative reserved to a few. Democracy takes different forms, and there is no one-size-fits-all model. It would be totally undemocratic to measure the diverse political systems in the world with a single yardstick or examine different political civilizations from a single perspective. The political system of a country should be independently decided by its own people.  The US' system of democracy is derived from its own practices. This system is unique, not universally applicable, and it is far from perfect. However, over the years, the US, despite the structural flaws and problematic practice of its democratic system, has claimed itself as the ""model of democracy"". It has incessantly interfered in other countries' internal affairs and waged wars under the guise of ""democracy"", creating regional turbulence and humanitarian disasters.  Based on facts and expert opinions, this report aims to expose the deficiencies and abuse of democracy in the US as well as the harm of its exporting such democracy. It is hoped that the US will improve its own system and practices of democracy and change its way of interacting with other countries. This is in the interest of not only the US people, but also the people of other countries. If no country seeks to dictate standards for democracy, impose its own political system on others or use democracy as a tool to suppress others, and when all countries can live and thrive in diversity, our world will be a better place.I. What is democracy?Democracy is a term that derives from the ancient Greek language. It means ""rule by the people"" or ""sovereignty of the people"". As a form of government, democracy has been practiced for over 2,500 years, though in different forms, such as direct democracy of the ancient Athenian citizens and representative government in modern times. Democracy is a manifestation of the political advancement of humanity.Democracy is not an adornment or publicity stunt; rather, it is meant to be used to solve problems faced by the people. To judge whether a country is democratic, it is important to see whether its people run their own country. In addition to voting rights, it is important to see whether people have the rights to extensive participation. It is important to see what promises are made in an election campaign and, more importantly, how many of those promises are honored afterwards. It is important to see what political procedures and rules are instituted by a country's systems and laws and, more importantly, whether these systems and laws are truly executed. It is important to see whether the rules and procedures governing the exercise of power are democratic and, more importantly, whether power is truly put under the oversight and checks of the people.A functional democracy must have a full set of institutional procedures; more importantly, it should have full participation of the people. It must ensure democracy in terms of both process and outcomes. It must encompass both procedural and substantive democracy, both direct and indirect democracy. It must ensure both people's democracy and the will of the State. If the people of a country are only called upon to vote and then are forgotten once they have cast their votes; if the people only hear high-sounding promises during an election campaign but have no say whatsoever afterwards; or if they are wooed when their votes are wanted but are ignored once the election is over, then such a democracy is not a true democracy.Whether a country is democratic should be judged and determined by its own people, not by a minority of self-righteous outsiders.There is no perfect system of democracy in the world, nor is there a political system that fits all countries. Democracy is established and developed based on a country's own history and adapted to its national context, and each country's democracy has its unique value. Members of the international community should engage in exchanges and dialogues on democracy on the basis of equality and mutual respect, and work together to contribute to the progress of humanity.II. The alienation and three malaises of democracy in the USFrom a historical perspective, the development of democracy in the US was a step forward. The political party system, the representative system, one person one vote, and the separation of powers negated and reformed the feudal autocracy in EU. The well-known France writer Alexis de Tocqueville recognized this in his book Democracy in US. The Declaration of Independence, the Bill of Rights, abolitionist movement, civil rights movement and affirmative action were highlights in the advancement of US democracy. The principle of ""government of the people, by the people and for the people"" articulated by Abraham Lincoln is recognized worldwide.However, over the years, democracy in the US has become alienated and degenerated, and it has increasingly deviated from the essence of democracy and its original design. Problems like money politics, identity politics, wrangling between political parties, political polarization, social division, racial tension and wealth gap have become more acute. All this has weakened the functioning of democracy in the US.The US has often used democracy as a pretext to meddle in other countries' internal affairs, causing political chaos and social unrest in these countries, and undermining world peace and stability and social tranquility in other countries. This makes many people in the US and other countries wonder if the US is still a democracy. The world needs to take a closer look at the current state of democracy in the US, and the US itself should also conduct some soul-searching.1. The system fraught with deep-seated problemsThe US calls itself ""city upon a hill"" and a ""beacon of democracy""; and it claims that its political system was designed to defend democracy and freedom at the time of its founding. Yet, the vision of democracy has lost its shine in the US today. The self-styled US democracy is now gravely ill with money politics, elite rule, political polarization and a dysfunctional system.(1) US-style democracy has become ""a game of money politics""The US-style democracy is a rich men's game based on capital, and is fundamentally different from democracy of the people.Over a hundred years ago, Republican Senator from Ohio Mark Hanna said of US politics: ""There are two things that are important in politics. The first is money, and I can't remember the second."" More than one hundred years have passed, and money has not only remained ""the currency"" in US politics, but also become even more indispensable. For example, the 2020 presidential election and Congressional elections cost some US$14 billion, two times that of 2016 and three times that of 2008; indeed, they are known as the most expensive elections in US history. The cost of the presidential election reached another record high of US$6.6 billion, and the Congressional elections cost over US$7 billion.The fact that the US people have to face is that money politics has penetrated the entire process of election, legislation and administration. People in fact only have a restricted right to political participation. The inequality in economic status has been turned into inequality in political status. Only people with enough capital can enjoy their democratic rights provided by the Constitution. Money politics have increasingly become an ""irremovable tumor"" in US society and a mockery of democracy in the US.A US Senator had a sharp observation, ""Congress does not regulate Wall Street. Wall Street regulates Congress."" According to statistics, winners of 91% of US Congressional elections are the candidates with greater financial support. Big companies, a small group of rich people, and interest groups are generous with their support and have become the main source of electoral funding. And those so-called representatives of the people, once elected, often serve the interests of their financial backers. They speak for vested interests rather than the ordinary people.  In March 2020, Robert Reich, Professor of Public Policy at University of California, Berkeley and former Secretary of Labor, published a book entitled The System, Who Rigged It, How We Fix It. According to him, the US political system has been hijacked by a tiny minority over the past four decades. Political donations are almost seen as ""legitimate bribery"". They enable the rich to have more political clout. During the 2018 midterm elections, the huge political donations, mostly coming from the top 0.01% ultra-rich of the US population, accounted for over 40% of campaign finance. Money politics and lobby groups are restricting channels for ordinary US to speak out, whose voices expressing genuine concerns are overshadowed by a handful of interest groups. The oligarchs would enrich themselves with the power they have got while totally ignoring the interests of ordinary US.On 23 September 2020, in an interview with Harvard Law Today, Harvard Law School Professor Matthew Stephenson said that the US is by no means the world leader in clean government, and certain practices related to lobbying and campaign finance that other countries would consider corrupt are not only permitted but constitutionally protected in the US.(2)  ""One person one vote"" in name, ""rule of the minority elite"" in realityThe US is a typical country dominated by an elite class. Political pluralism is only a facade. A small number of elites dominate the political, economic and military affairs. They control the state apparatus and policy-making process, manipulate public opinion, dominate the business community and enjoy all kinds of privileges. Since the 1960s in particular, the Democrats and Republicans have taken turns to exercise power, making the ""multiparty system"" dead in all but name. For ordinary voters, casting their votes to a third party or an independent candidate is nothing more than wasting the ballot. In effect, they can only choose either the Democratic candidate or the Republican one.In the context of Democratic-Republican rivalry, the general public's participation in politics is restricted to a very narrow scope. For ordinary voters, they are only called upon to vote and are forgotten once they have cast their ballots. Most people are just ""walk-ons"" in the theater of election. This makes ""government by the people"" hardly possible in US political practice.Noam Chomsky, a political commentator and social activist from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, points out that the US is a ""really existing capitalist democracy"", where there is a positive correlation between people's wealth and their influence on policy-making. For the lower 70% on the wealth/income scale, they have no influence on policy whatsoever. They are effectively disenfranchised.Ray La Raja, Professor at the University of Massachusetts, notes in an article for The Atlantic that US's current system is democratic only in form, not in substance. The nominating process is vulnerable to manipulation by plutocrats, celebrities, media figures and activists. Many presidential primary voters mistakenly back candidates who do not reflect their views.(3) The checks and balances have resulted in a ""vetocracy""US political scientist Francis Fukuyama points out in his book Political Order and Political Decay that there is an entrenched political paralysis in the US. The US political system has far too many checks and balances, raising the cost of collective action and in some cases making it impossible altogether. Fukuyama calls the system a ""vetocracy"". Since the 1980s, the ""vetocracy"" of the US has become a formula for gridlock.The US democratic process is fragmented and lengthy, with a lot of veto points where individual veto players can block action by the whole body. The function of ""checks and balances"", which was purportedly designed to prevent abuse of power, has been distorted in US political practice. Political polarization continues to grow as the two parties drift further apart in political agenda and their areas of consensus have reduced significantly. An extreme case is the fact that ""the most liberal Republican now remains significantly to the right of the most conservative Democrat"". Antagonism and mutual inhibition have become commonplace, ""vetocracy"" has defined US political culture, and a vindictive ""if I can't, you can't either"" mentality has grown prevalent.Politicians in US, D.C. are preoccupied with securing their own partisan interests and don't care at all about national development. Vetoing makes one identify more strongly with their peers in the same camp, who may in turn give them greater and quicker support. Consequently the two parties are caught in a vicious circle, addicted to vetoing. Worse still, the government efficacy is inevitably weakened, law and justice trampled upon, development and progress stalled, and social division widened. In the US today, people are increasingly identifying themselves as a Republican or a Democrat instead of as an US. The negative impacts of identity politics and tribal politics have also spilled over into other sectors of US society, further exacerbating ""vetocracy"".According to a Pew Research Center report in October 2021 based on a survey of 17 advanced economies (including the US, Germany and the Republic of Korea), the US is more politically divided than the other economies surveyed. Nine in ten US respondents believe there are conflicts between people who support different political parties, and nearly 60% of US surveyed think their fellow citizens no longer disagree simply over policies, but also over basic facts.  Jungkun Seo, Professor of Political Science at Kyung Hee University, observes that as political polarization intensifies in the US, the self-cleaning process of US democracy, which aims to drive reform through elections, will no longer be able to function properly. With the Senate trapped in a filibuster, the US Congress no longer serves as a representative body for addressing changes in US society through legislation.(4) The flawed electoral rules impair fairness and justiceThe US presidential election follows the time-honored Electoral College system, where the president and vice president are not elected directly by popular vote, but by the Electoral College consisting of 538 electors. The candidate who achieves a majority of 270 or more electoral votes wins the election.The flaws of such an electoral system are self-evident. First, as the president-elect may not be the winner of the national popular vote, there is a lack of broader representation. Second, as each state gets to decide its own electoral rules, this may create confusion and disorder. Third, the winner-takes-all system exacerbates inequality among states and between political parties. It leads to a huge waste of votes and discourages voter turnout. Voters in ""deep blue"" and ""deep red"" states are often neglected, while swing states become disproportionately more important where both parties seek to woo more supporters.There have been five presidential elections in US history in which the winners of nationwide popular vote were not elected the president. The most recent case was the 2016 presidential election in which Republican candidate Donald Trump won 62.98 million popular votes or 45.9% of the total, while Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton won 65.85 million or 48% of popular votes. Although Donald Trump lost the popular vote, he won 304 electoral votes while Clinton secured only 227, which gave Donald Trump his presidency.Another flaw of the electoral system widely acknowledged by the US public is gerrymandering. In 1812, Governor of Massachusetts Elbridge Gerry signed a bill in the interest of his own party, creating in his state an odd-shaped electoral district that was compared to a salamander. Such practice was later called gerrymandering, which refers to an unfair division of electoral districts in favor of a particular party to win as many seats as possible and cement its advantage.The US conducts a census every ten years. Following the completion of the census, redistricting or the redrawing of electoral district boundaries will take place under the principle of maintaining roughly equal population in every voting district while considering demographic shifts. Under the US Constitution, each state legislature has the power to redistrict. This leaves room for the majority party in state legislatures to manipulate the redrawing of electoral districts. Two principal tactics are often used in gerrymandering. One is ""packing"", i.e. concentrating the opposition party's voters in a few districts, thus giving up these districts to secure the others. The other is ""cracking"", i.e. splitting up areas where the opposition party's supporters are concentrated and incorporating them into neighboring districts, thus diluting votes for the opposition party.On 27 September 2021, the Democratic-governed state of Oregon became the first in the country to complete redistricting. Electoral districts firmly in the hands of the Democratic Party have increased from two to four, and swing districts reduced from two to one. This means that the Democratic Party can control 83% of the state's congressional districts with 57% of voters. On the contrary, the Republican-controlled state of Texas, with new electoral district boundaries determined on 25 October 2021, has seen districts held by Republicans grow from 22 to 24 and swing districts shrink from six to one. The Republican Party now occupies 65% of state House seats with just 52.1% of voters.According to a YouGov poll in August 2021, just 16% of US adult citizens say they think their states' congressional maps would be drawn fairly, while 44% say they think the maps would be drawn unfairly and another 40% of adults say they are unsure if the maps will be fair. As US politics grows more polarized, both the Republican and Democratic parties are seeking to maximize their own interests, and gerrymandering becomes the best approach.The superdelegate system of the Democratic Party is also an impediment to fair election. The superdelegates include major Democratic leaders, members of the Democratic National Committee, Democratic members of Congress, and incumbent Democratic governors, and are seated automatically. The superdelegates may support any candidate they choose or follow the will of the Party leadership without giving any consideration to the wishes of the general public.The late political analyst Mark Plotkin wrote on The Hill that the ""Democrats' superdelegate system is unfair and undemocratic"", and ""the process of eliminating this elitist exercise should immediately begin"".(5) Dysfunctional democracy triggers trust crisisThe US-style democracy is more like a meticulously set up scene in Hollywood movies where a bunch of well-heeled characters publicly pledge commitment to the people, but actually busy themselves with behind-the-scene deals. Political infighting, money politics, and vetocracy make it virtually impossible for quality governance to be delivered as desired by the general public. US are increasingly disillusioned with US politics and pessimistic about the US-style democracy.A Gallup survey in October 2020 shows that only COVID-19% of the US surveyed are ""very confident"" about the presidential election, a record low since the survey was first conducted in 2004.In November 2020, an online Wall Street Journal report argues that the 2020 general election can be seen as the culmination of a two-decade decline in faith in democracy in the US.According to a poll by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research, only 16% of US say democracy is working well or extremely well; 45% think democracy isn't functioning properly, while another 38% say it's working only somewhat well. A Pew Research Center survey finds that just 20% of US say they trust the federal government just about always or most of the time.A Brookings online article in May 2021 indicates that the certification of the 2020 election results by all 50 states still leaves 77% of Republican voters questioning the legitimacy of President Joe Biden's election victory due to allegations of voter fraud. This is the first time such things happen since the 1930s.A CNN poll in September reveals that 56% of US think democracy in the US is under attack; 52% reply they are just a little or not at all confident that elections reflect the will of the people; 51% say it's likely that elected officials in the next few years will overturn the results of an election their party did not win.A 2021 Pew survey conducted among 16,000 adults in 16 advanced economies and 2,500 adults in the US shows that 57% of international respondents and 72% of US believe that democracy in the US has not been a good example for others to follow in recent years.2.Messy and chaotic practices of democracyThat democracy in the US has gone wrong is reflected not only in its system design and general structure, but also in the way it is put into practice. The US is not a straight A student when it comes to democracy, still less a role model for democracy. The gunshots and farce on Capitol Hill have completely revealed what is underneath the gorgeous appearance of the US-style democracy. The death of Black US George Floyd has laid bare the systemic racism that exists in US society for too long, and spurred a deluge of protests rippling throughout the country and even the whole world.While COVID-19 pandemic remains out of control in the US, the issue of mask-wearing and vaccination has triggered further social division and confrontation. Dividends of economic growth are distributed unfairly, and income growth has stalled for most ordinary people for a long period of time. The US-style democracy can hardly uphold public order and ethics, nor advance public well-being to the fullest.(1) The Capitol riot that shocks the worldOn the afternoon of 6 January 2021, thousands of US gathered on Capitol Hill, US, D.C. and stormed the Capitol building in a bid to stop the joint session of the Congress from certifying the newly-elected president. The incident interrupted the transfer of US presidential power, leaving five dead and over 140 injured. It is the worst act of violence in US, D.C. since 1814 when the UK troops set fire to the White House, and it is the first time in more than 200 years that the Capitol was invaded. Senate Republican leader described it as a ""failed insurrection"". A scholar from the US Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) exclaims that the US is not nearly as unique as many US believe, and that the Capitol riot should put an end to the notion of US exceptionalism, of an eternal shining city on a hill.The assault on the Capitol has undermined the three major bedrocks of the US-style democracy.First, ""democracy"" in the US is not democratic as it claims. The refusal of some US politicians to recognize the election results and their supporters' subsequent violent storming of the Capitol building have severely undercut the credibility of democracy in the US.Second, ""freedom"" in the US is not free as it claims. Twitter, Facebook and other social media platforms suspended the personal accounts of some US politicians, a de facto announcement of their ""death on social media"". This has bust the myths of ""freedom of speech"" in the US.Third, the ""rule of law"" in the US is not bound by the law as it claims. The totally different attitudes taken by US law enforcement agencies toward the ""Black Lives Matter"" (BLM) protests and the Capitol riot are yet another reminder of the double standards in the US ""rule of law"".The assault on the Capitol sent shock waves throughout the international community. While deploring the violence, many people also expressed disappointment at the US.UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson tweeted that what happened in the US Capitol were ""disgraceful scenes"". France President Emmanuel Macron said that ""in one of the world's oldest democracies ... a universal idea — that of 'one person, one vote' — is undermined."" South Africa President Cyril Ramaphosa commented that it ""shook the foundations"" of democracy in the US.Former Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono tweeted that the political farce in the US offers much food for thought, and that there is no perfect democracy, especially when it comes to its practices.  (2) Entrenched racismRacism is an indelible blot on democracy in the US. While advocating ""all men are created equal"", the founding fathers of the US left the institution of slavery untouched in the Constitution of 1789. Today, although racial segregation has been ostensibly abolished in the US, white supremacy is still rife and rampant across the country. Discrimination against Black US and other racial minorities remains a systemic phenomenon.US society has experienced relapses of its malaise of racial discrimination from time to time. On 25 May 2020, George Floyd, a Black US, lost his life in Minnesota because of law enforcement violence by the police. ""I can't breathe"" — Floyd's desperate plea for life before his death — sparked public outrage. Afterwards, protests and demonstrations erupted in about 100 cities across the 50 states of US, demanding justice for Floyd and protesting against racial discrimination. The demonstrations continued more than 100 days after the incident.What happened to George Floyd is merely an epitome of the tragic plight of Black US over the past centuries. Sandra Shullman, Past President of the US Psychological Association, says that US is in ""a racism pandemic"". The dream of civil rights leader Martin Luther King, Jr. remains unrealized. According to an editorial of The India Express, a mainstream newspaper of India, US racism has endured, subverting the country's deepest democratic institutions in the process.In February 2021, Stanford News, a website of Stanford University, carried an article examining systemic racism in the US. The article suggests that in education, youth of color are more likely to be closely watched; in the criminal justice system, people of color, particularly Black men, are disproportionately targeted; and in the economy and employment, from who moves forward in the hiring process to who receives funding from venture capitalists, Black US and other minority groups are discriminated against in the workplace and economy-at-large. A study by the University of US finds that around 30,800 people died from police violence between 1980 and 2018 in the US, which is about 17,100 higher than the official figure. It also indicates that Africa US are 3.5 times more likely to be killed by police violence than white US.The anger erupting across US is not just Black anger, but across racial lines. An article published on the website of The Jerusalem Post of Israel notes that US Jews are concerned about right-wing antisemitism and violence driven by white supremacist groups. According to annual surveys conducted by the US Jewish Committee, in 2020, 43% US Jews feel less secure than a year ago, and in 2017, 41% say antisemitism is a serious problem in the US, up from 21% in 2016, 21% in 2015, and 14% in 2013.The bullying of US of Asia descent is increasing in the US. Since the outbreak of COVID-19, there have been growing cases of Asia US humiliated or attacked in public places. Statistics from the US Federal Bureau of Investigation indicate that hate crimes against people of Asia descent rose by 76% in the US in 2020. From March 2020 to June 2021, the organization Stop Asia US and Pacific Islanders Hate received over 9,000 incident reports. A survey of young Asia US on the National Broadcasting Company (NBC) website shows that in the past year, a quarter of young Asia US became targets of racial bullying, nearly half of the respondents expressed pessimism about their situation, and a quarter of the respondents expressed fear about the situation of themselves and their families.(3) Tragic mishandling of COVID-19 pandemicWith the best health and medical resources in the world as it claims, the US has been a total mess when it comes to COVID-19 response. It has the world's highest numbers of infections and deaths.According to figures released by Johns Hopkins University, as of the end of November 2021, confirmed COVID-19 cases in the US had exceeded 48 million, and the number of deaths had surpassed 770,000, both the highest in the world.On 8 January this year, 300,777 new confirmed cases were reported, a record single-day increase since the COVID-19 outbreak in the US. On 13 January alone, 4,170 US died of COVID-19, far exceeding the death toll of the 9/11 terrorist attacks.At the end of November, the average daily increase of confirmed cases in the US had climbed to over 70,000, and daily death toll to over 700.One in every 500 US have died of COVID-19. Up to now, COVID-19 deaths in the US have surpassed its total death toll from the 1919 Influenza Pandemic, and its combined deaths in World War I, World War II, the Korean War, the Vietnam War, the Iraq War and the war in Afghanistan.If the US had taken a science-based response, a lot more lives could have been saved. The pandemic, as epidemiologist and former head of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention William Foege put it, is a ""slaughter"".The pandemic has taken a heavy toll on the US economy. The rate and scale of business shutdown and unemployment in the country are beyond imagination, leaving a large number of US jobless. People's anxiety and sense of powerlessness has been exacerbated by growing factors of social instability.The COVID-19 Hardship Watch released by the US Center on Budget and Policy Priorities on 29 July 2021 suggests that while there have been improvements over the situation in December 2020, hardship is widespread for US in the first half of 2021. Some 20 million adults live in households that have not got enough to eat, 11.40 million adult renters are behind on rent, facing the risk of being evicted.As indicated in the statistics released by the US Census Bureau, by 5 July 2021, at least one member in 22% of all households with underage dependents had lost their source of income.US consumer confidence has dropped substantially, and progress in job market recovery has stalled. Institutions such as Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and Oxford Economics have significantly revised down growth forecasts for the US economy. At the same time, the pandemic, coupled with three rounds of massive economic stimulus plans, among other factors, has caused port congestion and supply shortages, pushing inflation higher. In October of this year, US CPI surged by 6.2% from a year earlier, marking a year-on-year rise of no less than 5% for six consecutive months, and a record high since 2008.The root cause of the continued spread of the coronavirus in the US is not a dearth of science, but the refusal to trust and rely on science. For the sake of elections, some politicians have prioritized partisan interests over national interests, politicized pandemic response, and focused on shifting blames on others. The federal and state governments have failed to galvanize a concerted response to the pandemic, and are mired in infighting instead. As a result, pandemic response measures have been severely politicized. The choices with regard to vaccination and mask-wearing have become a bone of contention between the parties and among the people. There appears a growing trend of anti-intellectualism.A report by the France newspaper Le Monde observes that COVID-19 crisis has highlighted the fragility of democracy in the US. The extremely expensive health system, reserved for the rich and leaving the poorest without social security, has made this country, yet one of the most developed in the world, fall behind due to social injustice. This is a typical case of a democratic drift that makes it impossible to effectively manage a crisis.Stanford News notes that, in the area of public health, COVID-19 pandemic has disproportionately impacted communities of color and has highlighted the health disparities between Black US, whites and other demographic groups.(4) Widening wealth gapThe US is more polarized than any other West country in terms of wealth distribution. Its Gini coefficient has increased to 0.48 in 2021, almost the highest in 50 years. As revealed by reports of the Institute for Policy Studies, a US think tank, the combined wealth of US billionaires soared COVID-19-fold between 1990 and 2021, while over this same period, US median wealth only increased 5.37%. The harsh reality in the US is the rich is becoming richer, and the poor poorer.  According to Fed's October 2021 statistics, the middle 60% of US households by income, defined as the ""middle class"", saw their combined assets drop to 26.6% of national wealth as of June this year, the lowest in three decades, while the first 1% had a 27% share, surpassing the ""middle class"".A report by UC Berkeley economist Emmanuel Saez shows that in terms of average annual income, US's top 10% rich earn over nine times as much as the bottom 90%; the wealthiest 1% are about 40 times more than the bottom 90%; and the ultra-wealthy top 0.1% are 196 times of the bottom 90%.The stimulus policy that the US has introduced in response to COVID-19 has, while pushing up stock markets, further widened the gap between the rich and the poor. The wealth of US billionaires has grown US$1.763 trillion, or 59.8%, over the 16 months since the COVID-19 outbreak in the US. The wealthiest 10% now own 89% of all US stocks, registering a new historic high.The wealth polarization in the US is inherent to its own political system and the interests of the capital that its government represents. From the ""Occupy Wall Street"" movement, to the recent ""Harambe stares down Wall Street's Charging Bull"", the US people have never stopped condemning the widening wealth gap. Yet, nothing has changed. Those governing the US choose to do nothing about the growing wealth inequality. And the pandemic has further exposed a rule in US society — capital first and the rich first.(5) ""Freedom of speech"" in name onlyIn the US, the media is juxtaposed with the executive, the legislative and the judiciary as the ""fourth branch of government"" and journalists are considered ""uncrowned kings"". Though US media organizations claim to be independent from politics and serve freedom and truth, they are actually serving financial interests and party politics.A few media conglomerates maintain control of the US news media and have morphed into a political force with outsize influence.Under the Telecommunications Act of 1996, the federal government is required to relax regulation over the ownership of media outlets. This has led to an unprecedented wave of mergers and a crippling erosion of the diversity and independence of the US media. The drastic reduction in the number of media outlets has enabled a few companies to expand into monopolies.In the US, a few media conglomerates are now in control of over 90% of media outlets, netting them an annual profit even higher than the gross domestic product (GDP) of some developing countries.These media behemoths, while eager to make more business footprints, have extended their reach into US politics, attempting to sway political processes through lobbying, public relations campaign or political donations.  The US media monopolies have become ""invisible killers"" of civil and political rights.Robert McChesney, a leading US scholar in the studies of political economy of communications and professor at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, notes in his book Rich Media, Poor Democracy that media companies, profit-driven by nature, confine people to the world of entertainment programs, depriving their access to diversified information, distracting their interest in public affairs, diminishing their ability to distinguish between right and wrong, and muting their voice in the decision-making of social policies. In an US society dominated by media narratives, traditional notions of civic and political involvement have shriveled. Depoliticization has turned democracy into a political game without citizens.A report in Miami's New Herald argues that as the media is controlled by the elite and conglomerates, people are not able to distinguish between facts and political propaganda.    The US media is no longer a ""gatekeeper"" of democracy. The political wrangling between the Left and Right in the US media has further entrenched the estrangement and division between the two parties and between the elite and the mass public. It has aggravated political polarization in the US, pushing the political Left further left and the Right further right. And it has fueled the spread of extremist ideologies and populism in the US.According to a study by Sejong Institute, a think tank in the Republic of Korea, over 80% of conservative voters in the US see news reports by mainstream media outlets, such as New York Times, as false information and have a biased trust in media. Voters believe in only a few media outlets and would ignore communications at the national level. Levelheaded discussions and consensus-building have been replaced by megaphone politics and negative partisan strife.The Digital News Report 2021 issued by the University of Oxford and Reuters Institute indicates that among 92,000 online news consumers surveyed in 46 markets, those in the US have the lowest level of trust in news, a mere 29%.  In the information age when traditional media is on the decline, social media has become a new favorite for the general public. Yet, like traditional media, social media is also under the control of big capital and interest groups. To increase their website traffic, social media sites use algorithms to create ""information cocoons"", leaving extreme content unchecked and uncontrolled. This drives users toward self-reinforcing their existing views, exacerbates identity politics, and further divides public opinion.In October 2021, former Facebook employee Frances Haugen leaked tens of thousands of pages of explosive internal documents of Facebook. She disclosed to Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS) that Facebook would not hesitate to sacrifice public interests to keep users on its platform and make profits. Facebook has become a main platform for social extremists and is fraught with hate speech, disinformation and misinformation. Action is only taken on 3-5% of hate and about 0.6% of violence and incitement on the platform.3. Disastrous consequences of US export of its brand of democracyWithout regard to huge differences in the level of economic development and in the historical and cultural backgrounds of countries around the world, the US seeks to impose its own political system and values on other nations. It pushes for what it calls ""democratic transition"", and instigates ""color revolution"".It wantonly interferes in other countries' internal affairs and even subverts their governments, bringing about disastrous consequences for those countries. In other words, the US has attempted to model other countries after its own image and export its brand of democracy. Such attempts are entirely undemocratic and at odds with the core values and tenets of democracy. Without producing the expected chemistry, the US-style democracy has turned out to be a ""failed transplant"" that plunges many regions and countries into turmoil, conflicts and wars.(1) The ""color revolutions"" undermine regional and national stability The US has a habit of interfering in other countries' internal affairs in the name of ""democracy"" and seeking regime change to install pro-US governments.A former senior CIA official once talked about making people ""what we want them to be"" and ""follow our directions"", and the possibility of confusing people's minds, changing their values, and making them believe in the new values before they know it.Former Secretary of State Michael Pompeo openly admitted ""I was the CIA director. We lied, we cheated, we stole. We had entire training courses. It reminds you of the glory of the US experiment.""The US has developed a system of strategies and tactics for ""peaceful evolution"". It would start with ""cultural exchanges"", economic assistance, and then public opinion shaping to foster an atmosphere for ""color revolution"". It would exaggerate the mistakes and flaws of incumbent governments to foment public grievances and anti-government sentiments.In the meantime, it would brainwash local people with US values and make them identify with US's economic model and political system. It would also cultivate pro-US NGOs and provide all-round training to opposition leaders. It would seize the opportunity of major elections or emergencies to overthrow targeted governments through instigating street political activities.In recent history, the US has pushed for the neo-Monroe Doctrine in Latin US under the pretext of ""promoting democracy"", incited ""color revolution"" in Eurasia, and remotely controlled the ""Arab Spring"" in West Asia and North Africa. These moves have brought chaos and disasters to many countries, gravely undermining world peace, stability and development.In Latin US and the Caribbean, people have long been under no illusion about ""the US-style democracy"". Any attempt of the US to promote its self-styled ""model of democracy"" would be only self-defeating and self-humiliating.In 1823, the US issued the Monroe Doctrine, declaring ""US for the US"" and advocating ""Pan-Americanism"".In the following decades, the US, under the excuse of ""spreading democracy"", repeatedly carried out political interference, military intervention, and government subversion in Latin US and the Caribbean.The US pursued a policy of hostility toward socialist Cuba and imposed blockade against the country for nearly 60 years, and subverted the government of Chile under Salvador Allende. These were blatant acts of hegemonism. ""My way or no way."" That's the US logic. Since 2003, EU and Central Asia have seen the ""Rose Revolution"" in Georgia, the ""Orange Revolution"" in Ukraine, and the ""Tulip Revolution"" in Kyrgyzstan. The US State Department openly admitted playing a ""central role"" in these ""regime changes"".In October 2020, the Russia Foreign Intelligence Service revealed that the US planned to instigate ""color revolution"" in Moldova.The ""Arab Spring"" that started in 2010 was an earthquake that shook the entire Middle East. The US orchestrated the show behind the scene, and played a key role. The New York Times revealed in 2011 that a small core of US government-financed organizations were promoting democracy in ""authoritarian"" Arab states. A number of the groups and individuals directly involved in the ""Arab Spring"" revolts received training and financing from US organizations like the International Republican Institute, the National Democratic Institute and Freedom House.Mustafa Ahmady, an Africa and international affairs specialist in Ethiopia, contributed an article to Ahram Online entitled ""Promised Lands"", explaining that it was largely due to Obama's famous statement ""Now means now"" that furious Egypt protesters overthrew Mubarak, and that they paid a heavy price as a result of the political change.Seeing what the US had done, the Arab people have come to realize that the US wants to force a stereotyped model of democracy on them regardless of their own will.In countries forced to copy and paste US values, there is no sign of true democracy, true freedom, or true human rights. What have been left in these countries are prevailing scenes of persisting chaos, stagnation and humanitarian disasters.The US export of its values has disrupted the normal development process in the recipient countries, hindered their search for a development path and model befitting their national conditions, brought political, economic and social turmoils, and destroyed, one after another, what used to be other peoples' beautiful homelands. The turmoils, in turn, have given rise to terrorism and other long-term challenges that threaten and jeopardize regional and even global security.As suggested by the France website Le Grand Soir, democracy has long become a weapon of massive destruction for the US to attack countries with different views.The US applies different standards in assessing democracy of its own and other countries. It praises or belittles others entirely according to its own likes or dislikes. Following the Capitol attack on 6 January 2021, an US politician compared the incident of violence to the 9/11 terror attack, calling it a ""shameful assault"" on the US Congress, constitution and democracy. It is ironic that in June 2019 the same politician called the violent demonstrations at the Hong Kong Legislative Council building as a ""beautiful sight to behold"" and commended the rioters for their ""courage"". What a blatant double standard.(2) The US imposition of its brand of democracy causes humanitarian tragedies The US export of its brand of democracy by force has led to humanitarian disasters in many countries. The 20-year US war in Afghanistan has left the country devastated and impoverished. A total of 47,245 Afghan civilians and 66,000 to 69,000 Afghan soldiers and police who had nothing to do with 9/11 attacks were killed in US military operations, and more than 10 million people were displaced. The war destroyed the foundation for Afghanistan's economic development and reduced Afghans to destitution.In 2003, the US launched military strikes against Iraq for its alleged possession of weapons of mass destruction. The civilian death toll of the Iraq war is between 200,000 and 250,000, including over 16,000 directly killed by the US military. More than a million people lost their homes. Moreover, the US troops seriously violated international humanitarian principles, as evidenced by the frequent incidence of prisoner abuse. Until now the US has not been able to produce any credible proof of Iraq's possession of weapons of mass destruction.According to records available, 33,584 civilians were killed in war and conflict in Syria between 2016 and 2019. Among the victims, 3,833 were directly killed in bombings by the US-led coalition and half of them were women and children. The Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) reported on 9 November 2018 that the ""most accurate air strike in history"" launched by US forces on Raqqa alone killed 1,600 Syrian civilians.In 2018, the US launched airstrikes on Syria again for the purpose of, what they called, preventing the use of chemical weapons by the Syrian government. But the ""evidence"" of the alleged use of chemical weapons by the Syrian government turned out to be a fake video footage directed and produced by the White Helmets, an organization funded by intelligence agencies of the US and other countries.(3) The abuse of sanctions breaches international rulesUnilateral sanction is a ""big stick"" the US wields in dealing with other countries. Over many years, the US has exercised its financial hegemony and abused its technological clout to carry out frequent, unilateral bullying against other countries.The US has enacted some draconian laws, such as the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act, and the Countering US's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act, and issued a series of executive orders to target and sanction specific countries, entities or individuals.The ambiguous rules contained in these acts and executive orders, such as the ""minimum contacts principle"" and ""doctrine of effects"", are in fact a willful expansion of the jurisdiction of US domestic laws.These acts and executive orders make it possible for the US to abuse its domestic channels for prosecution and exercise ""long-arm jurisdiction"" over entities and individuals in other countries. The two most prominent examples are the case of France company Alstom and that of Huawei CFO Meng Wanzhou.Statistics show that the Donald Trump administration had imposed over 3,900 sanction measures, which means the US wielded its ""big stick"" three times a day on average. As of fiscal year 2021, the entities and individuals on US sanction lists topped 9,421, 933% higher compared to the previous fiscal year.The US unwarranted unilateral sanctions and ""long-arm jurisdiction"" have gravely undermined the sovereignty and security of other countries, severely impacting their economic development and people's wellbeing. The sanctions and ""long-arm jurisdiction"" constitute a gross violation of international law and basic norms of international relations.The US sanctions against other countries have continued unabated into 2021.The US administration, in collaboration with its EU allies, have ramped up containment and suppression against Russia, imposed blanket sanctions allegedly in response to the Navalny incident and alleged Russia cyber attacks and interference in US elections, among others, and launched a diplomatic war by the expulsion of Russia diplomats.With regard to issues such as the Nord Stream 2 natural gas pipeline project and the digital service tax, the US has not hesitated to sanction even its EU allies.Following the entry into force of the China-US phase one trade agreement, the US has taken further measures to suppress and contain China. It has placed over 940 China entities and individuals on its restricted lists. According to statistics from the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) of the US Department of the Treasury, as of COVID-19 October 2021, a total of 391 entities and individuals from China (including Hong Kong and Macao) have been sanctioned by the US.In an article published in the September/October 2021 issue of Foreign Affairs, Daniel Drezner, Professor at Tufts University and Senior Fellow at the Brookings Institution, criticizes successive US administrations for using ""sanctions as the go-to solution for nearly every foreign policy problem."" He notes that sanctions not only are ineffective, but also ""exert a humanitarian toll"", and that the US of US has become the ""US of Sanctions"".US unilateral sanctions are a continuous, grave violation of human rights of US and other peoples. The worst example is the protracted US blockade against Cuba.For more than 60 years, in total disregard of the many resolutions of the UN, the US has continued its comprehensive blockade against Cuba based on its embargo policies and domestic laws such as the Torricelli Act and the Helms-Burton Act.The Cuba blockade is the longest and cruelest systemic trade embargo, economic blockade and financial sanctions in modern history. The blockade has been gravely detrimental to Cuba's economic and social development, causing US$100 billion direct losses to Cuba's economy.US blockade and sanctions against Iran began in late 1970s. Over the past 40-plus years, US unilateral sanctions have increased in both intensity and frequency. They have gradually evolved into a rigorous sanction regime that covers finance, trade and energy, and are targeted at both entities and individuals. The purpose is to intensify pressure on Iran from all dimensions.In May 2018, the US government announced its unilateral withdrawal from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), and soon after resumed and expanded sanctions against Iran. Many countries and relevant entities have been forced to give up their cooperation with Iran. A large number of foreign oil enterprises left the country. Iran's manufacturing industry has been unable to keep up normal operations. The country has suffered economic slowdown, coupled with heightened inflation and massive currency depreciation.The US has imposed sanctions on Belarus, Syria and Zimbabwe, among others, over the years, and ratcheted up ""maximum pressure"" against the DPRK, Venezuela, etc.(4) The ""beacon of democracy"" draws global criticismThe people of the world have a discerning eye. They see very well the flaws and deficiencies of democracy in the US, hypocrisy in exporting US ""democratic values"", and US acts of bullying and hegemony around the world in the name of democracy.A Russia Foreign Ministry spokesperson once noted that the US is accustomed to posing as the ""global beacon of democracy"" and urging everyone else to take a humane approach to what they call ""peaceful protests"", but adopting completely opposite measures at home. She further noted that the US is ""not a beacon of democracy"", and that the US administration ""would do well to, first of all, listen to its own citizens and try to hear them, instead of engaging in witch-hunts in their own country and afterwards talking hypocritically about human rights in other countries"". The US is in no position to lecture other countries on human rights and civil liberties, she noted.In May 2021, Latana, a Germany polling agency, and the Alliance of Democracies founded by former NATO Secretary General and former Danish Prime Minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen, released a Democracy Perception Index which is based on a survey of over 50,000 people in 53 countries. The findings reveal that 44% of respondents are concerned that the US may pose a threat to democracy in their country, 50% of US surveyed are concerned that the US is an undemocratic country, and 59% of US respondents think that their government acts in the interest of a small group of people.In June 2021, Brian Klaas, Associate Professor of Politics at University College London, contributed an article to The US Post entitled ""The world is horrified by the dysfunction of US democracy"". The article quotes data from Pew Research Center, which suggest that ""US is no longer a 'shining city upon a hill'"" and that most US allies see democracy in the US as ""a shattered, washed-up has-been"", and that 69% of respondents in New Zealand, 65% in Australia, 60% in Canada, 59% in Sweden, 56% in the Netherlands and 53% in the United Kingdom do not think that the US political system works well. More than a quarter of people surveyed in France, Germany, New Zealand, Greece, Belgium and Sweden believe that US democracy has never been a good example to follow.A report by the polling agency Eupinions indicates that the EU's confidence in the US system has declined, with 52% of respondents believing the US democratic system does not work; 65% and 61% of respondents in France and Germany hold the same view.In September 2021, Martin Wolf, a renowned UK scholar, pointed out in his article ""The strange death of US democracy"" contributed to The Financial Times that the US political environment has reached an ""irreversible"" point, and ""the transformation of the democratic republic into an autocracy has advanced"".In November 2021, the International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance, a Sweden-based think tank, released The Global State of Democracy listing the US as a ""backsliding democracy"" for the first time. The Secretary General of the institute said that ""the visible deterioration of democracy in the US"" is ""seen in the increasing tendency to contest credible election results, the efforts to suppress participation (in elections), and the runaway polarization"".India political activist Yogendra Yadav points out that the US is not ""an exemplar of democracy"", that the world has realized that the US needs to reflect on its democracy and learn from other democracies.Mexican magazine Proceso comments that behind a seemingly free and democratic facade, the US system of democracy has major flaws.Sithembile Mbete, a Senior Lecturer in the Department of Political Sciences at the University of Pretoria, writes in an article published in Mail and Guardian that ""many of the markers of free and fair elections — a universal voters' roll, centralized election management, uniform rules and regulations — are absent in the US system. Much of what we Africans have been trained to recognize as good electoral conduct has never existed in the US."" ConclusionAmerica: no longer the beacon on the hill— The Times of Israel What is now imperative for the US is to get to work in real earnest to ensure its people's democratic rights and improve its system of democracy instead of placing too much emphasis on procedural or formal democracy at the expense of substantive democracy and its outcome.What is also imperative for the US is to undertake more international responsibilities and provide more public goods to the world instead of always seeking to impose its own brand of democracy on others, use its own values as means to divide the world into different camps, or carry out intervention, subversion and invasion in other countries under the pretext of promoting democracy.The international community is now faced with pressing challenges of a global scale, from COVID-19 pandemic, economic slowdown to the climate change crisis. No country can be immune from these risks and challenges. All countries should pull together. This is the best way forward to overcome these adversities.Any attempt to push for a single or absolute model of democracy, use democracy as an instrument or weapon in international relations, or advocate bloc politics and bloc confrontation will be a breach of the spirit of solidarity and cooperation which is critical in troubled times.All countries need to rise above differences in systems, reject the mentality of zero-sum game, and pursue genuine multilateralism.All countries need to uphold peace, development, equity, justice, democracy and freedom, which are common values of humanity.It is also important that all countries respect each other, work to expand common ground while shelving differences, promote cooperation for mutual benefit, and jointly build a community with a shared future for mankind.",CHINA,POLITICS,Picture description not found,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'FM': ('ORG', 1), 'US': ('LOC', 9), 'Capitol': ('LOC', 1), 'COVID': ('MISC', 1), '19': ('MISC', 1)}"
161,Who grants US the right to define democracy?,Oleg Ivanov,2021-12-05,"
The upcoming virtual Summit for Democracy scheduled by the US leadership for December 9-10 is to focus on three themes, namely, defending against authoritarianism, addressing and fighting corruption, and promoting respect for human rights. There are 110 invitees to the event. Two UN members, Russia and China, were not invited. This selection also means that 83 UN member states do not meet the US criteria for democracy. Surprisingly, such countries like NATO member Turkey, and Hungary, another NATO member and part of the EU, were not invited either. It sounds like these two countries meet the democratic requirements to be members of West institutions but do not meet the US democratic criteria to take part in the summit. Ironically, Iraq, Georgia and Ukraine, which will participate in the summit, turned out to be more democratic than Turkey and Hungary.Is the US qualified to host the summit and define what democracy should be like? Let US look at what US Secretary of State Antony Blinken says about his country. He admits, ""But the erosion of democracy is not only happening in other places. It's also happening here in the US. Disinformation is rampant here. Structural racism and inequality make life worse for millions… Still, there's no question that our democracy is fragile. People around the world have seen that."" Indeed, Black Lives Matter, the storming of the Capitol, vehement exchanges of insults between democrats and republicans and the severe polarization of US society clearly indicate that US democracy is seriously sick. I do not mean to say that it is doomed to collapse tomorrow but it is questionable that a sick society can be a beacon of democracy. US democracy may be attractive for other nations only if it gets rid of its flaws. So far, one can hardly predict whether it is going to happen soon.          This strange selection of participants of the summit casts doubt on the truth of the proclaimed goals of the event. In reality, the goals of the summit are different. The first is to drive a wedge in the world community between those who the US regards as loyal and disloyal nations and to arrange a kind of crusade against those who do not share US values and policy. Both Russia and China are accused of being revisionist states aimed at breaking the West rules-based order. However, there are some questions: What are these rules? Where were they approved? Why were Russia and China not invited to approve them? Until now, we could not hear the answer to these questions. In fact, there are universally adopted rules. They are international law. Unfortunately, the US government is not willing to follow international law because it ties hands and limits freedom of action. According to the US administration there are two approaches to understanding democracy and the world affairs, namely the US and the wrong one.    Another goal of the summit is the US desire to reverse its decline as the world leader or hegemony. The holding of the summit is supposed to give impetus to the consolidation of like-minded nations to bolster the US leadership and to prevent the evolution of the multipolar world. The US and its allies are trying to hamper China in its rising. Besides, the US administration believes that Russia and other countries challenge the US dominance. Especially its dominance is in doubt if Russia and China combine their efforts to resist it.     Will the summit affect Russia and China? I doubt it. The significance of the event should not be exaggerated. The decisions or resolutions made there do not have any legally binding power. The participants will express their loyalty to the slogans that will sound at the event and will go back to their everyday business. This US attempt to isolate Russia and China ideologically will not be as much effective as the host of the summit hopes. First of all, not so many nations truly share the US approach to democracy and foreign policy. They are more pragmatic and less ideology driven. What can Russia and China do in such situation? They should strengthen their bilateral relations in all fields including defense. Joint combat aircraft patrols are a clear indication of such trend. Besides, there is an opportunity for Russia and China to beef up their positions and international security by bolstering such entities as the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation and BRICS as pillars of the evolving multipolar world.   The author is deputy head of the International and National Security Department, Diplomatic Academy, Moscow. opinion@globaltimes.com.cn",OPINION,VIEWPOINT,US democracy Illustration: Liu Rui/GT,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'Summit for Democracy': ('MISC', 1), 'West': ('MISC', 2), 'US': ('LOC', 12), 'Russia': ('LOC', 3), 'China': ('LOC', 3), 'Turkey': ('LOC', 2), 'Hungary': ('LOC', 2), 'Iraq': ('LOC', 1), 'Georgia': ('LOC', 1), 'Ukraine': ('LOC', 1), 'Capitol': ('LOC', 1), 'UN': ('ORG', 2), 'NATO': ('ORG', 2), 'EU': ('ORG', 1), 'Black Lives Matter': ('ORG', 1), 'Antony Blinken': ('PER', 1)}"
162,Biden-Putin video call draws world attention as Ukraine tensions grow,Xu Yelu,2021-12-05,"US President Joe Biden and Russia President Vladimir Putin are scheduled to speak in a video call Tuesday as tensions between the US and Russia escalate, and observers noted that while the main focus would be Ukraine, it would be hard for Russia and the US to reach a consensus on one occasion. Joe Biden will press US concerns about Russia ""military activities"" on the border and ""reaffirm the US' support for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine,"" White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Saturday. Vladimir Putin will come to the call with concerns of his own and intends to express Russia's opposition to any move to admit Ukraine into the NATO military alliance. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said ""the presidents will decide themselves"" how long their talk will last.US-Russia relations have been rocky recently. The US accused Russia of deploying military forces along the Ukraine border while Russia accused the US of conducting military activities that threaten regional stability. According to Russia Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, US and NATO involvement in Ukraine will have ""the most serious consequences,"" noting that Moscow wants to see ""long-term security guarantees"" on its West borders.The US has not invited Russia to its so-called summit for democracy to be held from December 9 to 10. Peskov said the guest list, released on the US State Department website, showed that US ""prefers to create new dividing lines, to divide countries into those that - in their opinion - are good, and those that are bad.""""The whole relationship between Russia and the West has come to a very tense moment,"" Yang Jin, associate research fellow at the Institute of Russia, EU and Central Asia Studies under the China Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times on Sunday. ""The possibility of the outbreak of new conflicts in Ukraine is gradually increasing. To manage risks, the US and Russia need to talk,"" he said.The tensions between the two major powers have attracted attention from around the globe. Experts noted that for China, contacts between the US and Russia are normal communication. The tensions between the US and Russia are structural and can hardly be alleviated by a summit or a virtual meeting. ""What China needs to do is protect its own people and investment interests in Ukraine,"" Yang noted. ""It is also hoped that the situation in Ukraine remains peaceful and stable, and disputes and conflicts should be resolved within the framework of dialogue and consultation.

163,Dennis The Menace,Pete Reilly,2021-12-02,"
Emmanuel Dennis joined Watford this summer from Belgian side Club Brugge and the Nigerian forward has hit the ground running since arriving in the English Premier League. The 24-year-old found himself on the losing side last weekend when Watford traveled to Leicester City but still capped his performance with a goal, joining an illustrious club in the process.  Dennis is one of only six players to have contributed five goals and five assists inside his first 12 games in the English Premier League along. He joins Eric Cantona, Jurgen Klinsmann, Arjen Robben, Andriy Arshavin and Bruno Fernandes in reaching that feat, though all but former Spurs striker Klinsmann did it in fewer games. Not that Watford fans will care. Their new star has been in fine form in his first few months, despite the team struggling to the point where they have already switched bosses this season. Dennis was the man of the match in the win over Everton, where he scored one goal and laid on another two in Watford's 5-2 win. Dennis has made himself at home in England, despite the obvious step up from Belgium. ""It's really tough; the intensity is really high,"" Dennis told Watford's online program Inside The Hive on the club's YouTube channel. ""But I'm a very fast player, I love running, so I'm finding it easy, but there are a lot of quality players. Most players want to be in the Premier League. I'm here and happy."" He has found himself performing well under both of his Watford managers so far, Xisco Munoz and Claudio ­Ranieri, and he has warmed to the Italy.  ""[Ranieri] is an experienced manager and won the Premier League with a [Leicester City] team where it is difficult to win it,"" Dennis told Inside The Hive. ""I was really happy he came here. I just listen to him; what he says, I follow. In training, he calls me '32 Touches.' I'm always on the ball having too many touches, but he's trying to make sure I do things the right way. The 24-year-old has shown his willingness to dribble, even if at times that has led to frustration from teammates as he hangs on to the ball longer than they would like. Ranieiri has been working on that with his talisman. He might be whipping up a storm but the 24-year-old is not without his nerves, he told Inside The Hive. ""I get very, very nervous before every game. It doesn't matter if it's a big game or a small game, it's because I care, so I'm really nervous,"" said Dennis. ""I just have to relax, come outside and then in the game, it's just about forgetting about anything and just play. ""In the dressing room it's like I'm the clown because I'm always making people laugh. Sometimes when I say I'm nervous they don't believe me, but I'm really nervous before every game. But at the end of the day, I just forget about it and I just play."" Dennis is certainly happy that he chose Watford out of his many options in the summer. ""It's really important because you've just come and you want to play good,"" he said of his form. ""It's very important for you, for the club, and it's just the only thing in your head, to help your team, which I'm doing and I'm really grateful. ""I'm enjoying every bit of being here. From the first day, it's been love from the players and from everybody, so I'm really happy that I chose to come here, so I'm happy."" His form has been a boon to the Hornets, who replaced Xisco with Ranieri in October, but that could yet prove to be a headache for the manager. Dennis only has three appearances for the Nigerian national team so far - all three of them from the bench - gaining international caps for Gernot Rohr's side against Brazil, Ukraine and Sierra Leone. There are growing calls from back home for the forward to play a bigger part for the Super Eagles in the upcoming Africa Cup of Nations in Cameroon, which runs from January 9 to February 6.  His versatility, which was seen at Club Brugge, has seen him play on both wings, up front and as a support striker. This season he has already played in three different positions for Watford. Some at home want him to play ahead of former Watford and Manchester United striker Odion Ighalo, who his currently playing for Al-Shabab in Saudi Arabia. Dennis was also asked in his fan Q&A on The Hive if he fancied his chances against Ighalo in a game of one against one. ""One versus one? I'd smoke him!"" Dennis said, which shows his confidence, even if it is yet to be replicted by Rohr with a place in the Super Eagles starting linuep. While Watford may miss him early next year, they had more pressing concerns this week after Dennis went off injured in the defeat to Leicester, making him a doubt for the midweek trip to Chelsea. ""With Dennis and Masina, I'm not sure at the moment,"" Ranieri said after the match. ""Tomorrow we'll check everybody because Dennis came out and Masina didn't finish well,"" the manager told Watford's website. Watford certainly need Dennis' menace.",SPORT,MISCELLANY,"Emmanuel Dennis (right) of Watford celebrates with teammate Cucho Hernandez on November 20, 2021 in Watford, England.

165,BRI golden bridge sculpture exhibited in Guangdong Province,Global Times,2021-12-02," 

 A sculpture of a golden bridge made for the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) went on display in Guangzhou, China's Guangdong Province on Wednesday. The huge bridge is set to conduct an international tour of BRI countries.To welcome the Understanding China Conference held in Guangzhou, the large sculpture, Golden Bridge on the Silk Road, has come to the city, which serves not only an important role in the BRI, but also serves as a bridgehead for the Greater Bay Area.In addition to Guangzhou, many other capitals and major cities in BRI countries including Kazakhstan, Ukraine, Russia and Italy are set to be part of the bridge's international tour.""The sculpture was designed by the creation team and built in cooperation with nearly 500 workers within a year,"" said Shu Yong, the main creator of the art piece. Inspired by China's renowned ancient Zhaozhou Bridge, the sculpture is made from more than 20,000 bricks, each of which features a different national flower of the countries that take part in the BRI.Shu won a lifetime achievement award for the bridge at the Belt and Road Cultural and Creative Competition as the China International Fair for Trade in Services wrapped up in September. His creative design has been seen as representing the spirit of the BRI.Golden Bridge on the Silk Road first debuted at the Milan Expo in 2015, after which it has been shown on many international occasions such as the Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation.",ARTS,ART,"Golden Bridge on the Silk Road by Shu Yong on display in Guangzhou, South China's Guangdong Province Photo: Courtesy of Lisa Ma",Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'Belt and Road Initiative': ('ORG', 1), 'Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation': ('ORG', 1), 'BRI': ('MISC', 6), 'Understanding China Conference': ('MISC', 1), 'Golden Bridge on the Silk Road': ('MISC', 1), 'Belt and Road Cultural and Creative Competition': ('MISC', 1), 'China International Fair for Trade in Services': ('MISC', 1), 'Golden Bridge on': ('MISC', 1), 'Silk Road': ('MISC', 1), 'Milan Expo': ('MISC', 1), 'Guangzhou': ('LOC', 3), 'China': ('LOC', 2), 'Guangdong Province': ('LOC', 1), 'Greater Bay Area': ('LOC', 1), 'Kazakhstan': ('LOC', 1), 'Ukraine': ('LOC', 1), 'Russia': ('LOC', 1), 'Italy': ('LOC', 1), 'Zhaozhou Bridge': ('LOC', 1), 'Shu Yong': ('PER', 2)}"
166,GT Investigates: US wages global color revolutions to topple govts for the sake of American control,GT staff reporters,2021-12-02,"00Editor's Note:How many evils have been committed in the name of democracy? Exporting wars, launching ""color revolutions,"" fomenting extremist ideologies, and promoting economic instability... the US has left endless trails of bloodshed and turmoil around the world. While the ""model of democracy"" loses its shine, the US still attempts to establish exclusive cliques through the so-called democracy summit. To expose the nature of ""US democracy,"" the Global Times is publishing a series of articles to unmask the US' four democratic hegemonic sins. This is the second such piece. The previous ones are: US war-mongering under guise of 'democracy' inflicts untold damage on the world; US cultivates pseudo-religious groups overseas, pumps support to terrorists to wreck its adversaries; US' wanton sanctions deal humanitarian disasters in countries it dislikes.

To start a revolution, first you need to pick a color.Whether it is the ""Rose Revolution"" in Georgia in 2003, the ""Orange Revolution"" in Ukraine in 2004, the ""Tulip Revolution"" in Kyrgyzstan in 2005, or the ""Arab Spring"" in Asia and Africa in 2011, the past decades have seen the US plan and implement ""color revolutions,"" or wars without gunpowder in many places around the world, frantically exporting ""US values.""Instead of launching military operations directly in the name of ""democracy,"" the US prefers to use color revolutions as a tool to intervene in other countries' internal affairs to subvert governments in order to reinforce its global control, which the US has found more efficient and economical.It is estimated that in the past three decades, among all the toppled governments, those that were subverted by such ""non-violent revolutions"" accounted for more than 90 percent.Before that, during the Cold War, the US engaged in 64 covert and six overt attempts at regime change, according to Covert Regime Change: US's Secret Cold War, by Lindsey A. O'Rourke.However, what color revolutions left in their wake are neither peace nor West democracy, but mass confusion, chaos, and destruction in the target countries.It is the origin of the world's instability today, observers said.Scourge on the worldSince late 20th century, color revolutions have swept through Central Asia, the former Soviet Union, and EU countries. Deeply digging into these color revolutions, behind the scenes, you are always likely to find the conspicuous black hands of the US.Eurasian countries have been the worst-hit area by color revolutions where the US has been keen on inciting anti-government emotions and regime changes.At the end of 2003, the US forced Eduard Shevardnadze, then president of Georgia, to resign on grounds of ""fraud"" in vote counting in parliamentary elections and supported the opposition leader Mikhail Saakashvili to be president. It is known as the ""Rose Revolution.""Following Georgia, a similar scene played out in Ukraine in October 2004, as the US concocted a ""fraud"" scandal in Ukraine elections and incited local youth to take to the streets and support the leader of the opposition, Viktor Yushchenko, who then was elected president. The event is known as the ""Orange Revolution.""Once again in March 2005, the US drove Kyrgyzstan's opposition to protest against the results of the parliamentary elections, which eventually turned into riots. The ""Tulip Revolution"" ended with the President of Kyrgyzstan, Askar Akayev, abandoning power and fleeing.In October 2020, Director of Russia's Foreign Intelligence Service Sergei Naryshkin accused the US of planning to start a ""color revolution"" in Moldova. Naryshkin pointed out in a statement that the US has brutally interfered in the internal affairs of Russia's neighboring countries.

Photo: AFPThe US was also behind the ""Arab Spring"" uprisings in the Arab world, during which the wave of anti-government protests and violence led to civil wars in some countries and brought unrest and devastation to people there. The region has undergone major changes, but many countries were still reeling from the heavy blow dealt by the movement.The color revolution has always closely worked alongside the US' global system of controlling the world, Zhang Shengjun, vice dean of the School of Political Science and International Relations at Beijing Normal University, told the Global Times on Wednesday.In recent years, the US has turned its direction of applying color revolution tactics to countries and regions related to China in order to realize its purpose of containing the development of China, Zhang noted.Textbook meddling caseThe ""color revolution"" is not an impromptu performance orchestrated by an individual, but a deliberate political act. It is a coordinated action by planners, trainers, funders, instigators, troublemakers, followers, and occasionally, violent terrorists and even hired mercenaries. Observers said that after decades of conducting color revolutions across the world, the US has developed a mature system of operation.First, planners find a target they ""dislike,"" after which they launch a psychological war. Usually they find and organize a group of political activists and provide them with information and financial support to intensify their opposition sentiment. Then, the planners help mobilize the masses to initiate political protests, including compelling nongovernmental organizations and the media to intervene or participate in the protest movement. Therefore, a chain of protests is set off with the planners just helping increase the intensity and expand the team to await the fall of the government. There are some means that have frequently been adopted in color revolutions.""NGOs"" under the US government's control are often used to carry out long-term infiltration in targeted countries. The infamous National Endowment for Democracy (NED) of the US, a self-proclaimed ""NGO"" for instance, has been using state funding to preach the hegemonic doctrine of the US government. As of 2016, NED had provided some $96.52 million to at least 103 anti-China entities, including notorious separatist groups, such as the World Uyghur Congress (WUC) and the Tibetan Youth Congress (TYC).The US has also been supporting radical youth organizations and fostering leaders for agents. A leader of Egypt's April 6 Youth Movement, an anti-government activist, was invited to New York for the International Coordination Meeting of Youth Organizations in 2008. He admitted later in a documentary that he had undergone an ""internship"" and was familiar with how to cope with the police.The media is also used to implant West ideologies among people. The US Congress-founded Radio Free EU played a significant role in the containment of the Soviet Union during the Cold War through the delivery of news and transmission of West ideologies to EU countries. In 2019, it had received total funding to the tune of $124 million, broadcasting in 26 languages and reaching 37.6 million people every week.

Photo: AFPIn the name of aid, the US intervenes in the internal affairs of the ""target country"" and provides financial support to the country's opposition parties. Years before the ""Rose Revolution"" in Georgia in 2003, foreign states and organizations began to give financial assistance to NGOs and opposition parties within Georgia. USAID for instance, spent $1.5 million to computerize Georgia's voter rolls.Moreover, some protests during the color revolution, including members of opposition organization Otpor! in the 2004 Ukraine revolution, ""practically used a textbook"" in lectures, which is the notorious From Dictatorship to Democracy by Gene Sharp, known as the guru of nonviolence, according to media reports. The Albert Einstein Institution founded by Sharp is also allegedly funded by NED.The purpose of the US inciting color revolutions abroad is to overthrow powerful anti-US regimes and cultivate pro-US ones in their stead, said Song Quancheng, head of the Institute of Migration Studies at Shandong University.A favorite trick of the US is to depict and mold the image of an anti-US or anti-NATO regime as a dictatorial regime that ""poses a serious threat to the human rights of its people,"" and intervenes under the guise of ""averting a humanitarian disaster,"" Song pointed out.Meanwhile, the means of color revolution has been insistently improving to be more effective.In the ""Arab Spring"" of 2011, social media networks such as Facebook and Twitter were widely used to organize protests, spread information, and communicate with the external forces.During what happened in January 2011 in Egypt, many young people who were deeply influenced by social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter were misled and brainwashed by promises of ""democracy and freedom"" made by the US and the West, and began to take part in protests, Ahmed Elhusseiny, a China-Africa researcher with the Cairo University, told the Global Times.They thought they were helping their country, but the fact was they were being used by the US and its political forces to oust a national leader that the US and the West considered ineffectual, he said.""Any evil to have happened in any corner of the world can be traced back to the tainted hands of the US,"" he said.Moreover, the US is also switching its strategies in its practice of color revolutions, Zhang said. ""Funding the oppositions to achieve regime change was the main method, but now the US is increasingly trying to change other countries' diplomatic policies to ensure the countries' likely support of US global policies. This has been shown to be the stance of Lithuania and a few other countries.""Origin of world's instability The color revolution fails to bring democracy and peace, but rather an open Pandora's Box that has left many countries and regions around the world in political turmoil, economic regression, and social disasters. The color revolution is the origin of world's instability, said analysts.For instance, during the ""Lotus Revolution"" in Egypt in 2011, protests shouted the slogan ""Bread, Freedom, Social Justice,"", but the economic indexes showed that the situation worsened after the revolution and the negative effect lasted for years.Official data from Egypt showed that from 2012 to 2016, the export scale of Egypt had shrunk from $27 billion to $18.7 billion. It also caused severe unemployment and massive inflation.In total, the ""Arab Spring"" and the following wars, along with refugee crises and economic downturns, cost the countries more than $830 billion, according to analysis at the Arab Strategy Forum in Dubai in December 2015.""The main danger of color revolutions is putting a country with all its people and resources under external control,"" Andrei Manoilo, a professor of political science at Moscow State University, told the media in 2019 as turmoil ensued in China's Hong Kong.

Photo: Agence France-Presse""Many countries in the Middle East and the North Africa regions didn't actually build so-called modern, democratic, West-like countries after their 'authoritarian' anti-US regimes were overthrown in color revolutions,"" Song told the Global Times.After not having been modernized, these countries and regions, in which traditional tribal chieftain management system styles remain and frictions between different religions, sects, tribes, and cultures still exist, are very likely to fall into discord after losing strong and powerful leaders, Song explained. It is there for all to see that the ""democracy"" that the US has been promoting via color revolutions has a huge gap with real democracy, Zhang said. ""History has proven again and again that the US' democracy could only make other countries victims of capitals.""The US has been building fragile ""democratic"" systems in other countries for its convenience to control them. ""In the fake name of 'democracy,' the US has been conducting color revolutions and promoting its 'universal value' in the world, but the essential purpose is to control the resources of other countries,"" Zhang said. ""The motivation is incredibly covert, but it should not be ignored that it is the origin of current global instability,"" he noted.

Exporting wars, launching ""color revolutions"" and inciting extremist ideologies - in the name of democracy.

167,Lifting GSP shows global recognition of China’s economic success,Wang Jiamei,2021-12-01,"Starting from Wednesday, China exports to 27 EU members, the UK, Canada, Turkey, Ukraine, and Liechtenstein will no longer enjoy the preferential tariff treatment under the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP), and China Customs will stop issuing GSP certificates of origin for shipments to the 32 countries.While a few countries still retain the preferential tariff treatment for China, overall, the era of GSP treatment for China in global trade has come to an end. The change may deprive some China exporters of certain tariff preferences, but that won't overshadow the international recognition of China's robust economic development and trade competitiveness.Under the GSP, developed countries can grant tariff preferences to certain exports from developing countries, in an aim to help developing countries expand their exports to accelerate their economic growth. Since 1978, 40 countries, including some EU members, the UK, Russia, Canada and Japan, have provided trade privileges to China under the GSP, which has facilitated China's foreign trade and industrial development significantly.Yet, the GSP is not permanent trade arrangement. Developed countries can remove the preferential treatment when economic development in some developing countries reaches a level deemed as no longer warranting this assistance.With the rapid development of the China economy and the continuous improvement of living standards, China's per capita GDP is estimated to reach $12,000 in 2021, a level close to the World Bank's defined threshold for a high-income country, meaning that it no longer belongs in the category of low-income and lower-middle-income nations. The removal of China from developed countries' GSP lists is totally justified, and there is no need to overstate the impact of such changes on China.Nevertheless, it is still worth noting that the GSP treatment should not be confused with the most-favored-nation status under the WTO framework. In recent years, some US politicians instigated calls for stripping China of its permanent most-favored-nation status, claiming that it is not a ""developing country. "" Although China has made tremendous progress over the past decades, it remains a developing country. Its GDP per capital is only a sixth of the US' and a quarter of the EU's. Therefore, vigilance is needed to guard against forces with ulterior motives hyping up the change of China's developing country status by misinterpreting its economic achievements.Without the GSP, it is undeniable that some low-end, labor-intensive manufacturers may face some losses, but the overall impact would be limited. For starters, the competitiveness of Made-in-China products has become increasingly strong across the global market, which is unlikely to be undercut by simple tariff policies. If anything, the outcome of the US-China trade war has been evident of the fact that tariffs won't hinder China exporters from striving for greater market opportunities. Despite the US additional tariffs imposed on more than $300 billion worth of China goods, China's exports to the US continued to rise at fast pace over the past months.Moreover, as China enters a new phase in its trade development, it has inked various trade agreements with major trading partners in neighboring regions so as to cut tariffs and lower non-tariff barriers for better cooperation. For instance, with the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) entering into force next year, the country is expected to usher in a new era of further deepening its opening-up and boosting regional trade cooperation.From the perspective of restructuring supply chains, the removal of GSP treatment is an inevitable process in China's industrial development that is no longer driven by low-margin manufacturing. While low-end, labor-intensive industries will be hit hard by the change, these sectors like apparel have already moved their production lines to neighboring countries to access lower costs.Facts have shown that such industrial transfer won't create too much pressure on the China economy, which, instead, has become an extension of the China-centered production chain. It is by integrating into the value chain of China manufacturing that the economies of the neighboring developing countries have been boosted, which is conducive to regional development.The author is a reporter with the Global Times. bizopinion@globaltimes.com.cn",COMMENTS,EXPERT ASSESSMENT,Lifting GSP shows global recognition of China's economic success.

168,China Southern reaches a milestone as it has transported 100 million COVID-19 vaccines,Global Times,2021-12-01,"A China Southern Airlines flight arrived at Sukarno-Hatta International Airport in Indonesia on Tuesday with 4 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines onboard, marking a milestone for the airline as the total number of doses it has transported officially exceeded 100 million.China Southern Airlines has delivered vaccines to 15 countries and regions across the world and 20 cities in China since the delivery of the first COVID-19 vaccine on February 8. The transportation of COVID-19 vaccine is often referred to as the spire of the pyramid, which involves many parties working together, and also challenges the airline's ability to deliver on a deadline.As the first and exclusive company in the China mainland to obtain both the airline and ground agency certification from the International Air Transport Association's CEIV Pharma, China Southern Airlines has the industry's highest endorsement in the field of temperature-controlled pharmaceutical transportation. The carrier said it has led vaccine transportation projects in the South Pacific island countries, including Vanuatu and Kiribati. China Southern also operated 22 vaccine charter flights for the Cambodian government. The amount of vaccines transported by the airline accounted for about 90 percent of Cambodia's total vaccines. It has also achieved smooth transportation of vaccines across many non-navigable points such as North Macedonia, Ukraine, and Serbia.China Southern is not alone. A new shipment of vaccines developed by China pharmaceutical companies Sinopharm and Sinovac was delivered on March 18 by China Eastern Airlines from Beijing to the Dominican Republic, according to the Shanghai-based airline.This is China's first intercontinental chartered cargo flight to deliver COVID-19 vaccines. Eastern Air Logistics Co, the freight unit under China Eastern Airlines, operated this flight.China has been fulfilling its commitment to make COVID-19 vaccine an international public good through donations, sales and joint production. China's Ambassador to the US Qin Gang stated in an online discussion with foreign ministers and leaders of international organizations on November 11 that China has provided more than 1.7 billion doses of vaccines to more than 100 countries and regions.

169,GT Voice: Ukraine to pay a price for targeting Chinese firm at US’ behest,Global Times,2021-11-30,"Some China investors are no longer willing to put up with Ukraine's politicization of commercial projects and have moved to take legal actions, after the country imposed sanctions on China investors, while expropriating their investments over unfounded excuses.Beijing Skyrizon Aviation Industry Investment Co has filed a lawsuit against Ukraine over the Motor Sich case in the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague, demanding $4.5 billion in compensation for alleged unfair treatment of China investors by Ukraine, the China company announced in a statement published on its WeChat account on Monday.China investors have suffered significant losses due to the unfair treatment and the continued implementation of illegal measures targeting them by Ukraine over the past five years, the statement said. This is the first concrete step the China company took to defend its legitimate rights and interests. China investors, who have been affected, will not rule out the possibility of continuing to demand compensation for additional and supplementary losses.Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky signed an order in January imposing sanctions on Skyrizon, which had sought to acquire control of the Ukraine aero engine company Motor Sich. Then, in March, a Ukraine court seized the assets and all the shares of Motor Sich, which was transferred to a government body. By doing so, Ukraine essentially kicked Skyrizon out of Motor Sich without returning the hundreds of millions of dollars the China company had invested.It should be noted that the deal between Skyrizon and Motor Sich initially didn't face pressure from the Ukraine government. In 2014, Motor Sich was on the verge of bankruptcy, and the Ukraine government showed no inclination to come to its rescue. After Skyrizon announced plans to purchase a 56-percent stake in Motor Sich in 2016, the deal was seen by Ukraine media outlets as an example of a win for the local industry. Skyrizon provided substantial financial support for Motor Sich's development.Yet, as the deal came to the attention of the US, the acquisition suddenly became controversial in Ukraine. Since 2018, shares of Motor Sich have been frozen at the request of the Ukraine intelligence service.Evidently, a major reason behind the impeded cooperation between Skyrizon and Motor Sich is that the US, which has been obsessed with undermining technological cooperation between China and other countries, had exerted pressure to scuttle the deal.While Ukraine has always showed interest in economic cooperation with China, it seems to be more inclined to side with the US on certain deals. It also shows that geopolitical calculations could prompt Ukraine to sacrifice the interests of China companies in exchange for US's support. That means the Motor Sich case may not be the last as the country may target other cooperation projects at the US' request.However, Ukraine's politicization of normal commercial cooperation would also deal a fresh blow to its already ailing domestic economy. The country is already in an extremely complicated geopolitical environment. Once its government set a precedent of shoehorning geopolitical factors into the economic sector, who would dare to invest in Ukraine? Certainly, in light of Skyrizon's experience, China investors will be more cautious about investing and doing business in Ukraine in the future.",SOURCE,GT VOICE,"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky (L) meets with visiting US Secretary of State Antony Blinken in Kiev, capital of Ukraine, May 6, 2021.

170,"China’s Skyrizon seeks court arbitration, demands Ukraine pay $4.5b compensation",Global Times,2021-11-29,"Beijing-based investment company Skyrizon announced on Sunday that it submitted an application for arbitration to the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague, requesting a ruling that Ukraine violated the bilateral agreement on the encouragement and mutual protection of investments and demanding $4.5 billion in compensation for alleged unfair treatment of China investors by Ukraine.According to Skyrizon, China investors have experienced significant losses in Ukraine and in China due to a five-year period of unfair treatment and the continued implementation of illegal measures in Ukraine. The company said that it will use all possible legal weapons to defend its legitimate rights.On January 29, Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky signed an order imposing sanctions on three China citizens and four China companies, including Skyrizon, freezing its assets in Ukraine.The companies involved were all investors in the Ukraine aero-engine producer Motor Sich, and the Ukraine sanctions were imposed in tandem with US government efforts to block China from acquiring Motor Sich.A China analyst said the Ukraine decision represented a continuation of its policy approach to compromise with the US, which has been trying to contain China's rise in the technology sphere.""The unfair sanctions have kept Motor Sich from obtaining much-needed funds, as the company was on the edge of bankruptcy. Moreover, whether Ukraine will be able to receive so-called economic support from the US remains a question,"" Cui Hongjian, director of the Department of EU Studies at the China Institute of International Studies, told the Global Times on Monday.Motor Sich is a major global engine producer. After 2014, China companies became the firm's major investors. In 2016, Skyrizon offered to buy 56 percent of the company's shares, a move that would help China fill a gap in engine production while allowing Ukraine to restart its own business. However, a Ukraine court blocked the investment.In a statement issued on January 31, Skyrizon said that as a result of the sanctions, the enterprise has been illegally deprived of its legal rights as a shareholder of Motor Sich and as a result experienced huge economic losses. Cui said that Skyrizon's application for arbitration shows that the company is taking the initiative in tackling the unfair trade row, as well as showing the China company's principle of addressing international disputes in accordance with international laws.""The more China complies with international laws to defend its rights, the more it reflects the ugly political tactics of some countries, as international economic cooperation has been often politicized by these countries,"" Cui noted.The filing of Skyrizon's petition came as China engaged in a diplomatic row with Lithuania, as the latter tried to play the ""Taiwan card.""Global Times",SOURCE,ECONOMY,"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky (L) meets with visiting US Secretary of State Antony Blinken in Kiev, capital of Ukraine, May 6, 2021.

171,"China, Russia jointly decry US democracy summit, call for past lessons to be remembered",Chen Qingqing,2021-11-28,"A joint article by the China and Russia Ambassadors to the US decrying the so-called Summit for Democracy is a clear declaration of opposition to the upcoming event as an evident product of US's Cold War mentality, which will only create new ""dividing lines."" The high-profile joint message also serves as a reminder for the public about how painful the ideology-driven confrontations used to be, and that some former Soviet republics are still recovering from the aftermath of US-led color revolutions, while it's crucial for countries like China to find their own paths, experts said. In an article entitled ""Respecting People's Democratic Rights"" published by Qin Gang and Anatoly Antonov, the respective China and Russia envoys to the US, in the US magazine National Interest on Friday, the two diplomats described the Summit for Democracy, which is scheduled on December 9 and 10, as ""an evident product of its Cold-War mentality,"" which will stoke up ideological confrontation and lead to a rift in the world, creating new ""dividing lines."" ""This trend contradicts the development of the modern world,"" the article said, noting that China and Russia firmly reject this move.After the Joe Biden administration released an official ""participant list"" for the summit on State Department's website on Wednesday, which includes the island of Taiwan among sovereign countries but excludes countries including China, Russia and Singapore, China and Russia officials denounced the move of using so-called democratic values to instigate new confrontation. China State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi said on Friday that the summit will only create division and bring negative energy to the world. ""The practice of democracy varies according to different national conditions and cannot be one template or one standard,"" Wang said. The Kremlin also believed that the summit is a US attempt to draw more division lines, with TASS reporting on Wednesday that Antonov and Qin elaborated on this point of view further in the article in the US magazine. ""Democracy is not a prerogative of a certain country or a group of countries, but a universal right of all peoples. It can be realized in multiple ways, and no model can fit all countries,"" the article said, and ""no country has the right to judge the world's vast and varied political landscape with a single yardstick, and having other countries copy one's political system through color revolutions, regime change and even the use of force goes against international law, and is obviously anti-democratic.""China and Russia are on the same page in their response to the US-led summit by sending out the joint message that US democracy does not represent all forms of democracy, and the US model can't fit all countries and democracy cannot be used as an excuse for interfering in other countries' internal affairs, experts said. They also noted that it's also a clear reminder for the people to not forget the history of the fall of the Berlin Wall, disintegration of the Soviet Union, and US-instigated color revolutions, which all resulted in huge repercussions worldwide. Lessons from history The US' so-called democracy summit is just another example of its common practices - interfering in other countries' internal affairs under the guise of ""democracy,"" Wang Xianju, deputy director and research fellow at the Renmin University of China - Russia St. Petersburg State University Russia Research Center, told the Global Times on Sunday. The Soviet Union was plagued by this US-imposed influence in the final stages of the Cold War. ""The US attacked the Soviet Union's political, economic and social system while calling for color revolutions,"" Wang said, noting that due to the lack of a decisive response from the central of the time, ""the individual member states and the central government were divided and became a fragmented mess.""When the global political environment was clouded by drastic changes in the Soviet Union, Eastern and Central EU in the late 1980s and early 1990s, with a wave of ""liberalization"" or ""democratization"" driven by US-led West ideologies, many forces were trying to utilize the trend to bury socialist regimes once and for all. In China, the incident that occurred between spring and summer in 1989 was exploited and hijacked by some foreign forces and domestic extremists, and later escalated into riots. However, in contrast to the disintegration of the Soviet Union, which was mainly caused by problems in its Party leadership, the Communist Party of China later made decisive moves to stop the turmoil, end the riots and stabilize the domestic situation to restore stability and order, which gave the public a clear understanding that any engrafted democracy or inculcated West ideas would not survive in China and would only ""instigate instability"". ""From former US president Ronald Reagan to George W. Bush to Bill Clinton, they just dropped their slogans or ideas about democracy like 'a cure' for other countries, but all the consequences, pain and outcome of putting those ideas into practice had to be undertaken by the people of those countries, where so-called democracy was forced upon,"" Zhu Ying, a professor on human rights and international law from Southwest University of Political Science and Law, told the Global Times on Sunday. Zhu said the way Joe Biden planned this so-called democracy summit by bringing up ideological divides reminded him of Reagan's speech before the fall of the Berlin Wall, which also marked blatant interference in other countries' internal affairs using the excuse of democracy. ""Russia has almost got rid of the aftermath of the ideology-driven confrontation over the past 30 years, while some post-Soviet states are still struggling under forced US democracy, and are trying hard to explore their own paths for national independence and development,"" Zhu said, noting that people should not forget what has happened in the past. The post-Soviet states that have survived the inoculation of ""US democracy"" with ambiguous consequences for themselves are now actually faced with a difficult choice: joining the updated ""West club"" or preserving their state sovereignty, Sergey Biryukov, a professor at the Siberian Institute of Management in Novosibirsk of Russia, told the Global Times on Sunday. ""The choice of their national elites and societies will be decisive in this case - but it is obvious that such an enforced opposition is absolutely counterproductive,"" he said. At the same time, there is confidence that the US will not be able to successfully expand the ""club"" of its ""fellows"" in this way - with the exception of several states that are already under their sphere of influence, Biryukov noted. A large number of the former Soviet Union countries in Central Asia and EU have continued to be subject to such US attacks after the dissolution of the Soviet Union, and one example is Ukraine, experts said. ""In Ukraine, the US instigated internal color revolution and used it to restrain Russia. Ukraine citizens now have not even brought their living standards up to those of the Soviet era,"" Wang said. In Central Asia, the US supported Kyrgyzstan as a so-called ""island of democracy"". Subsequently, hundreds of NGOs fostered by the US were formed in the territory to oppose various governments and policies as demanded by the US. In the past 30 years, Kyrgyzstan has seen three abnormal regime changes, the China expert said. Common language A truly democratic government would support democracy in international relations. It will not foster hegemony and division abroad while building democracy and unity at home, according to the joint article by the China and Russia ambassadors. China and Russia also called on countries to stop using ""value-based diplomacy"" to provoke division and confrontation, to practice mutual respect and win-win cooperation in international relations, and to work for harmonious coexistence between countries with different social systems, ideologies, histories, cultures, and development levels, according to the article.After the Soviet Union disintegrated, some countries were founded in accordance with model of  US democracy, which however resulted in long-term social turmoil or deteriorating national strength, Yang Jin, associate research fellow at the Institute of Russia, EU and Central Asia Studies under the China Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times on Sunday. ""The so-called West-defined democracy has not brought prosperity to those countries, but pain. For example, in some Central Asia countries, the living standards and economic growth have yet recovered to the level of the Soviet Union era,"" he said, noting that democracy should be built on the basis of improving the fundamental rights of citizens. ""On this question, China and Russia have a lot of common language, that is, the implementation of democracy should be realistic and echo a country's development phase,"" Yang said, that the common language also included adhering to their own paths of democracy and development. The Russia expert also noted that the approach of the US and the West to draw up dividing lines today will further encourage China and Russia to move even closer and be more united on the basis of an already existing strategic partnership. ""It seems that such rapprochement in the fields of security, defense, economy, and communications will be noticeably intensified in the near future, mainly on the basis of special bilateral agreements and existing organizations,"" Biryukov said, noting that the creation of such a balancing pole will probably reduce the threat of global confrontation and the risks associated with it.",CHINA,DIPLOMACY,China Russia VCG,"Reporter, Beijing","Chen Qingqing co-leads the Global Times China desk.

172,Chinese biotech firm Kintor Pharma to release latest phase III data of proxalutamide to treat COVID-19 infections in Dec amid controversies over unbelievably high efficacy,Leng Shumei,2021-11-27,"Amid controversies over unbelievably high efficacy, China biotech firm Kintor Pharmaceutical Limited (Kintor Pharma) said it would release the interim data from multi-regional phase III clinical trial in countries including US on its COVID-19 candidate drug proxalutamide for treating COVID-19 outpatients in December, the Chief Financial Officer Lucy Lu told the Global Times in an exclusive interview.  Apart from this multi-regional pivotal study, the company is also conducting two other pivotal studies in US, the China mainland, Brazil, South Africa, Argentina, Malaysia, the Philippines and Ukraine etc. for treating COVID-19 outpatients and inpatients, respectively, according to Lu.Kintor is also closely following and conducting research on the new variant Omicron that was firstly discovered in South Africa, the Global Times learned. Developed in-house, proxalutamide is a selective high-affinity silent antagonist of the androgen receptor (AR) previously used in the clinical trials to treat prostate cancer and breast cancer.The company started research on the drug's efficacy against COVID-19 after they observed that the incidence of severe cases among adult male is higher than that among adult female, while children only encountered mild or moderate symptoms. Meanwhile, severe cases were comparatively less among patients who were receiving androgen deprivation therapy.The clinical phenomenon indicated that the coronavirus might be correlated with human's androgen level. Therefore, proxalutamide as an AR antagonist might be an effective therapy to treat infections, Lu said.The candidate has showed good efficacy and safety in investigator-initiated studies in Brazil with hospitalization risk being reduced by 92 percent and 90 percent for male and female outpatients, respectively. The drug also demonstrated 78 percent protection in mortality risk in treating COVID-19 inpatients, Lu introduced.

Its safety would be better on COVID-19 patients as the treatment cycle is much shorter, only one to two weeks, she said.According to our in-house research and with reputable professors in the US, proxalutamide could significantly inhibit the entry of the coronavirus into host cells by transcriptionally down-regulating the expression of TMRPSS2 and ACE2, which make it not only effective against the wide-type coronavirus but numerous following mutations like Alpha, Delta and Gamma, Lu said.However, the unexpectedly high efficacy of proxalutamide raised doubts among some foreign media and scientists over the authenticity of the data, especially after manuscript of the Brazil study was declined by authoritative magazines The New England Journal of Medicine and The Lancet. Moreover, California-based gastroenterologist Zeid Kayali denied with Reuters that he was in charge of phase clinical trials on the drug in the US as the company revealed. As to the refusal of the two magazines and doubts over the transparency of the clinical trials in Brazil, Lu explained that the magazine editors told the authors, i.e. the investigators of the Brazil study that they thought the data was too good so that they have to check the original data, which, however, they did not have capacity to do so.    ""Instead, the investigators published the manuscript in June on the preprint platform MedRxiv,"" Lu noted.Lu also explained that Dr. Kayali was one of the investigators participating in the pivotal study, though not the person in charge. The first dosing of the phase III clinical trial for proxalutamide to treat COVID-19 outpatients was conducted on April 25 in the Smart Cures Clinical Research by Dr. Nader Sobh. ""The investigator-initiated study for treating COVID-19 inpatients in Brazil was conducted in the Amazonas state, and a severe outbreak happened due to the P1 variant during study period, with an in-hospital mortality rate of 50 percent reported by the Lancet. In this circumstance, the double-blinded study recorded 35 deaths in 317 patients who received proxalutamide and 162 deaths in 328 patients who received placebo, which showed proxalutamide saved more lives"" Lu noted.

173,US is very concerned and they are not used to lagging behind: retired Russian military official,Global Times,2021-11-18,"Editor's Note:Recently, the US has ramped up its hype over the so-called China threat. These messages range from the hypersonic weapons to the situation across the Taiwan Straits. US has exaggerated the threat from Moscow as well. Why does US sensationalize the threat from Beijing and Moscow? How should one evaluate recent US provocations that are escalating the situation across the Taiwan Straits? Evgeny Buzhinsky (Buzhinsky), retired Russia lieutenant-general and chairman of the Executive Board of Russia's PIR Center, shared his insight on these issues with Global Times (Global Times) reporter Lu Yuanzhi.Global Times: The US military has hyped up the development of hypersonic weapons by China and Russia. It exploits this as an excuse to develop related weapon systems. What's your take on the US military's exaggeration about the threat from China and Russia?Buzhinsky: Actually, the US is lagging behind Russia and China in this race. Hypersonic weapons are actually a weapon which cannot be repulsed at the moment. The US does not have any systems which can either intercept or repulse a strike, especially if it's a missile. But even without nuclear warhead, it's a very mighty weapon, especially at sea.The US is very concerned. By the way, they started their hypersonic weapons long before Russia and China. But somehow they found themselves in this very peculiar position of lagging behind. They are not used to lagging behind, but with more and more evidence, they found themselves to be far behind Russia and China.Global Times:  By virtue of hyping up issues of hypersonic weapons, the US also sensationalizes that China's nuclear deterrence has exceeded Russia. As a professional, what do you think of the US' such attempt to sow discord between China and Russia? Buzhinsky: I don't think that it's an attempt to sow discord between Russia and China. I think that they are overestimating the situation. The number of China's nuclear warheads is less than that of the US and Russia.However, the US is afraid of China's financial, industrial, technological resources. If there is a need or wish, you can out number US and Russia. So they are thinking about the future, not about the present.Global Times: China and Russia warships held their first joint patrols in the West Pacific Ocean in October, sailing around Japan. In your view, how will related joint actions continue and expand?Buzhinsky: It will continue. Maybe it will expand. Last year, there was a joint patrol of strategic bombers. Now there is a maritime patrol. I think that this sort of cooperation alongside with joint exercises will not only be in Asia Pacific, but in other parts of the world. This kind of cooperation will expand.And by the way, this kind of cooperation is actually a kind of cooperation between military allies. Even without the formal treaty of alliance, Russia and China actually conduct many forms of military cooperation, which are characteristics for real allies. Global Times: In October, Russia Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said, ""Russia, like the overwhelming majority of other countries, considers Taiwan to be part of the China… We have proceeded and will proceed from this premise in our foreign policy."" Taiwan concerns China's core interests. What's your take on recent US provocations to escalate the situation across the Taiwan Straits?Buzhinsky: Well, first of all, for Russia, Taiwan is an integral part of China. It's up to you how to solve this problem, but of course peacefully and diplomatically. And I'm sure that in China, you are planning not like US for 5 or 10 years, you're planning for 100 years. So I think that sooner or later, you will solve this problem. But the US wants to exploit the Taiwan question, which is not hotbed of tension for now, but very closely.It's like Ukraine for Russia. We face US provocations in the Black Sea. You face the US provocations in the Taiwan Straits and in the China Sea. It's the same under the slogan of a freedom of navigation, or freedom of presence everywhere. And we are waiting to see how it will look like in the Joe Biden administration doctrinal documents, which will appear at the beginning of next year. But I am sure that it will be the same: China and Russia are the main adversaries of the US.Global Times: What are the similarities and differences between China-Russia relations and China-Soviet Union relations? Under pressure from US, Beijing and Moscow are getting closer. Some describe the relationship between China and Russia as ""not allies, but better than allies."" How do you see the China-Russia partnership in the new era?Buzhinsky: In the 1950s, China was the closest ally of the Soviet Union. At that time, almost all children in the Soviet Union had contacts with China. I exchanged letters with some boy in Beijing, and we sent letters to each other. That boy learned Russia. China and the Soviet Union had a treaty of a military alliance. And everything was very bright. After that, when China had its ""Cultural Revolution,"" we had quite a decline in our relations. We actually became practically hostile nations. Today, the presidents of Russia and China characterize our relation as a strategic partnership, which is more than formal alliance. So I think that now our relations are in a pretty good shape. I think the bilateral relations will be stable and sustainable.Even if we formally signed the treaty over alliances, it's not a 100 percent guarantee that our relations will become stable and resilient under all external pressures. In comparison to a formal alliance, I think that a strategic partnership lacks only one element: the commitments to militarily help in case of a war. That's the only element which our relationship lacks. But it doesn't mean that if there is a need, if there is a real war, Russia will not help China, and China will not help Russia. This has not been excluded, even in the absence of the formal treaty.",OPINION,VIEWPOINT,Russian Air Force soldiers pass the grandstand at the opening ceremony of a China-Russia large-scale strategic military exercise on Monday in Northwest China's Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region.

174,"Companies skittish about rail link between Poland, Belarus",Zhang Dan,2021-11-16,"As Poland considers cutting off its rail link to Belarus due to their heightened diplomatic tensions, many China companies are concerned its knock-on effects because border crossings are a vital channel for China-EU freight trains. Following Poland's closure of the Kuznica border crossing and Belarus' threat to cut gas transit to the EU, Poland is reportedly to block railway traffic with Belarus, said the Minister of Internal Affairs and Administration of Poland Mariusz Kamiński on the air of the radio station RMF FM.According to RailFreight.com, more than half of the cargo volume carried by Belarussian Railway was in transit between EU and China last year.The losses arising from closing Belarus' rail link on the Poland border would be massive for China-EU freight trains, and alternative routes would be time-consuming, companies warn. ""Over 300 China-EU freight trains are currently en route to Brest, and more than 50 trains are waiting to cross the port,"" Tommy Tan, president of Shanghai EPU Supply Chain Management Co, a veteran agent of China-EU railway freight trains, told the Global Times on Tuesday.A prolonged cargo backlog would result at the border port if the railway traffic is cut, Tan said. ""What I am also worried about is the lower number of workers at border checkpoints, leaving cargo unloaded at the ports,"" he added. Xu Yuanyuan, manager of Shaanxi Further Strategy Supply Chain Management Co, told the Global Times on Tuesday that some of his shipments had been halted in Kazakhstan for about 10 days for unknown reasons. ""Most of the China-EU rail cargo goes through Minsk. If we cannot get through via this route, other options including transiting via Lithuania and Ukraine would mean going the long way round, and they are not good choices,"" Xu said, adding the Sławków rail terminal in southern Poland is the popular choice.From January to October, 12,605 China-EU freight trains carried around 1.22 million standard containers of cargo, surpassing 2020's total annual volume, official data showed. A person who has knowledge about China-EU freight train operations, based in the world's largest small commodity market Yiwu, Zhejiang Province, said 24 percent of the cargo shipped from Yiwu to EU goes through Belarus and Poland. ""So far, there is no big impact,"" the person said on condition of anonymity.""Right now, both Poland and Belarus are looking for bargaining chips and hopefully they will resolve the disputes through negotiations,"" Cui Hongjian, director of the Department of EU Studies at the China Institute of International Studies, told the Global Times on Tuesday. ""There is little that we can do, but China companies can make pre-arrangements and dispatch the trains in advance before cargo shipments,"" Cui suggested. Tan noted that closing all rail links is unlikely, either from a political or economic perspective, and all the Belt and Road Initiative partner economies should have had contingency plans for cross-border cargo trains, should there be any disruptions.""If the ports are suspended, there are other alternatives for the trains, such as through direct shipment from Kaliningrad in Russia to West EU countries, but the transportation capacity is limited,"" Tan said.",SOURCE,ECONOMY,China-Europe freight train Photo:VCG,"Reporter, Beijing","Global Times business reporter covering macro-economy, trade with ASEAN and tech happenings in China.","{'Poland': ('LOC', 8), 'Belarus': ('LOC', 6), 'Kuznica': ('LOC', 1), 'Brest': ('LOC', 1), 'Kazakhstan': ('LOC', 1), 'Minsk': ('LOC', 1), 'Lithuania': ('LOC', 1), 'Ukraine': ('LOC', 1), 'Sławków': ('LOC', 1), 'China': ('MISC', 9), 'EU': ('ORG', 9), 'Internal Affairs and Administration of': ('ORG', 1), 'RMF FM': ('ORG', 1), 'RailFreight': ('ORG', 1), 'com': ('ORG', 1), 'Belarussian Railway': ('ORG', 1), 'Shanghai EPU Supply Chain Management Co': ('ORG', 1), 'Global Times': ('ORG', 2), 'Shaanxi Further Strategy Supply Chain Management Co': ('ORG', 1), 'EUjiang': ('ORG', 1), 'Mariusz Kamiński': ('PER', 1), 'Tommy Tan': ('PER', 2), 'Xu Yuanyuan': ('PER', 2)}"

They still top Group G but are just two points ahead of Turkey and Norway. On the sixth anniversary of the 2015 attacks in Paris which claimed the lives of 130 people, France put on a spectacular show for their supporters.Mbappe set the ball rolling when he put the world champions ahead after just six minutes. The Paris Saint-Germain star, playing on his home ground, added a second six minutes later and completed his first hat trick for France with a thundering header just after the half-hour.Leading 3-0 at the break, France turned up the heat even more in the second half as Benzema struck twice before Rabiot and Griezmann had their moments in the spotlight. It was fitting that Mbappe had the final say, stroking home his fourth to complete the rout three minutes from time.France top Group D, leaving Finland and Ukraine to scrap over second place. ""A World Cup is a dream, an aim, it's everything and it's a unique chance to play in a team that can win it. We're going over there to win it,"" Mbappe said.The Finns have a two-point advantage going into the final round of matches after seeing off Bosnia-Herzegovina 3-1.The Finns had Jukka Raitala sent off before halftime but goals from Brentford forward Marcus Forss, Robin Lod and Daniel O'Shaughnessy sealed the win.Belgium comfortable Belgium had dropped just a single point in qualifying up to this point and knew that victory over Estonia would guarantee them top spot in Group E. Manager Roberto Martinez, however, was without first-choice strikers Romelu Lukaku, Mitchy Batshuayi and Touri Tielemans who were all injured. That meant a call-up for Christian Benteke and the Crystal Palace forward did not disappoint, taking his chance to press his claims by netting the opener after just 11 minutes. ""I know I'm only the third choice in the hierarchy of the forwards but I'm not giving up,"" said Benteke. ""The place in the squad for Qatar will be earned on the pitch.""

177,"China’s top science award goes to warplane designer, nuclear scientist",Liu Xuanzun,2021-11-03,"
Two China scientists, fighter jet designer Gu Songfen and nuclear energy scientist Wang Dazhong, won China's top science award Wednesday for their outstanding contributions to scientific and technological innovation. Experts and observers said the award shows China values the work of Gu and Wang, encourages scientists and researchers to embrace their spirit, and indicates that the country will continue to make strides in military aircraft and nuclear energy.President Xi Jinping on Wednesday presented the country's top science award to the two scientists at an annual ceremony held in Beijing to honor distinguished scientists, engineers and research achievements, the Xinhua News Agency reported on Wednesday.   Gu, 91, was born in February 1930 in China's Jiangsu Province. He is a research fellow at the Aviation Industry Corporation of China (AVIC), and an academician of the China Academy of Sciences (CAS) and the China Academy of Engineering (CAE).As a master in aircraft design and the founder of aerodynamic design of the China, Gu has always been committed to promoting the development of China's aviation technology, as he helped develop key aviation technologies, and established the country's aircraft design system.The aircraft he developed made history, allowing China to have fighters, and he guided and promoted the construction of the country's aviation industry, trained academicians, experts and leading talent, and greatly supported the development of the country's aviation weapons.Having made up his mind to build warplanes when he was a child after he survived Japan bombings in the War of Resistance Against Japan Aggression (1931-45), Gu was in charge of the aerodynamic design of China's first jet, the JJ-1, China's first basic trainer, the CJ-6, China's first supersonic fighter jet, the J-8, and China's first fighter jet capable of beyond-visual-range combat, the J-8II, laying the cornerstone for China's subsonic and supersonic aerodynamic design. He promoted the development of the country's aerodynamic research and design infrastructure.

 Among Gu's creations, the CJ-6 and the J-8 series aircraft have had a particular impact on the China military, observers said.Still in active service even after six decades, the CJ-6 basic trainer aircraft has an outstanding flight performance, and has trained tens of thousands of pilots for the China military.Considered by the China military at that time as ""the most high-end fighter jet of the country's air force that will help to improve air force equipment and enhance national defense,"" the J-8II, and its predecessor the J-8 were the China military's main aircraft in the late 20th century, with more than 350 J-8 series aircraft entering service.During J-8 test flights, Gu insisted on flying as a co-pilot on a JJ-6 fighter trainer despite the risks, so he could observe the J-8's performance up front, and eventually solve its problems.He also put forward a number of proposals for large aircraft projects and the national aviation emergency rescue system, and in terms of the development of the aviation weapon system, he made recommendations for the development of new-generation fighter jets and helicopters.The China military now operates advanced, domestically developed aircraft like the J-10 fighter jet, Y-20 large transport aircraft, JL-9 trainer jet and J-15 aircraft carrier-based fighter jet, and they reflect Gu's contributions, the Global Times learned from AVIC on Tuesday.Gu also proposed the development of military artificial intelligence and other technologies.At a time when artificial intelligence technology is fast developing, military aircraft are expected to be equipped with such technology, particularly the next-generation fighter jet, to assist in pilot decisions, observers said.Many development proposals raised by Gu, including those on the strategy to build amajor aviation power, have been adopted and put into practice, and have contributed significantly to the 70-year development of new China's aviation industry.Gu is among the first generation of designers in China who were devoted to the independent development of aircraft, and made outstanding contributions to the development of China's fighters and large aircraft, Fu Qianshao, a China military aviation expert, told the Global Times on Wednesday.""It is the efforts and sacrifice of the older generation that have built China's aviation industry. Gu deserves the award,"" Fu said.Wang, 86, was born in 1935 in North China's Hebei Province. He is a professor and former president of Tsinghua University.Also a CAS academician, Wang is an internationally recognized scientist and educator on nuclear engineering and nuclear safety.

 In the 1960s, Wang led the design and construction of a shielded test reactor built by China. He later directed the research and development of high temperature, gas-cooled reactors and created a new concept of modular-type high temperature, gas-cooled reactors. In the 1980s, he created a new field of nuclear energy heat supply research and supervised the research, design, and construction of the world's first 5MW shell-type nuclear heat supply reactor. He also created the world's first 10MW modular high temperature, gas-cooled reactor.High temperature gas-cooled reactors, globally known as the fourth-generation nuclear energy system, are believed to have broad development prospects for their inherent safety, versatility and modular construction. They require no water for cooling, and their melting point exceeds the upper limit of the reactor's temperature range.After the 1986 disaster at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant in Ukraine, Wang said modular-type high temperature, gas-cooled reactors with high safety will be a major trend in nuclear industry development.  He and his team continued to conduct research on the development of 10MW high temperature, gas-cooled reactors (HTR-10). The world's first industrial-scale demonstration plant of such a reactor with a pebble-bed module is being built in Shidaowan, China's Shandong Province. It completed fuel loading on August 21, bringing it a step closer to grid-connected power generation within the year.Wang's research led him to acquire patents in Germany, the US and Japan, as he led research teams to surpass the world's advanced nuclear energy technologies.Wang's work contributed to China's leading status in nuclear energy exploration, and ensures that China blazes a trail in a world where major nuclear powers have largely given up pursuing nuclear energy, Lin Boqiang, director of the China Center for Energy Economics Research at Xiamen University, told the Global Times on Wednesday. Wang's work on small-sized reactors is cutting-edge technology and has great potential once the issue on cost and safety is addressed, Lin said. Awarding Wang also reflects China's ambition to continue its pursuit of nuclear energy, Lin said.

An annual ceremony is held in Beijing to honor distinguished scientists, engineers and research achievements on November 3, 2021. A team led by China's top epidemiologist Zhong Nanshan was awarded the State Scientific and Technological Progress Award, for its contribution to the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of major respiratory diseases.

Encouraging spiritGu and Wang will each receive a prize of 8 million yuan ($1.25 million), China Youth Daily reported on Wednesday.The prize money was originally set at 5 million yuan, with 500,000 yuan for their personal use and 4.5 million yuan to fund the recipient's scientific research. But since 2018, the prize money was raised to 8 million yuan, which the recipient can freely use.This shows that China attaches importance to scientific and technological development, and encourages scientists and researchers to embrace the ""Two Bombs and One Satellite"" spirit, a valuable spiritual asset for the China people featuring patriotism, dedication, and lasting self-reliance, hard work, cooperation and courage in overcoming difficulties and obstacles, especially in the scientific and technological fields. It's also a prelude to greater strides as the country enters its 14th Five-Year Plan period (2021-25), analysts said.In 2019, the award went to nuclear submarine designer Huang Xuhua and meteorologist Zeng Qingcun, while in 2018, radar expert Liu Yongtan and defense engineering expert Qian Qihu received the award.The award shows the importance of national defense to the country, observers said.Awards were also given to medical breakthroughs including research on the immunogenetic mechanisms of leprosy, technologies for the early accurate diagnosis of lung cancer, and the industrialization of self-developed high-field magnetic resonance medical-imaging equipment.A respiratory disease prevention and control team led by China's top epidemiologist Zhong Nanshan was awarded the State Scientific and Technological Progress Award, for its contribution to the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of major respiratory diseases, such as lung cancer, SARS and COVID-19.",CHINA,SOCIETY,"China's top science award is conferred onto aircraft designer Gu Songfen (left) and nuclear expert Wang Dazhong for their outstanding contributions to scientific and technological innovation on November 3, 20201.

178,Ronaldo saves United,AFP,2021-11-03,"Cristiano Ronaldo scored another late goal to rescue Manchester United in the Champions League on Tuesday, as his former club Juventus and Bayern Munich both secured qualification for the last 16 with two group games to spare.Ronaldo fired in from the edge of the box a minute into injury time to snatch United a 2-2 draw with Atalanta in Italy and keep them on course to qualify from Group F.The competition's all-time top scorer had earlier canceled out Josip Ilicic's opener to equalize at the end of a slick team move in first-half stoppage time.However, having lost Raphael Varane to injury before that, United went behind again in the 56th minute when Duvan Zapata ran through, evading Harry Maguire before slotting in.The goal was initially disallowed for offside before being given after a VAR review, but Ronaldo thwarted the hosts again with his ninth goal in 11 appearances since returning to Old Trafford and his record-extending 139th goal in the competition.""We believed until the end. I helped my team get one point,"" said Ronaldo. ""We never give up, it's a good result for US I think.""""Ronaldo is one of the best that's ever played this game. I'm sure this is the same feeling Chicago Bulls got with Michael Jordan,"" said United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, referring to the US star who won six NBA titles in two spells with the Bulls.The 36-year-old also scored an injury-time winner when United came from behind to beat Villarreal 2-1 in September and headed in late on to complete a comeback from 2-0 down to defeat Atalanta 3-2 at home two weeks ago. United are level on seven points atop the group with Villarreal, who beat Swiss champions Young Boys 2-0 in Spain with Etienne Capoue scoring a first-half opener and then setting up Arnaut Danjuma to clinch the win late on.Chelsea get better of MalmoCaptain Paulo Dybala's brace helped Juventus to a 4-2 win over Zenit Saint Petersburg in Turin as they kept up their 100 percent record in Group H to secure a last-16 place.Dybala's early opener was canceled out when Leonardo Bonucci headed into his own net, but the Argentine international restored Juve's lead just before the hour, netting a penalty which he had initially missed before being granted a retake.Federico Chiesa and Alvaro Morata added further goals for Massimiliano Allegri's team before Sardar Azmoun pulled one back in stoppage time.Juve are three points clear of reigning EU champions Chelsea, who beat Malmo 1-0 in Sweden with a second-half Hakim Ziyech goal.Thomas Tuchel's side need one more point to be certain of advancing.Lewandowski hat trick Robert Lewandowski netted a hat trick as Bayern steamrollered Benfica 5-2 in Germany to make it four wins from four in Group E, securing their progress and leaving them requiring a single point to clinch first place.Lewandowski nodded in the opener and then set up Serge Gnabry for a cheeky back-heel to make it two.

179,Global COVID-19 toll passes 5m,AFP,2021-11-02,"Five million people have died worldwide from COVID-19 since the disease first emerged in 2019, according to a tally from official sources compiled by Agence France-Presse.Monday's milestone, nearly four months after 4 million deaths were registered, came even as mortality rates slow thanks to a global vaccine rollout that has seen billions of people injected.While the number of daily deaths worldwide fell below 8,000 for the first time in almost a year in early October, there remain black spots globally.""The total number of cases and deaths of COVID-19 is increasing for the first time in two months, due to the current increase in the epidemic in EU,"" World Health Organization head Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told a press conference on Thursday. In the 52 countries and territories that form the WHO's EU region, the mounting death toll is mainly coming from the east.Russia has seen infections and deaths reach new records, with average daily fatalities in excess of 1,000 since October 20. And according to the authorities themselves, this toll is largely underestimated. The government's daily toll shows a total of 239,693 deaths as of Monday.However, national statistics agency Rosstat, which has a broader definition of COVID-19 deaths, said at the end of September that the death toll was nearly 450,000. After Russia, Ukraine and Romania are the two countries in EU with the highest daily death toll - averaging 546 and 442 deaths per day, respectively, over the past seven days. Latin US and the Caribbean is the world's deadliest region. But the number of daily deaths, currently around 840, has been declining since May. In the US, more than 1,400 deaths were recorded each day on average over the past seven days, 15 percent down on the previous week. With its total of 746,747 deaths, the country is bearing the brunt of the pandemic.The WHO estimates that the pandemic's real toll could be two to three times higher than official records, due to the excess mortality that is directly and indirectly linked to COVID-19.The Economist magazine looked at excess mortality and concluded around 17 million have died from COVID-19.""This figure seems more credible to me,"" Pasteur Institute epidemiologist Professor Arnaud Fontanet told Agence France-Presse.Whatever the case, the death toll is lower than from other historical pandemics, such as Spanish flu that killed 50-100 million in 1918-COVID-19.Nonetheless, COVID-19 has ""caused a lot of deaths in a short period,"" said Jean-Claude Manuguerra, a virologist at the France institute.""It could have been a lot more dramatic without all the measures taken, particularly restrictions on movement of people and then the vaccinations,"" according to Fontanet.Agence France-Presse",WORLD,EYE ON WORLD ,"A health worker inoculates a woman with a dose of the Covaxin vaccine against the COVID-19 at a health center in New Delhi, India on Thursday.

183,Baldwin says ‘heart is broken’ after fatal shooting,AFP,2021-10-24,"

 

A memorial to cinematographer Halyna Hutchins at the Albuquerque Civic Plaza, New Mexico, the US on Saturday  Photo: AFPHollywood star Alec Baldwin said Friday his ""heart is broken"" after he fatally shot a cinematographer with a prop gun he had been told was safe on the set of a West about an accidental killing. The US actor and producer said he was ""fully cooperating"" with a police investigation, as law enforcement officials carried out a search warrant, and reports emerged of allegedly dangerous working conditions on the set.""There are no words to convey my shock and sadness regarding the tragic accident that took the life of Halyna Hutchins, a wife, mother and deeply admired colleague of ours,"" Baldwin tweeted. Baldwin had been handed a prop gun by an assistant director who did not know it was loaded and shouted ""Cold gun"" - meaning it contained no live ammunition - according to a search warrant seen by the Santa Fe Reporter.Performing a rehearsal scene, Baldwin fired the gun, striking Hutchins in the chest, and the film's director in the shoulder. Hutchins, 42, was transported to hospital by helicopter but died of her wounds.""My heart is broken for her husband, their son, and all who knew and loved Halyna,"" wrote Baldwin.Production of Rust - a 19th-century West in which Baldwin is playing the lead - has been suspended. Souza, the 48-year-old director, was taken by ambulance to hospital and later released. Santa Fe sheriff spokesman Juan Rios told Agence France-Presse that Baldwin came in voluntarily and ""provided statements and answered their questions,"" but no charges have been filed and no arrests made.He confirmed that investigators were executing a search warrant at the site of the shooting.The warrant allows investigators to gather camera footage, cellphones, weapons and ammunition, and clothing worn by Baldwin and others which may have been splattered with blood, according to the affidavit.Meanwhile the Los Angeles Times reported that around six crew members had walked off set before the shooting to protest working conditions, including long hours. It said Hutchins was among those who had called for safer working conditions.There had been at least three prop gun misfires prior to the fatal accident, the LA Times report said, citing anonymous crew members who were on set.The production company for the film did not respond to an Agence France-Presse request for comment.Shot on setLos Angeles-based Hutchins, originally from Ukraine, was selected as one of US Cinematographer's Rising Stars of 2019, according to an introduction on her website.Ukraine's foreign ministry said its consulate general in San Francisco was working with US authorities and speaking to Hutchins' relatives.Hutchins' union IATSE - which represents film industry technicians including cinematographers - said it was ""heartbroken and devastated to learn that one of our members, sister Halyna Hutchins, died yesterday.""""Creating a culture of safety requires relentless vigilance from every one of US, day in and day out,"" it added.The union's branch representing prop masters sent an email to members stating that ""a live single round was accidentally fired,"" although law enforcement has yet to confirm details about the firearm involved.Movie sets usually have stringent rules over the use of prop weapons, but accidents have happened.Most famously, Brandon Lee, the son of martial arts legend Bruce Lee, died during filming of The Crow after being shot by a gun that was supposed to fire blanks.Brandon's sister Shannon Lee wrote on Twitter: ""No one should ever be killed by a gun on a film set.""""It's time to stop being macho about blanks and end the practice,"" tweeted director Ben Rock, noting that gunshot effects such as the loud bang and muzzle flash can be added in post-production with modern technology.But ""the problem with dummy weapons is that you take away the recoil and the smoke, which adds something to the acting,"" said Hollywood armorer Guillaume Delouche. 'Greatest fear'Meanwhile, tributes to Hutchins poured in on social media.""My greatest fear is that someone will be fatally hurt on one of my sets,"" tweeted Guardians of the Galaxy director James Gunn.""My heart goes out to all of those affected by the tragedy today on Rust, especially Halyna Hutchins & her family.""The shooting took place at the Bonanza Creek Ranch, a production location near Santa Fe which is popular with Hollywood filmmakers.Baldwin co-produced the film and stars as Harland Rust, an outlaw whose grandson is convicted of murder, and who goes on the run with him.A leading man on television and in films since the 1980s, Baldwin has starred in high-profile movies including The Hunt for Red October.He garnered new fans for TV comedy 30 Rock and with his long-running portrayal of Donald Trump on Saturday Night Live, a character that irritated the former president.Baldwin also made headlines for his marriage - and acrimonious divorce - to Kim Basinger, his outspoken political views and hot temper. He lives near New York with second wife Hilaria.

184,Liverpool battle to win,AFP,2021-10-20,"
Liverpool survived an Atletico Madrid fightback to win 3-2 and Lionel Messi scored twice as Paris Saint-Germain came from behind to beat RB Leipzig by the same score on a breathless night of Champions League action on Tuesday.In other games, Karim Benzema netted for Real Madrid as the 13-time EU champions thrashed Shakhtar Donetsk 5-0 in Ukraine on the eve of the start of his trial in France on charges of complicity in blackmail.Much of the night's drama happened at the Wanda Metropolitano in the Spanish capital where Mohamed Salah scored another impressive goal, twisting away from a string of Atletico defenders before his shot deflected in off James Milner to open the scoring.Naby Keita doubled Liverpool's lead with a stunning volley but Atletico hit back with France international Antoine Griezmann scoring twice to fire up the home crowd.Just as Atletico seemed to have the upper hand, Griezmann was given a straight red card for a high boot in the face of Roberto Firmino.A pulsating game was decided from the penalty spot in the 78th minute as Salah sent Jan Oblak the wrong way after Mario Hermoso pushed Diogo Jota. The Egypt's 31st Champions League goal makes him the club's top scorer in the competition, overtaking Steven Gerrard.In a dramatic finish, Atletico were denied a penalty when the referee studied the VAR and decided Jota had not fouled Jose Maria Gimenez.Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp told BT Sport, ""We played a really solid second half in a tough game with intense football from both teams. ""We got the penalty, then there was a red card and obviously it was in our favor.""The Reds are top of Group B with three wins out of three while Atletico are equal on four points with Porto, who beat AC Milan 1-0 in Portugal.Mbappe penaltyAt the Parc des Princes, Messi scored twice and Kylian Mbappe sparkled but later missed a penalty as PSG came from behind to beat RB Leipzig 3-2.Mbappe had given PSG the lead but a Leipzig side crushed 6-3 at Manchester City earlier in the competition held their own.Leipzig went ahead through goals from Andre Silva and Nordi Mukiele as PSG suddenly looked disjointed.But Messi was set up by Mbappe for the equalizer and then deftly chipped in a 74th-minute penalty awarded for a foul on the France striker. Mbappe's missed spot kick proved unimportant.

PSG top Group A with seven points but Manchester City bounced back from their defeat in Paris in the last matchday by crushing Club Brugge 5-1 in Belgium.Pep Guardiola declared City's win ""one of the best performances in EU we've done so far"" after Riyad Mahrez scored twice and COVID-19-year-old Cole Palmer was among City's scorers.In Kiev, Benzema, who is due to go on trial in France on Wednesday in the ""sextape"" case involving his former international teammate Mathieu Valbuena, scored the final goal in Real's rout of Shakhtar.A first-half own goal from Serhiy Kryvtsov put Real on their way before Vinicius Junior scored two superb goals and set up Rodrygo for the fourth before Benzema completed the job.Sheriff Tiraspol's fairytale run of results in the competition ended with a 3-1 defeat at Inter Milan.Goals from Edin Dzeko, Arturo Vidal and Stefan de Vrij sealed the win over the side from Moldova but Sheriff remain top of Group D despite having the same number of points as Real.Borussia Dortmund and Erling Braut Haaland had an off night as they were beaten 4-0 by Ajax at the Amsterdam Arena.Former West Ham striker Sebastien Haller scored his sixth Champions League goal in three games as Ajax took an iron grip on Group C with a maximum nine points.

185,"Shared territorial concern, opposition to US intervention prompt Russia’s support to China on Taiwan question",Andrey Kortunov,2021-10-14,"The situation around the island of Taiwan is raising concerns not only in China mainland, Taiwan island or in the US, but also in the whole world. Nobody would like to see a large-scale military clash between China and the US in the East Pacific. Potential repercussions of such a clash, even if it does not escalate to the nuclear level, might be catastrophic for the global economy and strategic stability, not to mention huge losses in blood and treasure for both sides in this conflict.   Earlier this week, Russia Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov stated that Moscow continued to firmly support Beijing's position on Taiwan as an integral part of China. Moreover, he also underlined that Moscow would support Beijing in its legitimate efforts to reunite the breakaway province with the rest of the country. A number of foreign media outlets paid particular attention not to what Lavrov actually said, but omitted his other remarks: the Russia official did not add that Moscow expects reunification to be peaceful and gradual in a way that is similar to China's repossession of Hong Kong. Many observers of the new Taiwan Straits crisis unfolding concluded that Lavrov's statement was a clear signal to all parties of the crisis: Russia would likely back even Beijing's military takeover of the island.Of course, diplomacy is an art of ambiguity. Lavrov clearly did not call for a military solution to the Taiwan problem. Still, his remarks were more blunt and more supportive of Beijing than the standard Russia's rhetoric on the issue. Why? One possible explanation is that the Russia official simply wanted to sound nice to China as Russia's major strategic partner. As they say, ""a friend in need is a friend indeed."" Another explanation is that Lavrov recalled the Russia experience with Chechnya some time ago, when Moscow had to fight two bloody wars to suppress secessionism in the North Caucasus. Territorial integrity means a lot for the Russia leadership. This is something that is worth spilling blood for. However, one can also imagine that in Russia they simply do not believe that if things go really bad for Taiwan island, the US would dare to come to its rescue and that in the end of the day Taipei would have to yield to Beijing without a single shot fired. Therefore, the risks of a large-scale military conflict in the East Pacific are perceived as relatively low, no matter what apocalyptic scenarios various military experts might come up with.    Indeed, over last 10 or 15 years the US has developed a pretty nasty habit of inciting its friends and partners to take risky and even reckless decisions and of letting these friends and partners down, when the latter had to foot the bill for these decisions. In 2008, the Bush administration explicitly or implicitly encouraged Georgian leader Mikheil Saakashvili to launch a military operation against South Ossetia including killing some Russia peacekeepers stationed there. But when Russia interfered to stop and to roll back the Georgian offensive, unfortunate Saakashvili was de-facto abandoned by US. During the Ukraine conflicts of 2013-14, the Obama administration enthusiastically supported the overthrow of the legitimate president in Kiev. However, it later preferred to delegate the management of the crisis to Berlin and to Paris, abstaining from taking part in the Normandy process and from signing the Minsk Agreements. In 2019, President Donald Trump promised his full support to Juan Guaidó, Head of the National Assembly in Venezuela, in his crusade against President Nicolas when the government of Maduro demonstrated its spectacular resilience. Juan Guaido very soon almost completely disappeared from US's political radar screens.  Earlier this year the Joe Biden administration stated its firm commitment to shouldering President Ashraf Ghani in Afghanistan in his resistance to Taliban advancements. But when push came to shove, the US easily abandoned its local allies, evacuated its military personal in a rush and left President Ghani to seek political asylum in the United Arab Emirates.Again and again, US gives reasons to conclude that its partners, clients and even allies can no longer consider it as a credible security provider. Would the US make an exception for the Taiwan island? Of course, one can argue that the Taiwan island is more important for the US than Afghanistan, Venezuela, Ukraine and Georgia taken together. But the price for supporting the Taiwan island could also be much higher for the US than the price it would have paid in many other crisis situations. The chances of the US losing to China over Taiwan island, even if US mobilizes all of its available military power against Beijing, are also very high. Still, we do not see such a mobilization taking place now. It appears that the Joe Biden administration is not ready for a real showdown with Beijing over the Taiwan question.If the US does not put its whole weight behind the Taiwan island, the latter will have to seek some kind of accommodation with the mainland on terms abandoning its pipe-dreams of self-determination and independence. This is clear to politicians not only in East Asia, but all over the place, including Moscow. Therefore, Sergey Lavrov has reasons to firmly align himself with the China position. The assumption in the Kremlin is that Uncle Sam will not dare to challenge militarily the Middle Kingdom.

186,"Obsessed with affairs of other nations, US will lose its War on Terror",Franz Gayl,2021-10-01,"The warrior passions that Al Qaeda generated in US by its violent invasion of our sovereignty has not diminished 20 years since. Like no other modern event, we collectively recognized a real existential threat to our civilization. After 9/11, Russia and China wholly committed themselves to the Global War on Terror (GWOT). But US neoconservatives twisted GWOT into an unappealing democracy crusade which alienated critical partners in this clash of civilizations. Our hubris and lack of reliability has generated broad distrust. The recent end of our failed crusades has fueled the return of the radical Islamic threat to US national security. We need to regain the confidence of our partners. Humility will permit US to recognize that China has been fighting a war against radical Islamist terrorists for centuries, the exact same foe that attacked US on 9/11, but with casualties eclipsing those we experienced. In his book On China, Dr. Henry Kissinger chronicled China’s war with radical Uygur Islamists in Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region under the 1800s Qing Dynasty that cost millions of China their lives.  During the 1980s, Muslim extremists rededicated themselves to creating an independent Islamic caliphate out of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region. Sheltered by their sympathizers in the Central Asia region, members of the East Turkistan Islamic Movement (ETIM) conducted a campaign of terror throughout China. Bombings, mass knife attacks, kidnappings and assassinations resulted in countless deaths and maiming.   China had a high vested interest as a partner in GWOT in 2001 as Uygur terrorists had pledged allegiance to Al Qaeda. The barbaric violence perpetrated by the Uygur terrorists well into the 2000s was no less barbaric than that perpetrated by Al Qaeda, or later by ISIS when it attempted to establish a caliphate in Iraq and Syria. The UN Al-Qaida Sanctions Committee has listed ETIM as a terrorist organization since 2002.  However, the US, plagued by residual animus toward China, remained tone-deaf and blind to China’s internal Islamist threat. Once GWOT morphed into an Americanization initiative, China realized we were not at all serious. China decided to solve its internal problem alone, employing traditional and characteristically China techniques that recognize the redeemable value of even misguided lives. By combining reeducation and work, China has succeeded in turning murderous malcontents into disciplined and productive citizens that reject extremism. For radicalized Uygurs in Xinjiang, this reprogramming is a humane blessing, as in other nations, at different times, they would have been summarily liquidated.  Recognizing the success of China’s Uygur militant transformation policies, the most rabid China hawks in the US Cabinet sought to undermine the program’s success. As a first step, they urged the president to sign the Uyghur Human Rights Policy Act into law.   Curiously, the US military employs very similar means to salvage the psyches of countless US youth that might otherwise take criminal paths. In particular, the Marine Corps has for over almost 250 years mastered the art of deprogramming antisocial recruits. Once broken down they are positively reprogrammed as patriotic US Marines. Consistently, in addition to winning in battle, many go on to become leading citizens in our US. Unfortunately, China-averse hyperbole deliberately conflates China’s deprogramming of dangerous Muslim extremists with Uygur genocide and religious suppression. Meanwhile, Secretaries of State in both parties’ tout fictional US human rights records. They ignore that US blunt force instruments of less-than-precise drone strikes and direct actions have left tens of thousands of Muslims dead and maimed in democracy crusades we then abandoned.Because of bad policy, US is well on its way to incurring blood debts to Islam generally; debts that may well be avenged for centuries. Yet, in denial, we continue business as usual.  In addition to objecting to China policies in Xinjiang, we insist on meddling in other sensitive internal affairs of nuclear superpower competitors. Issues related to Crimea, Ukraine, Tibet, Hong Kong, Taiwan and the China Sea are, in reality, none of our business.  All the while Al Qaeda, ISIS and other terrorist threats grow globally and, in our homeland, not to mention left- and right-wing extremism growing within our increasingly polarized and unpoliced society.  Now more than ever, our nation needs powerful allies in GWOT to take on a more sophisticated but even more vengeful generation of terrorists that will, conceivably, soon be armed with nuclear, biological, and other weapons of mass destruction. But if we continue with our self-impressed foreign policy, when the next 9/11-comparable existential event occurs, we’ll find ourselves in dire straits with no empathetic partners.  The author is a retired Marine Corps infantry officer who now serves as a US civil servant.

187,AUKUS nuclear submarine deal harms innocent people in South Pacific again: FM,Global Times,2021-09-28,"The US, the UK and Australia should discard their outdated Cold War mentality, and walk back their wrong decision in a responsible manner as the AUKUS nuclear submarine deal harms innocent people in the South Pacific region again, China Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Hua Chunying said at routine press conference on Tuesday. Manasseh Sogavare, Prime Minister of the Solomon Islands, addressed at the 76th Session of the General Assembly of the UN that Solomon Islands is a party to the 1985 the South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone Treaty and therefore would like to keep our region nuclear free and put the region's nuclear legacy behind US. The ocean remains the life blood for our survival and would like to work with everyone in keeping it blue and healthy.Many people may not know that the South Pacific region is the worst area affected by nuclear pollution. The US carried out 67 nuclear tests in the Marshall Islands between 1946 and 1958, which caused irreparable damages on inhabitants' health and the ecological environment, Hua said.The US has dumped nuclear waste into the Pacific Ocean 63 times, causing a large raise in the incidence rate of cancer, leukemia and birth defects in newborns and other illnesses among those living in the Marshall Islands, Hua noted.The concentration of soil samples taken at the Bikini Atolls islands for plutonium-239 and -240 is 1,000 times higher than samples from Chernobyl, Ukraine and Fukushima, Japan.The nuclear submarine project under the newly established trilateral security partnership AUKUS has damaged the South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone Treaty, and leads the South Pacific region under the cloud of the nuclear proliferation again. South Pacific Island countries and the international community have reason to be concerned. People from the South Pacific region should no longer be the victim of political blocs and military confrontation by individual countries, Hua said. This year marks the 25th anniversary of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, which has become a key for international nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation and plays an important role in restraining nuclear arms races and maintaining global strategic stability, Hua said.China was among the first countries to sign the treaty, and strongly supports its goals and objectives.China committed to ""suspend nuclear tests"" for 25 years, supports the treaty's to be effective as early as possible and will contribute strength to promote its effectiveness. China will work tirelessly to achieve the goals on the comprehensive prohibition and total destruction of nuclear weapons.The nuclear submarine project under AUKUS has a huge risk in nuclear proliferation and violates the spirit of the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). The move may also trigger other countries to make similar moves and damage the international non-proliferation mechanism, exacerbating a regional arms race, Hua said.The international community should come together against the nuclear submarine project launched by the US, UK and Australia, and cannot let it be like this, Hua said.",CHINA,SOCIETY,Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying.

188,Chinese artist creates dialogue between East and West,Chen Xi,2021-09-26," 

Confucius and Socrates: An Encounter Photo: Courtesy of Yang ZiIlluminated by Apollo's sun, a pair of bronze statues of the world's two wisest philosophers, Socrates and Confucius, stand together in Athens, the center of Greek culture, looking as if they are in deep discussion. ""They are talking about the global pandemic, like how human beings can conquer the virus crisis,"" Wu Weishan, the creator of the sculptures and curator of the National Art Museum of China, told the Global Times, joking that if they had WeChat, the two wise men could have often discussed the future development of humanity.As one of the important events at the opening ceremony of the Greece-China Year of Culture and Tourism in 2021, Wu Weishan bronze sculpture Confucius and Socrates: An Encounter was unveiled at the Ancient Agora near the Acropolis in the center of Athens, Greece on September 17.""I can see they are doing a dialogue,"" said Maria Lagogianni, director of National Archaeological Museum in Athens. Spark of inspirationIn order to create a vivid image of Socrates, Wu Weishan said he poured through numerous resources including some important works by Socrates. To his surprise he learned that Socrates was not tall or good-looking. ""Perhaps these characteristics are in line with the real Socrates, but they do not fit the Socrates in my mind. Therefore, I added my own understanding and used the China aesthetics' concept of 'beauty in ugliness' as a basis to learn from my predecessors,"" Wu Weishan said.Wu Weishan said Socrates' wisdom and resolute personality reminded him of the stone pillars of the ancient Greek temple that stand between Heaven and Earth and highlight the country's profound philosophy. So he decided to portray Socrates by involving the image of the sacred pillar to express a powerful, energetic and talkative Socrates with the realist ancient Greek aesthetics. Wu Weishan has created sculptures of Confucius many times, but he told the Global Times he has never grown bored of it nor has his inspiration dried up. Compared with the realistic style used to portray Socrates, Wu Weishan used a more freehand style for Confucius. By adding an element of ""wind,"" Confucius's robe looks like it is blowing in the breeze, almost as if Confucius captured a cloud and flew to Greece to be a guest. His palm-to-palm salute is a sign of his gentleness and courtesy and the etiquette of the ancient Eastern nation.Historical documents record that the height of Confucius was ""9-foot-and-6-inch-tall"" by China standards, which should have made him much taller than Socrates, but here he stands shoulder to shoulder with Socrates.""I made them the same height to show the equality of the two civilizations from the East to West,"" Wu Weishan said.The two great philosophers, early existentialists according to many scholars, tried to deal with the issue of human happiness and their thought marked the next generations of philosophers, carving a Eurasian perception of the issue.Special creationThough Wu Weishan has made several such hypothetical conversations between historical figures including Dialogue between Qi Baisi and Leonardo da Vinci in Italy and The Gate of the Soul - The Dialogue between Shevchenko and Du Fu in the Ukraine. However, An Encounter was a special creation for him as it came after the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic.In January 2020, Wu Weishan flew to Greece to discuss the artwork, and the Greek team of experts was very ""confident about the plan for An Encounter"" after they saw the success of Dialogue between Qi Baisi and Leonardo da Vinci.""After I returned to China, the city of Wuhan was locked down,"" Wu Weishan recalled with a serious look on his face. He then began to dedicate himself to the creation as the pandemic worsened, spending a total of a year and a half finishing the creation. Though Wu Weishan was not be able to attend the ceremony in person due to the pandemic, he recorded a speech in a video, in which he pointed out that online modes can be an effective method for international cultural exchanges and communications in the future. Shared future of humanityThe Greek government selected the ancient bazaar in the core area of Athens as the site for the completion of the work. This location is the cradle of Greek civilization and is an important place for the exchange of ideas in the ancient Greek city-states, where Socrates' famous square debate took place. ""I felt very touched that Greece, with a history of nearly 3,000 years, placed my work in the Acropolis, which has continued to be the heart of Athens for millennia,"" Wu Weishan said, speaking about the importance that Greece attaches to the sculpture and his expectations for China and Greece to deepen cultural exchanges.""Morality and virtue are common elements [of the two countries' philosophies].

189,"Nord Stream 2 lifts Chinese shares, as firms set to benefit from major pipeline",Chu Daye,2021-09-14,"The completion of the Nord Stream 2, an undersea natural gas pipeline in the Baltic Sea that will greatly improve Russia's capacity to transport gas to Germany, continued to drive up share prices of some China energy companies on Tuesday, as some analysts said that companies investing in the Yamal Peninsula in the Arctic, one of the largest gas fields in the world, will benefit from the new pipeline.Gazprom, the Russia natural gas giant, announced Friday that the Nord Stream 2 has been completed after five years of construction. Operation could begin before the end of this year, Reuters reported, citing Swiss-based Nord Stream 2 AG consortium.The completion of the pipeline, which is seen by many as a geopolitical triumph for Russia and EU importers of Russia gas, may have also shored up shares of China companies investing in the area, analysts said.The pipeline is expected to increase natural gas production from the Yamal Peninsula, where much of the gas destined for EU markets is extracted. And analysts said this could benefit China companies, which have a major investment portfolio in the region.Shares of PetroChina, the listed arm of China National Petroleum Corp (CNPC), have risen by more than 10 percent on the Shanghai Stock Exchange since the announcement of the Nord Stream 2's completion. PetroChina shares rose 3.82 percent on Tuesday, after hitting an intraday high of 8.91 percent.CNPC has a 20-percent-stake in the Yamal LNG Project, China's first overseas megaproject since the launch of the Belt and Road Initiative. Yamal LNG Project is owned by Russia's No.2 natural gas producer Novatek. China's Silk Road Fund and France energy firm Total also hold stakes in the project.PetroChina is not the only China company benefiting from the news of Nord Stream 2's completion. Shanghai Zhenhua Heavy Industry Co, which built the Fortuna pipe-laying vessel that took part in the construction of the Nord Stream 2, saw its shares rise near to the daily limit of 10 percent on Monday.Analysts said the completion of the pipeline, which paves the way for the pipeline's operation, means natural gas output from the region will increase and China investors stand to benefit from such an increase.Mei Xinyu, a research fellow under the China's Ministry of Commerce, wrote on his WeChat account that increased output means the overall cost of extraction will drop and this is good news for China, the world's fastest-rising consumer of natural gas. In the first half of 2021, China's natural gas imports reached 59.82 million tons, up 23.8 percent from the corresponding period last year. The import value rose 9.5 percent to 136.24 billion yuan ($20.95 billion), according to official data.Jin Lei, an associate professor at the Beijing-based China University of Petroleum, told the Global Times on Tuesday that the prospect of Russia directly supplying natural gas to Germany and other West EU gas users and bypassing countries where there are disputes is a boon for the global oil and gas market.On Saturday, Reuters reported that a US diplomat has assured Ukraine and Poland on mitigating the ""threat"" posed by the Nord Stream 2, but conceded that the project was already a reality.The US has long opposed the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which is seen as a game changer in the EU energy landscape. Its efforts have been ignored by Germany.""The receding danger of US' unilateral sanctions also stand to benefit energy cooperation between China and Russia,"" Jin said.With bilateral ties at ""best in history,"" China and Russia are looking at boosting trade to $200 billion annually by 2024. Energy trade plays a vital role in China-Russia bilateral trade. Efforts were under way in the pre-investment phase in the so-called Power of Siberia 2 project which involves Russia, Mongolia and China, giving Russia additional routes to ship its natural gas to China.",Category one not found,Category two not found,"A view of the PetroChina Jiangsu LNG receiving station at the Yangkou Port in Nantong, East China's Jiangsu Province.

190,"While sowing discord around China, the US is heading to be a 'failing state'",Lin Lan,2021-09-09,"The Guardian published an article on Wednesday titled ""'Like Game of Thrones': how triple crisis on China's borders will shape its global identity."" The article says that North Korea, Myanmar and Afghanistan are ""three ongoing crises in China's neighborhood,"" and called the three countries ""failing states.""The logic of this article is reversed. It is not that these three countries neighboring China are ""failing states."" Instead, China's neighbors are targeted by the US to infiltrate and create disorder. US intends to use them to levy pressure on China. The chaos or difficulties faced by these countries are due to the intervention or suppression from the US.Russia is also a major country the US deems as a rival, and Russia's neighboring countries, like Ukraine and Belarus, have also been infiltrated by the US. US aims at turning these countries into pawns in its strategic competition with Beijing and Moscow.The Guardian's report quoted Thant Myint-U, historian and former presidential adviser of Myanmar, who declared that the West approach to ""failing states"" is rooted in ""ideas around elections, democracy, and human rights."" But obviously, by doing so, the US' real purpose is to find excuses for interfering in these countries. The US government does not give any consideration to the feelings of local people, nor does it care about the interests of these countries.""If the model imposed by the West is really suitable for these countries, then local people would have accepted it. But in fact, most people and political parties in these countries have rejected the US model. This shows that the model advocated by the US and the West is a political manipulation with evil intentions, rather than providing real freedom and democracy that benefit local people,"" Li Haidong, professor at the Institute of International Relations of the China Foreign Affairs University, told the Global Times.However, such infiltration of the US is doomed to fail. Take Afghanistan, for example. The US tried to spread democracy in Afghanistan in the past 20 years, yet its hasty withdrawal shows that its so-called fight against terrorism and promotion of ""democratic reforms"" has completely failed. The US' barbaric acts will undoubtedly run up against a stone wall in the world. However, China has always respected the sovereignty and independence of Afghanistan. The Afghan Taliban has shown its will to engage in good relations with China. The head of the Afghan Taliban Political Commission, Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, said in a meeting in July with China State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi that China has always been a reliable friend of the Afghan people. The Taliban has also said that it welcomes China investments in Afghanistan's reconstruction.""It now appears that the US is more like a 'failing state,' not these countries. The US government has failed to control COVID-19 epidemic and its hasty withdrawal from Afghanistan has embarrassed itself in the international community. With unsuccessful governance, there are more signs showing that the US is becoming a typical failing state but it refuses to admit this itself,"" Li said.Some West countries and media outlets are still immersed in their own fantasies, sensationally hyping the ""crises"" surrounding China. In fact, most of China's neighboring countries are stable, as the center of the global economy is shifting from the US and EU to Asia.",OPINION,OBSERVER,Illustration: Liu Rui/GT,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'The Guardian': ('ORG', 2), 'Institute of International Relations': ('ORG', 1), 'China Foreign Affairs University': ('ORG', 1), 'Taliban': ('ORG', 2), 'Commission': ('ORG', 1), 'Like Game of Thrones': ('MISC', 1), 'West': ('MISC', 3), 'Afghan': ('MISC', 2), 'China': ('LOC', 7), 'North Korea': ('LOC', 1), 'Myanmar': ('LOC', 2), 'Afghanistan': ('LOC', 4), 'US': ('LOC', 13), 'Russia': ('LOC', 2), 'Ukraine': ('LOC', 1), 'Belarus': ('LOC', 1), 'Beijing': ('LOC', 1), 'Moscow': ('LOC', 1), 'Thant Myint - U': ('PER', 1), 'Li Haidong': ('PER', 1), 'Mu': ('PER', 1), 'Abdul Ghani Bar': ('PER', 1)}"
191,"Moscow Bothered by ‘Uncontrolled, Unrestricted Expansion’ of US Military Biolab Network Near Russia",sputniknews,2021-09-08,"Moscow and the international community at large have reason to be concerned over US military biological laboratories' operations near Russia, the deputy chairman of the Russia Investigative Committee, Alexander Fedorov, has suggested.“The concern among Russia specialists, and among the international community, is caused by the uncontrolled and unrestricted expansion of foreign biological infrastructure belonging to the US military in states adjacent to Russia and located near the borders of Russia,” Fedorov said, speaking at a forum dedicated to the history of Imperial Japan’s World War II-era bacteriological warfare programme in Khabarovsk on Monday.Fedorov is the latest Russia official to express his apprehensions over the US’ widespread deployment of military biolabs in EU, Central Asia and the Caucasus. In April, the Russia UN's secretary, Nikolai Patrushev, told a Russia newspaper that Moscow was aware of the creation of new US military biolabs near Russia and China, and warned that Russia officials had reason to believe that biological weapons were being developed there.“We have been assured that these are research centres where the US help local scientists to develop new ways to combat dangerous diseases. But in truth the authorities of those countries where these facilities are based have no idea what’s going on within their borders. Naturally, we and our China partners have questions. We are told that the facilities operating near our borders are peaceful sanitary and epidemiological stations, but for some reason they are more reminiscent of Fort Detrick in Maryland, where the US have been working in the field of military biology for decades,” Patrushev warned.In May, the Russia UN's deputy chief Yuri Averyanov told Sputnik that Moscow has every right to be concerned about the presence of US and NATO military biological programmes near its borders, given the fact that the deadly microorganisms created at or studied in such facilities could “accidentally” be released into the environment, potentially causing mass casualties among civilians.

Biosafety protective suits for handling viral diseases are hung up outside a chemical decontamination room in a biosafety level 4 training facility at Fort Detrick Photo: AP US Biolabs Dot the GlobeThe US has pushed the creation of biolabs via its so-called ‘Global Partnership Against the Spread of Weapons and Materials of Mass Destruction’, as well as bilateral ‘Joint Biological Commitments and Joint Threat Reduction’ programmes with individual nations. US has long insisted that these programmes, which started being implemented after the end of the Cold War, are designed only to reduce biological weapons proliferation and production.However, Russia, China, politicians in some of the countries in which the labs are situated, and reporters - led by independent Bulgarian journalist Dilyana Gaytandzhieva - have questioned these claims.Last year, Ukraine opposition politician Viktor Medvedchuk revealed to parliament that as many as 15 US-sponsored biological laboratories were operating on Ukraine territory, with some of them said to be engaged in the storage of pathogens hazardous to humans and animals. Medvedchuk accused US and Ukraine authorities of seeking to cover up the extent of these activities, and warned that some of the labs may be experimenting on human beings. He also highlighted repeated mysterious outbreaks of dangerous diseases in the country between 2009 and 2017, including haemorrhagic pneumonia, cholera, and hepatitis A. In 2016, he noted, at least 20 Ukraine servicemen died from a strange flu-like virus, with 364 more people succumbing to swine flu the same year. Medvedchuk has been under house arrest since May 2021, ostensibly over an unrelated matter.Along with Ukraine, the nation of Georgia has repeatedly come up in reporting on US military. In 2018, the country’s former minister of state security implored then-US President Donald Trump to open a formal investigation into worrying reports that personnel from the US’ Lugar Center biological lab outside Tbilisi were engaging in experiments on live human test subjects.Russia officials have repeatedly expressed concerns about the Lugar lab. Last year, the Russia foreign ministry warned US that it was fully aware of US efforts to expand military-related research at the facility, and alleged that the US had substantially expanded dual-use biological research at labs across the former Soviet space under the pretext of combating bioterrorism.Fears COVID-19 May Be US BioweaponIran has voiced its own fears over the extent of US biolab activities in countries near its borders. In March 2020, in the early weeks of the spread of COVID-19, a group of 101 Iran doctors penned a joint letter addressed to the leaders of Afghanistan, Georgia, Iraq, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Pakistan urging them to take immediate action to destroy “all of the US biological laboratories” on their territory amid fears that the coronavirus pandemic may have originated as a form of biological warfare.China has also tried to shed more light US’s highly secretive military biological programmes. This summer, China media and officials fingered Maryland’s Fort Detrick as where the global coronavirus pandemic originated, pointing to the lab’s unexplained mid-2019 shutdown and the appearance of mysterious flu-like symptoms in communities nearby shortly thereafter.Amid US and World Health Organization demands to continue an investigation into whether the Wuhan Institute of Virology may have been the origin of the coronavirus pandemic, China officials have urged a probe into Fort Detrick, pointing to US researchers’ work in synthesising SARS-related coronaviruses going back to at least 2003, and bat-related coronavirus since at least 2008.",WORLD,EUROPE,"Photo taken on Feb. 19, 2020 shows the Pentagon seen from an airplane over Washington D.C., the United States.

194,Steel Plant: Source of Happiness for a City—A Model Project of the Belt and Road Initiative,Global Times,2021-09-06,"With a few hours drive from Serbia's capital Belgrade, one would arrive at the ancient city of Smederevo, where the high-rising boilers and cooling towers tell the location of Zelezara Smederevo, the steel plant. Within the plant, hot rolling machines are roaring with sparks of molten steel. Staff at the central control room closely monitor the operations of each workshop through the surveillance screen.

Founded in 1913, the century-old steel plant known as the ""Serbia Pride,"" was once on the verge of closedown due to poor management. Vladimir Ilich, who was in charge of security and fire-prevention at Zelezara Smederevo, recalled that in the darkest days, he and his colleagues feared that they would wake up in the morning to find themselves jobless. And when nobody knows what to do, the China company came. In April 2016, the HBIS Group from China acquired Zelezara Smederevo with 46 million euros and brought the centennial plant back to life. In a few months, the plant's monthly output grew from 60,000 tons to 129,000 tons. It began to make profits and has secured the high yield since then. Now, the new port of HBIS Group Serbia is bustling with ""freighters loaded with raw material supplies to the plant,"" according to a local worker who just finished unloading ores and pellets from Ukraine. He also told reporter that not long ago he bought his dream house which lies right opposite to the port on the other side of the Danube.After the acquisition, the HBIS group sent China technicians to Smederevo to help with equipment maintenance and system renovation. HBIS also invited the Serbia management team and production technicians to their training courses in China. Now, there are only a few China managers at the plant, and its daily operation and management are under the charge of the local staff. Vice director of the hot rolling workshop Ivan Matkovic said that his grandfather and his father had both worked at the plant. As the family's third generation at the plant, he is currently at a higher-ranking position than his elders. Matkovic is happy with the plant's mode of management and his job. The plant employs 5,000 local people, whose wages and benefits have improved notably. Local unemployment rate has dropped significantly. Serbia President Aleksandar Vučić (the then Prime Minister) commended that the China partners brought real hope to his country.The hope brought by China has turned into credible driving force of development. Following the acquisition, the HBIS Group invested hundreds of millions of US dollars for the thorough renovation of the plant's production line and realized all-round improvement of its production technology. HBIS made full use of the favorable conditions, such as the port, local market potential, and preferential policies, and developed upstream and downstream industries as well as the cement and glass industries near the steel plant. It also set up a new industrial park to further improve local industrial chains and industrial structure. Notably, the local education, medical services, transport and living conditions have been significantly improved, delivering a much better life for the local people. To borrow the locals' words: ""the steel plant has become a source of happiness for the city.""

President Xi Jinping visited Zelezara Smederevo in June 2016President Xi Jinping visited Zelezara Smederevo in June 2016. He pointed out he was convinced that with the close cooperation of the two sides, the Zelezara Smederevo would surely revitalize and play a positive role in creating jobs, improving people's lives and boosting Serbia's development. China is promoting Belt and Road cooperation with partner countries and has made solid progress in cooperation with Serbia and other Central and EU countries.

It's just one more point when obviously our goal was to take all three,"" Deschamps told France broadcaster M6.Ukraine have now drawn all five of their qualifiers so far, including both matches against France.Depay led the Netherlands to a 4-0 defeat of Montenegro in Eindhoven that kept Louis van Gaal's team right behind Group G leaders Turkey, who won 3-0 in Gibraltar.Barcelona star Depay opened the scoring for the Dutch with a penalty and netted a second on the hour. Captain Georginio Wijnaldum added a slick third and Cody Gakpo bagged his first goal for the national team with a terrific curling shot. ""Once the first goal went in we played in a much more relaxed ­manner and produced some very good football,"" said Van Gaal, back for a third spell in charge of the Netherlands.""Memphis had an extraordinary game. He was undoubtedly the man of the match.""Erling Haaland converted a spot kick as he scored for the second game running in Norway's 2-0 win against Latvia, with Mohamed Elyounoussi also on target in Oslo.Norway and the Netherlands are both a point back of Turkey, who go to Amsterdam this week.""Now we must win on Tuesday against Turkey.

196,US-Ukraine defense framework: a diplomatic show of Biden or a real milestone for Kiev?,Zhang Hong,2021-09-02,"During Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky's visit to the US, the two countries' defense ministers signed the Strategic Defense Framework that ""creates a foundation for the enhancement of US-Ukraine strategic defense and security cooperation,"" according to a White House statement on Wednesday. This is an important milestone for the US-Ukraine relationship, taking their security cooperation to the strategic partnership level. The Strategic Defense Framework reaffirms the key principles and sets out the ambitious goals of the bilateral relations in the field of defense, including Ukraine's aspirations to join NATO.This means that US-Ukraine military relations have entered a new phase. The US remains the world's strongest military power and has long been viewed by EU countries as the most important military partner and a key counterweight to Russia. After the Ukraine crisis, Kiev has not only pursued a lopsided pro-West policy, enshrining gaining full membership in the EU and NATO in its Constitution, but also been seeking to strengthen security cooperation with the US. US's position is of great significance to Kiev on its membership in NATO. So Ukraine has been improving and upgrading military relations as one of the priorities of its diplomacy with the US. Although the Strategic Defense Framework imposes no obligations on either side as a military ally, it does reaffirm US' support for Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity. It also provides technical details of military cooperation, and establishes a secure line of communication between the two countries. Before Volodymyr Zelensky's meeting with US President Joe Biden on Wednesday, a senior US administration official remarked at a press briefing that ""Joe Biden will announce his approval for a new $60 million security assistance package for Ukraine."" The package will include more Javelin anti-tank missiles. At a time of continuous tensions between the US and Russia, expanding military assistance to Ukraine serves to strengthen US's hand in its game with Moscow, bolstering its strategic influence in EU. Ukraine will receive not only military aid but also security confidence and diplomatic support from these gestures. Closer military ties with the US are an important diplomatic gain for Volodymyr Zelensky.However, there has always been a strategic red line in military cooperation between the US and Ukraine: At least in the short term, NATO will not accept Ukraine as a member. More than 30 years after the end of the Cold War, the US and Russia still have enough nuclear weapons to destroy the earth. Maintaining nuclear security has always been an important part of the US-Russia relationship. Even though the US values Ukraine's unique geopolitical role, it is also aware that issues about Ukraine is included in Russia's strategic red line. It knows that NATO membership could provoke a strong reaction from Moscow. Such being the case, the US attitude toward Ukraine has always been bold in words but cautious in practice. From Donald Trump to Joe Biden, US has been reluctant to get directly involved in Ukraine affair. Instead, both administrations have pushed the EU to the forefront of the game with Russia. Joe Biden has repeatedly stressed the need to maintain a ""stable, predictable"" relationship with Russia. Therefore, the military cooperation between the US and Ukraine must follow the principle of avoiding touching the red line of US-Russia relations. This decided that NATO will not accept Ukraine in short term.Against the backdrop of US' hasty withdrawal from Afghanistan, the Strategic Defense Framework with Ukraine is more of a formality, with its substantive meaning remaining to be seen. US military cooperation with Ukraine will not change the geopolitical balance of power in Eurasia region. Instead, this is more of a diplomatic show by the Joe Biden administration. The author is an associate research fellow at the Institute of Russia, EU & Central Asia Studies of the China Academy of Social Sciences. opinion@globaltimes.com.cn",OPINION,VIEWPOINT,"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky (L) meets with US President Joe Biden in the Oval Office at the White House on September 01, 2021 in Washington, DC.

199,Ukraine pins hopes on Gulf visitors to boost its pandemic-hit tourism,AFP,2021-09-01," 

A toy train in the city of Lviv, Ukraine Photo: VCG Saudi tourists ride horse-drawn carriages, pose for portraits by street artists and play chess on benches with locals in Lviv, a city in Ukraine more accustomed to hosting EU guests.But with strict COVID-19 travel restrictions still in place across EU, travellers from the Middle East - especially Saudi Arabia - now rank among the top visitors to the ex-Soviet state.The trend has given hope to the country's pandemic-hit tourism industry.""We need to seize the moment,"" says Bogdan Gets, a tour guide on a sightseeing train that ferries tourists along cobbled streets in central Lviv, a city in Ukraine known for its Renaissance architecture.For Gets and his colleagues at ""Chudo Tour"" (Wonder Tour), the unexpected influx of tourists from the Middle East is a chance to recover after a string of lockdowns that put pressure on Ukraine's struggling economy.In the first half of 2021, the number of Saudi tourists alone visiting Ukraine skyrocketed to 14,000 compared to just 350 in the same period in 2020, according to the country's state tourism agency.This new cohort are attracted by a visa-free regime enacted in August last year and cheap direct flights.In previous years, the city was mostly visited by Poles, Belarusians, Turks, Germans and Britons.""Last year put the tourism industry in extreme conditions"", the agency said, and ""radically changed"" how tourists decide which countries to visit. Before the pandemic 32-year-old Asma, a tourist from Saudi Arabia, travelled with her husband and two sons to various EU destinations every year, but never considered Ukraine.After exploring Lviv and the capital Kiev this summer, the family was pleasantly surprised. ""The bars, the food and the coffee - all things here in Ukraine are amazing,"" Asma told Agence France-Presse outside the iconic Lviv Opera.Rain is 'magic' Anna Nayda, the head of the Kredens Cafe chain, admitted that the local tourism industry experienced some initial difficulties when catering for their new customers.""At first it was very difficult to find a common language,"" she told Agence France-Presse. But now her cafes are printing menus in Arabic and replacing pork in their sandwiches to ensure they have halal options.Several souvenir shops in the city have started making signs in Arabic while ""Chudo Tour"" said they are translating their pre-recorded audio guides.""This is a push for change,"" Nayda said, adding that during the pandemic businesses struggled to pay rent and salaries.""Of course in these conditions you think about how to survive. We decided to make changes and everything turned out great,"" she said.Tourism to Ukraine is picking back up, but the climb is slow. After the number of tourists in 2020 was just a quarter of the level of the previous year in 2020, it was up nine percent in the first half year of 2021 compared to the second half year of 2020.The number of visitors from the Gulf - mainly Saudi Arabia and Bahrain - gradually increased throughout the summer, said Khrystyna Kaguy, a manager at the Reikartz hotel group.Hassan, a 64-year-old businessman from Saudi Arabia, opted for a family holiday in Ukraine on the recommendation of a friend.Compared to Germany or Switzerland, he described the country as ""more energetic, more dynamic"" and where the locals ""are family oriented"". ""We'll definitely come back,"" he told Agence France-Presse on a cafe terrace with his wife in Kiev.For tourists coming from arid conditions, trees and rain are a big draw.""The rooms that even slightly overlook the trees or the park are a big preference,"" Kaguy told Agence France-Presse.Gets, meanwhile, said he had never seen an adult so happy to see rain.""This is a thrill for them. They say that they came to Lviv on purpose, they are only interested in rain.""According to Asma, the rain is like ""magic"". ""Looks like heaven,"" she said.

203,"All sides should give Russia, Ukraine some space to resolve issue: Global Times editorial",Global Times,2022-02-23,"Russia President Vladimir Putin on Monday signed two decrees recognizing ""the Lugansk (LPR)"" and ""the Donetsk (DPR)"" as independent and sovereign states. Ukraine decided to recall its charge d'affairs in Russia and will reconsider its diplomatic relations with Russia. The sudden change in the Ukraine situation has aroused great concern around the world. In this regard, China State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi said on Tuesday that the legitimate security concerns of any country must be respected, and the purposes and principles of the UN Charter must be upheld. He said China once again called on all parties to exercise restraint, appreciate the importance of implementing the principle of indivisible security, and de-escalate the situation and resolve differences through dialogue and negotiations.It should be noted that it is very regrettable that the Ukraine issue has evolved so far. The US has continued its intensive containment on Russia, which finally forced Russia to try to realize its security demands in such a way. This is the outburst of the dissatisfaction of the party whose security demands have been ignored for a long time since the end of the Cold War. The situation in Ukraine is deteriorating. At this time, the international community cannot discard its efforts for peace and to avoid further escalating the situation.The prospect of the situation between Russia and Ukraine remains highly uncertain. The US and West countries immediately condemned Russia's move. The White House officials said further ""coordinated"" sanctions directed at Russia would be announced on Tuesday. UN Secretary-General António Guterres said Russia's decision is ""a violation of the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Ukraine and inconsistent with the principles of the Charter of the UN."" He called for addressing ""all issues peacefully."" Many countries said they should not give up diplomatic means to peacefully solve the problem and underlined that ""constructive diplomacy is the need of the hour.""The Russia-Ukraine crisis is a dual crisis, in which bilateral conflicts between Russia and Ukraine are intertwined with the strategic suppression that NATO's eastward expansion has brought to Russia. All relevant parties have put forward their own security demands before. Although no consensus was reached, that doesn't necessarily mean a complete breakup of negotiations. It hasn't reached the point that the issue must be solved by war. Whether the situation will further escalate next mainly depends on the scale of the US sanctions imposed on Russia and whether Russia will be provoked to take more aggressive measures.Peace and no war is in the biggest and common interests of all countries in the EU continent. In this sense, only by achieving a soft landing for the Russia-Ukraine crisis can EU realize peace. True security should be inalienable, common, integrated, cooperative and sustainable. This means all sides' security interests should be respected and safeguarded, and if any party's security concerns are ignored or even trampled on, geopolitical disputes will continue and never cease. The knot must be untied by the one who tied it. Russia and Ukraine need to have face-to-face dialogues. The US and NATO should be pulled back from the Russia-Ukraine crisis as much as possible and there should be no more complicated elements added to influence the situation.In particular, at a time when the situation is uncertain, all sides should leave some space for Russia and Ukraine to solve the problems. Confrontation, sanctions, or even a direct battle will not help ease tensions. The flames scattered in eastern Ukraine are reminding all parties of the fact that blindly imposing pressure will only lead to an escalation of conflicts. What is most needed there are restraints and rationality, as well as constructive efforts of the international community.   China has no self-interest in the Ukraine issue. It has always upheld a fair and responsible attitude and will decide its own position based on the merits of the matter itself. Although all parties have different views on the Ukraine crisis, the top priority now is to avoid any actions that could intensify tensions. The international community should reach such a consensus as soon as possible. The development of the Ukraine situation is the result of a series of complex factors. Now that it has come to the brink of a cliff, all parties should work together to pull it back.",OPINION,EDITORIAL,"United Nations Security Council meets after Russia recognized two breakaway regions in eastern Ukraine as independent entities, in New York City on Monday.

207,"EU agrees Russia sanctions package, warns of further action",Xinhua,2022-02-23," The EU (EU) is ready to take further action against Russia if it continues to escalate the crisis, EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen warned here on Tuesday.In a statement, von der Leyen said EU member states had given their political consent to a new package of sanctions against Russia following its recognition of the independence of the Ukraine regions of Donetsk and Luhansk.The package contains a number of ""calibrated measures"" targeting banks that finance the Russia military apparatus and contribute to the destabilization of Ukraine.It also bans trade between the two breakaway regions and the EU, as it did with Crimea in 2014, and limits the Russia government's ability to raise capital on the EU's financial markets.Russia President Vladimir Putin on Monday evening signed decrees recognizing the independence of two self-proclaimed regions in eastern Ukraine's Donbass as ""the Lugansk (LPR)"" and ""the Donetsk (DPR).""Russia has done everything to preserve the territorial integrity of Ukraine by fighting for the implementation of 2015 Minsk agreement, but all the efforts ended up in vain, Vladimir Putin said on Monday.The security crisis occurred due to NATO's eastward expansion, which has led to the loss of mutual trust with Russia, he noted.According to Josep Borrell, EU's High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, the package comprises sanctions against 351 members of the Russia State Duma (lower house of the country's Federal Assembly) who voted to recognize the two regions.The EU will also ""target 27 individuals and entities who are playing a role in undermining or threatening Ukraine's territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence,"" he said.Furthermore, the sanctions aim to target the Russia state's ability to access the EU's capital and financial markets and services.""If Russia continues to escalate this crisis that it has created, we are ready to take further action in response,"" von der Leyen said.On the controversial Russia-Germany Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, von der Leyen said she believed that the Germany government was ""absolutely right"" to stop the project, which must be assessed in light of the security of energy supply for all of EU.""This crisis shows that EU is still too dependent on Russia gas. We have to diversify our suppliers and massively invest in renewables. This is a strategic investment in our energy independence,"" she said.The conflict in eastern Ukraine began in April 2014 with fightings between the Ukraine government troops and local armed groups who seized several towns.With the mediation of the global community, the two sides in Belarus' capital of Minsk reached ceasefire agreements in September 2014 and February 2015 respectively.Russia has been seeking NATO's guarantee to halt eastward expansion. However, U.S. President Joe Biden's administration took a hard line against Russia, supporting Ukraine's efforts to join the U.S.-led military alliance and increasing its military assistance to Ukraine, which has re-escalated tensions in the region.The situation in eastern Ukraine has been getting worse since Feb. 17, as the Ukraine government and local armed groups blamed each other for launching aggressive bombards.",WORLD,EUROPE,"European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen makes a statement on the Ukraine issue in Brussels, Belgium, on Feb. 22, 2022.

Ukraine refused to recognize their self-proclaimed status.Calling Russia's move ""the beginning of a Russia invasion of Ukraine,"" Joe Biden said in remarks delivered from the White House that his administration will impose sanctions on two Russia financial institutions - the VEB and the country's military bank -- as well as on Russia's sovereign debt and three individuals.He explained that the measure ""means we've cut off Russia's government from West financing.

211,"US hardly leads the West out of helplessness, but is in fact the cause",Zhao Minghao,2022-02-23,"The Munich Security Conference 2022 was held under the shadow of multiple challenges including the Ukraine crisis. The Munich Security Index 2022 shows perceptions of risk that pervade the societies of G7 countries due to COVID-19 pandemic, geopolitical tensions, domestic political polarization, and rising inequality. As the Munich Security Report 2022 points out, many West people believe that they are living in a ""new era of successive and interconnected disruptions,"" and there is a growing ""collective helplessness.""Such helplessness comes from domestic political dysfunction. Economic inequality, ethnic tensions, and intergenerational conflicts are old problems that become even worse in a polarized political environment. The stagnation of political reforms has largely contributed to ""crisis fatigue"" within the G7 countries mentioned in the Munich Security Report 2022. People feel less confident in their governments. According to a recent NBC News poll, only 22 percent answered that things are ""headed in the right direction.""The trend toward the retreat of democracy continues, warned Wolfgang Ischinger, chairman of the Munich Security Conference. The ""illiberal movement"" within the West is worsening, and there are challenges like populism and neo-fascism. US leadership in the West has been damaged due to its domestic illiberal movement. During the Joe Biden presidency, the US is more divided under the crisis of democracy. Helplessness stems from the external challenges West countries face, which are often self-imposed. NATO enlargement and the EU's expansion eastward are the key factors influencing Russia's strong responses to the Ukraine crisis, according to John Mearsheimer, professor at the University of Chicago. He pointed out that the Ukraine crisis is the West's fault as the West had been moving into Russia's backyard and threatening its core strategic interests. Indeed, Ukraine has the right to make a choice, but that choice should not expose its neighbor to a major security threat. Given the US and EU interference in Ukraine, it's hard to argue that Kiev's choice is truly ""independent."" Leaked classified documents show that senior US officials like Victoria Nuland, US' current under secretary of state for political affairs, have been weighing in on the make-up of the Ukraine government. For the US, the survival of NATO depends on deliberately created geopolitical tensions. The Obama administration's actions during the Russo-Georgian War and the Joe Biden administration's moves during the recent Ukraine crisis show to the world a rattled US government. ""Helpless"" EU must realize that there is indeed a geopolitical factor. Some EU countries, including Germany, seem to be interested in participating in the geopolitical game in the Indo-Pacific region, following US to provoke Beijing on the Taiwan question. This will bring them into trouble. Another contribution to the West's helplessness is the Afghanistan issue. With the hasty withdrawal of the US troops from Afghanistan, the humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan is getting worse because of the de facto US sanctions against the Taliban. The West does have a sense of frustration over Afghanistan, but it cannot be allowed to shrug off its responsibility in an immoral matter. The West is facing what former EU Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker called a ""polycrisis."" The US is hardly leading the West out of helplessness, and is in fact the cause. As the Munich Security Report 2022 emphasizes, collectively, they have the chance to turn the tide. Individually they risk being swept away. EU needs to make efforts to this end, especially to persuade US not to indulge in confrontations with China and Russia. The author is a senior fellow at the Charhar Institute and China Forum Expert at Tsinghua University. opinion@globaltimes.com.cn",OPINION,VIEWPOINT,"Outgoing Munich Security Conference Chairman Wolfgang Ischinger speaks at the end of the Munich Security Conference (MSC) in Munich, southern Germany, on February 20, 2022.

212,Can US’ balancing strategy last after Ukraine crisis?,Ding Gang,2022-02-23,"On February 21, 1972, US President Richard Nixon came to Beijing to begin a ""world-changing"" visit. He became the first sitting US president to visit China.On February 28, China and the US issued the Shanghai Joint Communiqué, which laid the foundation for the subsequent development of US-China relations.Twenty years ago, in February 2002, I interviewed Dr Kissinger in New York. Over the past two days, I have gone over my notes from that interview and have been filled with emotion.The China-US relationship seems to have gone through a strange circle, from breaking the ice in 1972, to steadily rising to a warm point in 2002, and then beginning to freeze again.The world is also in the midst of dramatic change. From Chairman Mao Zedong's handshake with President Nixon, to former President Donald Trump's ""decoupling"" with, to China-Russia back-to-back partnership today, and the outbreak of the Ukraine crisis, great powers are beginning to reorganize.I clearly remember Dr Kissinger telling me at the time that the breakthrough in the Shanghai Communiqué was largely due to a mutual recognition that establishing direct contacts was possible and in the interest of both sides.Kissinger said President Nixon made the goal of establishing diplomatic relations with China an integral part of his international strategy as soon as he took office. The China side had the same consideration.According to Kissinger, there were also concerns on the China side at the time about the threat from the Soviet Union. Those were the two bases on which the Shanghai Communiqué made its breakthrough. The basic spirit of the communiqué, in his view, was to establish a direct cooperative relationship between the US and China.The two foundations Dr Kissinger spoke of reflect his idea of a balanced strategy. The central idea of his book World Order was that a balance of power based on the Peace of Westphalia was the key to avoiding war and building peace.This idea of strategic balance still influences US's global strategy today, and the adjustment of US policy toward China clearly comes from this idea.In recent years, some in US have insisted that the US-China relationship is headed for a breakdown because China has adopted a more aggressive strategy of foreign expansion, undermining the order that the US has worked on for years to establish in the Asia-Pacific region and is upsetting the global balance of power.Some US scholars also cited Kissinger's advice before Nixon's visit to China 50 years ago.According to declassified documents, Kissinger told Nixon at the time that the US should ""play the balance of power game without any emotion.""Kissinger also predicted that in 20 years, China would be ""even more powerful"" and reminded the US president at that time to consider how to rely on Russia to keep China down.Such a balance of power game is to create a US-led structure to balance the relationship between global powers. Essentially it is not about trying to cooperate with the other side, but to ensure that the US can suppress and dismantle the other side in order to achieve US hegemony. Such a balancing structure will eventually force many small and medium-sized countries to choose sides. The crisis in Ukraine, which has gone so far, is a typical example.However, after China's peaceful rise, such a balancing strategy has become increasingly difficult to achieve. China and the US have become increasingly interdependent over the course of the past 50 years, and it is clear that their relationship is no longer tempered by equilibrium. Any forces that US would like to leverage to reorganize the so-called balance will hardly stop China's continued development.Fifty years ago, the US-China relationship made a breakthrough because of the US balancing strategy, and now, 50 years later, the relationship is beginning to ""decouple."" This is because, in US's balanced strategy, it has never seen itself as a party that can be on an equal footing with its so-called rivals, but always calculating how to prevent other countries from challenging its hegemonic position.The author is a senior editor with People's Daily, and currently a senior fellow with the Chongyang Institute for Financial Studies at Renmin University of China. dinggang@globaltimes.com.cn.

213,"All sides should give Russia, Ukraine some space to resolve issue: Global Times editorial",Global Times,2022-02-23,"Russia President Vladimir Putin on Monday signed two decrees recognizing ""the Lugansk (LPR)"" and ""the Donetsk (DPR)"" as independent and sovereign states. Ukraine decided to recall its charge d'affairs in Russia and will reconsider its diplomatic relations with Russia. The sudden change in the Ukraine situation has aroused great concern around the world. In this regard, China State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi said on Tuesday that the legitimate security concerns of any country must be respected, and the purposes and principles of the UN Charter must be upheld. He said China once again called on all parties to exercise restraint, appreciate the importance of implementing the principle of indivisible security, and de-escalate the situation and resolve differences through dialogue and negotiations.It should be noted that it is very regrettable that the Ukraine issue has evolved so far. The US has continued its intensive containment on Russia, which finally forced Russia to try to realize its security demands in such a way. This is the outburst of the dissatisfaction of the party whose security demands have been ignored for a long time since the end of the Cold War. The situation in Ukraine is deteriorating. At this time, the international community cannot discard its efforts for peace and to avoid further escalating the situation.The prospect of the situation between Russia and Ukraine remains highly uncertain. The US and West countries immediately condemned Russia's move. The White House officials said further ""coordinated"" sanctions directed at Russia would be announced on Tuesday. UN Secretary-General António Guterres said Russia's decision is ""a violation of the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Ukraine and inconsistent with the principles of the Charter of the UN."" He called for addressing ""all issues peacefully."" Many countries said they should not give up diplomatic means to peacefully solve the problem and underlined that ""constructive diplomacy is the need of the hour.""The Russia-Ukraine crisis is a dual crisis, in which bilateral conflicts between Russia and Ukraine are intertwined with the strategic suppression that NATO's eastward expansion has brought to Russia. All relevant parties have put forward their own security demands before. Although no consensus was reached, that doesn't necessarily mean a complete breakup of negotiations. It hasn't reached the point that the issue must be solved by war. Whether the situation will further escalate next mainly depends on the scale of the US sanctions imposed on Russia and whether Russia will be provoked to take more aggressive measures.Peace and no war is in the biggest and common interests of all countries in the EU continent. In this sense, only by achieving a soft landing for the Russia-Ukraine crisis can EU realize peace. True security should be inalienable, common, integrated, cooperative and sustainable. This means all sides' security interests should be respected and safeguarded, and if any party's security concerns are ignored or even trampled on, geopolitical disputes will continue and never cease. The knot must be untied by the one who tied it. Russia and Ukraine need to have face-to-face dialogues. The US and NATO should be pulled back from the Russia-Ukraine crisis as much as possible and there should be no more complicated elements added to influence the situation.In particular, at a time when the situation is uncertain, all sides should leave some space for Russia and Ukraine to solve the problems. Confrontation, sanctions, or even a direct battle will not help ease tensions. The flames scattered in eastern Ukraine are reminding all parties of the fact that blindly imposing pressure will only lead to an escalation of conflicts. What is most needed there are restraints and rationality, as well as constructive efforts of the international community.   China has no self-interest in the Ukraine issue. It has always upheld a fair and responsible attitude and will decide its own position based on the merits of the matter itself. Although all parties have different views on the Ukraine crisis, the top priority now is to avoid any actions that could intensify tensions. The international community should reach such a consensus as soon as possible. The development of the Ukraine situation is the result of a series of complex factors. Now that it has come to the brink of a cliff, all parties should work together to pull it back.",OPINION,EDITORIAL,"United Nations Security Council meets after Russia recognized two breakaway regions in eastern Ukraine as independent entities, in New York City on Monday.

217,"EU agrees Russia sanctions package, warns of further action",Xinhua,2022-02-23," The EU (EU) is ready to take further action against Russia if it continues to escalate the crisis, EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen warned here on Tuesday.In a statement, von der Leyen said EU member states had given their political consent to a new package of sanctions against Russia following its recognition of the independence of the Ukraine regions of Donetsk and Luhansk.The package contains a number of ""calibrated measures"" targeting banks that finance the Russia military apparatus and contribute to the destabilization of Ukraine.It also bans trade between the two breakaway regions and the EU, as it did with Crimea in 2014, and limits the Russia government's ability to raise capital on the EU's financial markets.Russia President Vladimir Putin on Monday evening signed decrees recognizing the independence of two self-proclaimed regions in eastern Ukraine's Donbass as ""the Lugansk (LPR)"" and ""the Donetsk (DPR).""Russia has done everything to preserve the territorial integrity of Ukraine by fighting for the implementation of 2015 Minsk agreement, but all the efforts ended up in vain, Vladimir Putin said on Monday.The security crisis occurred due to NATO's eastward expansion, which has led to the loss of mutual trust with Russia, he noted.According to Josep Borrell, EU's High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, the package comprises sanctions against 351 members of the Russia State Duma (lower house of the country's Federal Assembly) who voted to recognize the two regions.The EU will also ""target 27 individuals and entities who are playing a role in undermining or threatening Ukraine's territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence,"" he said.Furthermore, the sanctions aim to target the Russia state's ability to access the EU's capital and financial markets and services.""If Russia continues to escalate this crisis that it has created, we are ready to take further action in response,"" von der Leyen said.On the controversial Russia-Germany Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, von der Leyen said she believed that the Germany government was ""absolutely right"" to stop the project, which must be assessed in light of the security of energy supply for all of EU.""This crisis shows that EU is still too dependent on Russia gas. We have to diversify our suppliers and massively invest in renewables. This is a strategic investment in our energy independence,"" she said.The conflict in eastern Ukraine began in April 2014 with fightings between the Ukraine government troops and local armed groups who seized several towns.With the mediation of the global community, the two sides in Belarus' capital of Minsk reached ceasefire agreements in September 2014 and February 2015 respectively.Russia has been seeking NATO's guarantee to halt eastward expansion. However, U.S. President Joe Biden's administration took a hard line against Russia, supporting Ukraine's efforts to join the U.S.-led military alliance and increasing its military assistance to Ukraine, which has re-escalated tensions in the region.The situation in eastern Ukraine has been getting worse since Feb. 17, as the Ukraine government and local armed groups blamed each other for launching aggressive bombards.",WORLD,EUROPE,"European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen makes a statement on the Ukraine issue in Brussels, Belgium, on Feb. 22, 2022.

Ukraine refused to recognize their self-proclaimed status.Calling Russia's move ""the beginning of a Russia invasion of Ukraine,"" Joe Biden said in remarks delivered from the White House that his administration will impose sanctions on two Russia financial institutions - the VEB and the country's military bank -- as well as on Russia's sovereign debt and three individuals.He explained that the measure ""means we've cut off Russia's government from West financing.

221,"US hardly leads the West out of helplessness, but is in fact the cause",Zhao Minghao,2022-02-23,"The Munich Security Conference 2022 was held under the shadow of multiple challenges including the Ukraine crisis. The Munich Security Index 2022 shows perceptions of risk that pervade the societies of G7 countries due to COVID-19 pandemic, geopolitical tensions, domestic political polarization, and rising inequality. As the Munich Security Report 2022 points out, many West people believe that they are living in a ""new era of successive and interconnected disruptions,"" and there is a growing ""collective helplessness.""Such helplessness comes from domestic political dysfunction. Economic inequality, ethnic tensions, and intergenerational conflicts are old problems that become even worse in a polarized political environment. The stagnation of political reforms has largely contributed to ""crisis fatigue"" within the G7 countries mentioned in the Munich Security Report 2022. People feel less confident in their governments. According to a recent NBC News poll, only 22 percent answered that things are ""headed in the right direction.""The trend toward the retreat of democracy continues, warned Wolfgang Ischinger, chairman of the Munich Security Conference. The ""illiberal movement"" within the West is worsening, and there are challenges like populism and neo-fascism. US leadership in the West has been damaged due to its domestic illiberal movement. During the Joe Biden presidency, the US is more divided under the crisis of democracy. Helplessness stems from the external challenges West countries face, which are often self-imposed. NATO enlargement and the EU's expansion eastward are the key factors influencing Russia's strong responses to the Ukraine crisis, according to John Mearsheimer, professor at the University of Chicago. He pointed out that the Ukraine crisis is the West's fault as the West had been moving into Russia's backyard and threatening its core strategic interests. Indeed, Ukraine has the right to make a choice, but that choice should not expose its neighbor to a major security threat. Given the US and EU interference in Ukraine, it's hard to argue that Kiev's choice is truly ""independent."" Leaked classified documents show that senior US officials like Victoria Nuland, US' current under secretary of state for political affairs, have been weighing in on the make-up of the Ukraine government. For the US, the survival of NATO depends on deliberately created geopolitical tensions. The Obama administration's actions during the Russo-Georgian War and the Joe Biden administration's moves during the recent Ukraine crisis show to the world a rattled US government. ""Helpless"" EU must realize that there is indeed a geopolitical factor. Some EU countries, including Germany, seem to be interested in participating in the geopolitical game in the Indo-Pacific region, following US to provoke Beijing on the Taiwan question. This will bring them into trouble. Another contribution to the West's helplessness is the Afghanistan issue. With the hasty withdrawal of the US troops from Afghanistan, the humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan is getting worse because of the de facto US sanctions against the Taliban. The West does have a sense of frustration over Afghanistan, but it cannot be allowed to shrug off its responsibility in an immoral matter. The West is facing what former EU Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker called a ""polycrisis."" The US is hardly leading the West out of helplessness, and is in fact the cause. As the Munich Security Report 2022 emphasizes, collectively, they have the chance to turn the tide. Individually they risk being swept away. EU needs to make efforts to this end, especially to persuade US not to indulge in confrontations with China and Russia. The author is a senior fellow at the Charhar Institute and China Forum Expert at Tsinghua University. opinion@globaltimes.com.cn",OPINION,VIEWPOINT,"Outgoing Munich Security Conference Chairman Wolfgang Ischinger speaks at the end of the Munich Security Conference (MSC) in Munich, southern Germany, on February 20, 2022.

222,Can US’ balancing strategy last after Ukraine crisis?,Ding Gang,2022-02-23,"On February 21, 1972, US President Richard Nixon came to Beijing to begin a ""world-changing"" visit. He became the first sitting US president to visit China.On February 28, China and the US issued the Shanghai Joint Communiqué, which laid the foundation for the subsequent development of US-China relations.Twenty years ago, in February 2002, I interviewed Dr Kissinger in New York. Over the past two days, I have gone over my notes from that interview and have been filled with emotion.The China-US relationship seems to have gone through a strange circle, from breaking the ice in 1972, to steadily rising to a warm point in 2002, and then beginning to freeze again.The world is also in the midst of dramatic change. From Chairman Mao Zedong's handshake with President Nixon, to former President Donald Trump's ""decoupling"" with, to China-Russia back-to-back partnership today, and the outbreak of the Ukraine crisis, great powers are beginning to reorganize.I clearly remember Dr Kissinger telling me at the time that the breakthrough in the Shanghai Communiqué was largely due to a mutual recognition that establishing direct contacts was possible and in the interest of both sides.Kissinger said President Nixon made the goal of establishing diplomatic relations with China an integral part of his international strategy as soon as he took office. The China side had the same consideration.According to Kissinger, there were also concerns on the China side at the time about the threat from the Soviet Union. Those were the two bases on which the Shanghai Communiqué made its breakthrough. The basic spirit of the communiqué, in his view, was to establish a direct cooperative relationship between the US and China.The two foundations Dr Kissinger spoke of reflect his idea of a balanced strategy. The central idea of his book World Order was that a balance of power based on the Peace of Westphalia was the key to avoiding war and building peace.This idea of strategic balance still influences US's global strategy today, and the adjustment of US policy toward China clearly comes from this idea.In recent years, some in US have insisted that the US-China relationship is headed for a breakdown because China has adopted a more aggressive strategy of foreign expansion, undermining the order that the US has worked on for years to establish in the Asia-Pacific region and is upsetting the global balance of power.Some US scholars also cited Kissinger's advice before Nixon's visit to China 50 years ago.According to declassified documents, Kissinger told Nixon at the time that the US should ""play the balance of power game without any emotion.""Kissinger also predicted that in 20 years, China would be ""even more powerful"" and reminded the US president at that time to consider how to rely on Russia to keep China down.Such a balance of power game is to create a US-led structure to balance the relationship between global powers. Essentially it is not about trying to cooperate with the other side, but to ensure that the US can suppress and dismantle the other side in order to achieve US hegemony. Such a balancing structure will eventually force many small and medium-sized countries to choose sides. The crisis in Ukraine, which has gone so far, is a typical example.However, after China's peaceful rise, such a balancing strategy has become increasingly difficult to achieve. China and the US have become increasingly interdependent over the course of the past 50 years, and it is clear that their relationship is no longer tempered by equilibrium. Any forces that US would like to leverage to reorganize the so-called balance will hardly stop China's continued development.Fifty years ago, the US-China relationship made a breakthrough because of the US balancing strategy, and now, 50 years later, the relationship is beginning to ""decouple."" This is because, in US's balanced strategy, it has never seen itself as a party that can be on an equal footing with its so-called rivals, but always calculating how to prevent other countries from challenging its hegemonic position.The author is a senior editor with People's Daily, and currently a senior fellow with the Chongyang Institute for Financial Studies at Renmin University of China. dinggang@globaltimes.com.cn.

223,"All sides should give Russia, Ukraine some space to resolve issue: Global Times editorial",Global Times,2022-02-23,"Russia President Vladimir Putin on Monday signed two decrees recognizing ""the Lugansk (LPR)"" and ""the Donetsk (DPR)"" as independent and sovereign states. Ukraine decided to recall its charge d'affairs in Russia and will reconsider its diplomatic relations with Russia. The sudden change in the Ukraine situation has aroused great concern around the world. In this regard, China State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi said on Tuesday that the legitimate security concerns of any country must be respected, and the purposes and principles of the UN Charter must be upheld. He said China once again called on all parties to exercise restraint, appreciate the importance of implementing the principle of indivisible security, and de-escalate the situation and resolve differences through dialogue and negotiations.It should be noted that it is very regrettable that the Ukraine issue has evolved so far. The US has continued its intensive containment on Russia, which finally forced Russia to try to realize its security demands in such a way. This is the outburst of the dissatisfaction of the party whose security demands have been ignored for a long time since the end of the Cold War. The situation in Ukraine is deteriorating. At this time, the international community cannot discard its efforts for peace and to avoid further escalating the situation.The prospect of the situation between Russia and Ukraine remains highly uncertain. The US and West countries immediately condemned Russia's move. The White House officials said further ""coordinated"" sanctions directed at Russia would be announced on Tuesday. UN Secretary-General António Guterres said Russia's decision is ""a violation of the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Ukraine and inconsistent with the principles of the Charter of the UN."" He called for addressing ""all issues peacefully."" Many countries said they should not give up diplomatic means to peacefully solve the problem and underlined that ""constructive diplomacy is the need of the hour.""The Russia-Ukraine crisis is a dual crisis, in which bilateral conflicts between Russia and Ukraine are intertwined with the strategic suppression that NATO's eastward expansion has brought to Russia. All relevant parties have put forward their own security demands before. Although no consensus was reached, that doesn't necessarily mean a complete breakup of negotiations. It hasn't reached the point that the issue must be solved by war. Whether the situation will further escalate next mainly depends on the scale of the US sanctions imposed on Russia and whether Russia will be provoked to take more aggressive measures.Peace and no war is in the biggest and common interests of all countries in the EU continent. In this sense, only by achieving a soft landing for the Russia-Ukraine crisis can EU realize peace. True security should be inalienable, common, integrated, cooperative and sustainable. This means all sides' security interests should be respected and safeguarded, and if any party's security concerns are ignored or even trampled on, geopolitical disputes will continue and never cease. The knot must be untied by the one who tied it. Russia and Ukraine need to have face-to-face dialogues. The US and NATO should be pulled back from the Russia-Ukraine crisis as much as possible and there should be no more complicated elements added to influence the situation.In particular, at a time when the situation is uncertain, all sides should leave some space for Russia and Ukraine to solve the problems. Confrontation, sanctions, or even a direct battle will not help ease tensions. The flames scattered in eastern Ukraine are reminding all parties of the fact that blindly imposing pressure will only lead to an escalation of conflicts. What is most needed there are restraints and rationality, as well as constructive efforts of the international community.   China has no self-interest in the Ukraine issue. It has always upheld a fair and responsible attitude and will decide its own position based on the merits of the matter itself. Although all parties have different views on the Ukraine crisis, the top priority now is to avoid any actions that could intensify tensions. The international community should reach such a consensus as soon as possible. The development of the Ukraine situation is the result of a series of complex factors. Now that it has come to the brink of a cliff, all parties should work together to pull it back.",OPINION,EDITORIAL,"United Nations Security Council meets after Russia recognized two breakaway regions in eastern Ukraine as independent entities, in New York City on Monday.

227,"EU agrees Russia sanctions package, warns of further action",Xinhua,2022-02-23," The EU (EU) is ready to take further action against Russia if it continues to escalate the crisis, EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen warned here on Tuesday.In a statement, von der Leyen said EU member states had given their political consent to a new package of sanctions against Russia following its recognition of the independence of the Ukraine regions of Donetsk and Luhansk.The package contains a number of ""calibrated measures"" targeting banks that finance the Russia military apparatus and contribute to the destabilization of Ukraine.It also bans trade between the two breakaway regions and the EU, as it did with Crimea in 2014, and limits the Russia government's ability to raise capital on the EU's financial markets.Russia President Vladimir Putin on Monday evening signed decrees recognizing the independence of two self-proclaimed regions in eastern Ukraine's Donbass as ""the Lugansk (LPR)"" and ""the Donetsk (DPR).""Russia has done everything to preserve the territorial integrity of Ukraine by fighting for the implementation of 2015 Minsk agreement, but all the efforts ended up in vain, Vladimir Putin said on Monday.The security crisis occurred due to NATO's eastward expansion, which has led to the loss of mutual trust with Russia, he noted.According to Josep Borrell, EU's High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, the package comprises sanctions against 351 members of the Russia State Duma (lower house of the country's Federal Assembly) who voted to recognize the two regions.The EU will also ""target 27 individuals and entities who are playing a role in undermining or threatening Ukraine's territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence,"" he said.Furthermore, the sanctions aim to target the Russia state's ability to access the EU's capital and financial markets and services.""If Russia continues to escalate this crisis that it has created, we are ready to take further action in response,"" von der Leyen said.On the controversial Russia-Germany Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, von der Leyen said she believed that the Germany government was ""absolutely right"" to stop the project, which must be assessed in light of the security of energy supply for all of EU.""This crisis shows that EU is still too dependent on Russia gas. We have to diversify our suppliers and massively invest in renewables. This is a strategic investment in our energy independence,"" she said.The conflict in eastern Ukraine began in April 2014 with fightings between the Ukraine government troops and local armed groups who seized several towns.With the mediation of the global community, the two sides in Belarus' capital of Minsk reached ceasefire agreements in September 2014 and February 2015 respectively.Russia has been seeking NATO's guarantee to halt eastward expansion. However, U.S. President Joe Biden's administration took a hard line against Russia, supporting Ukraine's efforts to join the U.S.-led military alliance and increasing its military assistance to Ukraine, which has re-escalated tensions in the region.The situation in eastern Ukraine has been getting worse since Feb. 17, as the Ukraine government and local armed groups blamed each other for launching aggressive bombards.",WORLD,EUROPE,"European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen makes a statement on the Ukraine issue in Brussels, Belgium, on Feb. 22, 2022.

Ukraine refused to recognize their self-proclaimed status.Calling Russia's move ""the beginning of a Russia invasion of Ukraine,"" Joe Biden said in remarks delivered from the White House that his administration will impose sanctions on two Russia financial institutions - the VEB and the country's military bank -- as well as on Russia's sovereign debt and three individuals.He explained that the measure ""means we've cut off Russia's government from West financing.

231,"US hardly leads the West out of helplessness, but is in fact the cause",Zhao Minghao,2022-02-23,"The Munich Security Conference 2022 was held under the shadow of multiple challenges including the Ukraine crisis. The Munich Security Index 2022 shows perceptions of risk that pervade the societies of G7 countries due to COVID-19 pandemic, geopolitical tensions, domestic political polarization, and rising inequality. As the Munich Security Report 2022 points out, many West people believe that they are living in a ""new era of successive and interconnected disruptions,"" and there is a growing ""collective helplessness.""Such helplessness comes from domestic political dysfunction. Economic inequality, ethnic tensions, and intergenerational conflicts are old problems that become even worse in a polarized political environment. The stagnation of political reforms has largely contributed to ""crisis fatigue"" within the G7 countries mentioned in the Munich Security Report 2022. People feel less confident in their governments. According to a recent NBC News poll, only 22 percent answered that things are ""headed in the right direction.""The trend toward the retreat of democracy continues, warned Wolfgang Ischinger, chairman of the Munich Security Conference. The ""illiberal movement"" within the West is worsening, and there are challenges like populism and neo-fascism. US leadership in the West has been damaged due to its domestic illiberal movement. During the Joe Biden presidency, the US is more divided under the crisis of democracy. Helplessness stems from the external challenges West countries face, which are often self-imposed. NATO enlargement and the EU's expansion eastward are the key factors influencing Russia's strong responses to the Ukraine crisis, according to John Mearsheimer, professor at the University of Chicago. He pointed out that the Ukraine crisis is the West's fault as the West had been moving into Russia's backyard and threatening its core strategic interests. Indeed, Ukraine has the right to make a choice, but that choice should not expose its neighbor to a major security threat. Given the US and EU interference in Ukraine, it's hard to argue that Kiev's choice is truly ""independent."" Leaked classified documents show that senior US officials like Victoria Nuland, US' current under secretary of state for political affairs, have been weighing in on the make-up of the Ukraine government. For the US, the survival of NATO depends on deliberately created geopolitical tensions. The Obama administration's actions during the Russo-Georgian War and the Joe Biden administration's moves during the recent Ukraine crisis show to the world a rattled US government. ""Helpless"" EU must realize that there is indeed a geopolitical factor. Some EU countries, including Germany, seem to be interested in participating in the geopolitical game in the Indo-Pacific region, following US to provoke Beijing on the Taiwan question. This will bring them into trouble. Another contribution to the West's helplessness is the Afghanistan issue. With the hasty withdrawal of the US troops from Afghanistan, the humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan is getting worse because of the de facto US sanctions against the Taliban. The West does have a sense of frustration over Afghanistan, but it cannot be allowed to shrug off its responsibility in an immoral matter. The West is facing what former EU Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker called a ""polycrisis."" The US is hardly leading the West out of helplessness, and is in fact the cause. As the Munich Security Report 2022 emphasizes, collectively, they have the chance to turn the tide. Individually they risk being swept away. EU needs to make efforts to this end, especially to persuade US not to indulge in confrontations with China and Russia. The author is a senior fellow at the Charhar Institute and China Forum Expert at Tsinghua University. opinion@globaltimes.com.cn",OPINION,VIEWPOINT,"Outgoing Munich Security Conference Chairman Wolfgang Ischinger speaks at the end of the Munich Security Conference (MSC) in Munich, southern Germany, on February 20, 2022.

232,Can US’ balancing strategy last after Ukraine crisis?,Ding Gang,2022-02-23,"On February 21, 1972, US President Richard Nixon came to Beijing to begin a ""world-changing"" visit. He became the first sitting US president to visit China.On February 28, China and the US issued the Shanghai Joint Communiqué, which laid the foundation for the subsequent development of US-China relations.Twenty years ago, in February 2002, I interviewed Dr Kissinger in New York. Over the past two days, I have gone over my notes from that interview and have been filled with emotion.The China-US relationship seems to have gone through a strange circle, from breaking the ice in 1972, to steadily rising to a warm point in 2002, and then beginning to freeze again.The world is also in the midst of dramatic change. From Chairman Mao Zedong's handshake with President Nixon, to former President Donald Trump's ""decoupling"" with, to China-Russia back-to-back partnership today, and the outbreak of the Ukraine crisis, great powers are beginning to reorganize.I clearly remember Dr Kissinger telling me at the time that the breakthrough in the Shanghai Communiqué was largely due to a mutual recognition that establishing direct contacts was possible and in the interest of both sides.Kissinger said President Nixon made the goal of establishing diplomatic relations with China an integral part of his international strategy as soon as he took office. The China side had the same consideration.According to Kissinger, there were also concerns on the China side at the time about the threat from the Soviet Union. Those were the two bases on which the Shanghai Communiqué made its breakthrough. The basic spirit of the communiqué, in his view, was to establish a direct cooperative relationship between the US and China.The two foundations Dr Kissinger spoke of reflect his idea of a balanced strategy. The central idea of his book World Order was that a balance of power based on the Peace of Westphalia was the key to avoiding war and building peace.This idea of strategic balance still influences US's global strategy today, and the adjustment of US policy toward China clearly comes from this idea.In recent years, some in US have insisted that the US-China relationship is headed for a breakdown because China has adopted a more aggressive strategy of foreign expansion, undermining the order that the US has worked on for years to establish in the Asia-Pacific region and is upsetting the global balance of power.Some US scholars also cited Kissinger's advice before Nixon's visit to China 50 years ago.According to declassified documents, Kissinger told Nixon at the time that the US should ""play the balance of power game without any emotion.""Kissinger also predicted that in 20 years, China would be ""even more powerful"" and reminded the US president at that time to consider how to rely on Russia to keep China down.Such a balance of power game is to create a US-led structure to balance the relationship between global powers. Essentially it is not about trying to cooperate with the other side, but to ensure that the US can suppress and dismantle the other side in order to achieve US hegemony. Such a balancing structure will eventually force many small and medium-sized countries to choose sides. The crisis in Ukraine, which has gone so far, is a typical example.However, after China's peaceful rise, such a balancing strategy has become increasingly difficult to achieve. China and the US have become increasingly interdependent over the course of the past 50 years, and it is clear that their relationship is no longer tempered by equilibrium. Any forces that US would like to leverage to reorganize the so-called balance will hardly stop China's continued development.Fifty years ago, the US-China relationship made a breakthrough because of the US balancing strategy, and now, 50 years later, the relationship is beginning to ""decouple."" This is because, in US's balanced strategy, it has never seen itself as a party that can be on an equal footing with its so-called rivals, but always calculating how to prevent other countries from challenging its hegemonic position.The author is a senior editor with People's Daily, and currently a senior fellow with the Chongyang Institute for Financial Studies at Renmin University of China. dinggang@globaltimes.com.cn.

233,"All sides should give Russia, Ukraine some space to resolve issue: Global Times editorial",Global Times,2022-02-23,"Russia President Vladimir Putin on Monday signed two decrees recognizing ""the Lugansk (LPR)"" and ""the Donetsk (DPR)"" as independent and sovereign states. Ukraine decided to recall its charge d'affairs in Russia and will reconsider its diplomatic relations with Russia. The sudden change in the Ukraine situation has aroused great concern around the world. In this regard, China State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi said on Tuesday that the legitimate security concerns of any country must be respected, and the purposes and principles of the UN Charter must be upheld. He said China once again called on all parties to exercise restraint, appreciate the importance of implementing the principle of indivisible security, and de-escalate the situation and resolve differences through dialogue and negotiations.It should be noted that it is very regrettable that the Ukraine issue has evolved so far. The US has continued its intensive containment on Russia, which finally forced Russia to try to realize its security demands in such a way. This is the outburst of the dissatisfaction of the party whose security demands have been ignored for a long time since the end of the Cold War. The situation in Ukraine is deteriorating. At this time, the international community cannot discard its efforts for peace and to avoid further escalating the situation.The prospect of the situation between Russia and Ukraine remains highly uncertain. The US and West countries immediately condemned Russia's move. The White House officials said further ""coordinated"" sanctions directed at Russia would be announced on Tuesday. UN Secretary-General António Guterres said Russia's decision is ""a violation of the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Ukraine and inconsistent with the principles of the Charter of the UN."" He called for addressing ""all issues peacefully."" Many countries said they should not give up diplomatic means to peacefully solve the problem and underlined that ""constructive diplomacy is the need of the hour.""The Russia-Ukraine crisis is a dual crisis, in which bilateral conflicts between Russia and Ukraine are intertwined with the strategic suppression that NATO's eastward expansion has brought to Russia. All relevant parties have put forward their own security demands before. Although no consensus was reached, that doesn't necessarily mean a complete breakup of negotiations. It hasn't reached the point that the issue must be solved by war. Whether the situation will further escalate next mainly depends on the scale of the US sanctions imposed on Russia and whether Russia will be provoked to take more aggressive measures.Peace and no war is in the biggest and common interests of all countries in the EU continent. In this sense, only by achieving a soft landing for the Russia-Ukraine crisis can EU realize peace. True security should be inalienable, common, integrated, cooperative and sustainable. This means all sides' security interests should be respected and safeguarded, and if any party's security concerns are ignored or even trampled on, geopolitical disputes will continue and never cease. The knot must be untied by the one who tied it. Russia and Ukraine need to have face-to-face dialogues. The US and NATO should be pulled back from the Russia-Ukraine crisis as much as possible and there should be no more complicated elements added to influence the situation.In particular, at a time when the situation is uncertain, all sides should leave some space for Russia and Ukraine to solve the problems. Confrontation, sanctions, or even a direct battle will not help ease tensions. The flames scattered in eastern Ukraine are reminding all parties of the fact that blindly imposing pressure will only lead to an escalation of conflicts. What is most needed there are restraints and rationality, as well as constructive efforts of the international community.   China has no self-interest in the Ukraine issue. It has always upheld a fair and responsible attitude and will decide its own position based on the merits of the matter itself. Although all parties have different views on the Ukraine crisis, the top priority now is to avoid any actions that could intensify tensions. The international community should reach such a consensus as soon as possible. The development of the Ukraine situation is the result of a series of complex factors. Now that it has come to the brink of a cliff, all parties should work together to pull it back.",OPINION,EDITORIAL,"United Nations Security Council meets after Russia recognized two breakaway regions in eastern Ukraine as independent entities, in New York City on Monday.

237,"EU agrees Russia sanctions package, warns of further action",Xinhua,2022-02-23," The EU (EU) is ready to take further action against Russia if it continues to escalate the crisis, EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen warned here on Tuesday.In a statement, von der Leyen said EU member states had given their political consent to a new package of sanctions against Russia following its recognition of the independence of the Ukraine regions of Donetsk and Luhansk.The package contains a number of ""calibrated measures"" targeting banks that finance the Russia military apparatus and contribute to the destabilization of Ukraine.It also bans trade between the two breakaway regions and the EU, as it did with Crimea in 2014, and limits the Russia government's ability to raise capital on the EU's financial markets.Russia President Vladimir Putin on Monday evening signed decrees recognizing the independence of two self-proclaimed regions in eastern Ukraine's Donbass as ""the Lugansk (LPR)"" and ""the Donetsk (DPR).""Russia has done everything to preserve the territorial integrity of Ukraine by fighting for the implementation of 2015 Minsk agreement, but all the efforts ended up in vain, Vladimir Putin said on Monday.The security crisis occurred due to NATO's eastward expansion, which has led to the loss of mutual trust with Russia, he noted.According to Josep Borrell, EU's High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, the package comprises sanctions against 351 members of the Russia State Duma (lower house of the country's Federal Assembly) who voted to recognize the two regions.The EU will also ""target 27 individuals and entities who are playing a role in undermining or threatening Ukraine's territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence,"" he said.Furthermore, the sanctions aim to target the Russia state's ability to access the EU's capital and financial markets and services.""If Russia continues to escalate this crisis that it has created, we are ready to take further action in response,"" von der Leyen said.On the controversial Russia-Germany Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, von der Leyen said she believed that the Germany government was ""absolutely right"" to stop the project, which must be assessed in light of the security of energy supply for all of EU.""This crisis shows that EU is still too dependent on Russia gas. We have to diversify our suppliers and massively invest in renewables. This is a strategic investment in our energy independence,"" she said.The conflict in eastern Ukraine began in April 2014 with fightings between the Ukraine government troops and local armed groups who seized several towns.With the mediation of the global community, the two sides in Belarus' capital of Minsk reached ceasefire agreements in September 2014 and February 2015 respectively.Russia has been seeking NATO's guarantee to halt eastward expansion. However, U.S. President Joe Biden's administration took a hard line against Russia, supporting Ukraine's efforts to join the U.S.-led military alliance and increasing its military assistance to Ukraine, which has re-escalated tensions in the region.The situation in eastern Ukraine has been getting worse since Feb. 17, as the Ukraine government and local armed groups blamed each other for launching aggressive bombards.",WORLD,EUROPE,"European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen makes a statement on the Ukraine issue in Brussels, Belgium, on Feb. 22, 2022.

Ukraine refused to recognize their self-proclaimed status.Calling Russia's move ""the beginning of a Russia invasion of Ukraine,"" Joe Biden said in remarks delivered from the White House that his administration will impose sanctions on two Russia financial institutions - the VEB and the country's military bank -- as well as on Russia's sovereign debt and three individuals.He explained that the measure ""means we've cut off Russia's government from West financing.

241,"US hardly leads the West out of helplessness, but is in fact the cause",Zhao Minghao,2022-02-23,"The Munich Security Conference 2022 was held under the shadow of multiple challenges including the Ukraine crisis. The Munich Security Index 2022 shows perceptions of risk that pervade the societies of G7 countries due to COVID-19 pandemic, geopolitical tensions, domestic political polarization, and rising inequality. As the Munich Security Report 2022 points out, many West people believe that they are living in a ""new era of successive and interconnected disruptions,"" and there is a growing ""collective helplessness.""Such helplessness comes from domestic political dysfunction. Economic inequality, ethnic tensions, and intergenerational conflicts are old problems that become even worse in a polarized political environment. The stagnation of political reforms has largely contributed to ""crisis fatigue"" within the G7 countries mentioned in the Munich Security Report 2022. People feel less confident in their governments. According to a recent NBC News poll, only 22 percent answered that things are ""headed in the right direction.""The trend toward the retreat of democracy continues, warned Wolfgang Ischinger, chairman of the Munich Security Conference. The ""illiberal movement"" within the West is worsening, and there are challenges like populism and neo-fascism. US leadership in the West has been damaged due to its domestic illiberal movement. During the Joe Biden presidency, the US is more divided under the crisis of democracy. Helplessness stems from the external challenges West countries face, which are often self-imposed. NATO enlargement and the EU's expansion eastward are the key factors influencing Russia's strong responses to the Ukraine crisis, according to John Mearsheimer, professor at the University of Chicago. He pointed out that the Ukraine crisis is the West's fault as the West had been moving into Russia's backyard and threatening its core strategic interests. Indeed, Ukraine has the right to make a choice, but that choice should not expose its neighbor to a major security threat. Given the US and EU interference in Ukraine, it's hard to argue that Kiev's choice is truly ""independent."" Leaked classified documents show that senior US officials like Victoria Nuland, US' current under secretary of state for political affairs, have been weighing in on the make-up of the Ukraine government. For the US, the survival of NATO depends on deliberately created geopolitical tensions. The Obama administration's actions during the Russo-Georgian War and the Joe Biden administration's moves during the recent Ukraine crisis show to the world a rattled US government. ""Helpless"" EU must realize that there is indeed a geopolitical factor. Some EU countries, including Germany, seem to be interested in participating in the geopolitical game in the Indo-Pacific region, following US to provoke Beijing on the Taiwan question. This will bring them into trouble. Another contribution to the West's helplessness is the Afghanistan issue. With the hasty withdrawal of the US troops from Afghanistan, the humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan is getting worse because of the de facto US sanctions against the Taliban. The West does have a sense of frustration over Afghanistan, but it cannot be allowed to shrug off its responsibility in an immoral matter. The West is facing what former EU Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker called a ""polycrisis."" The US is hardly leading the West out of helplessness, and is in fact the cause. As the Munich Security Report 2022 emphasizes, collectively, they have the chance to turn the tide. Individually they risk being swept away. EU needs to make efforts to this end, especially to persuade US not to indulge in confrontations with China and Russia. The author is a senior fellow at the Charhar Institute and China Forum Expert at Tsinghua University. opinion@globaltimes.com.cn",OPINION,VIEWPOINT,"Outgoing Munich Security Conference Chairman Wolfgang Ischinger speaks at the end of the Munich Security Conference (MSC) in Munich, southern Germany, on February 20, 2022.

242,Can US’ balancing strategy last after Ukraine crisis?,Ding Gang,2022-02-23,"On February 21, 1972, US President Richard Nixon came to Beijing to begin a ""world-changing"" visit. He became the first sitting US president to visit China.On February 28, China and the US issued the Shanghai Joint Communiqué, which laid the foundation for the subsequent development of US-China relations.Twenty years ago, in February 2002, I interviewed Dr Kissinger in New York. Over the past two days, I have gone over my notes from that interview and have been filled with emotion.The China-US relationship seems to have gone through a strange circle, from breaking the ice in 1972, to steadily rising to a warm point in 2002, and then beginning to freeze again.The world is also in the midst of dramatic change. From Chairman Mao Zedong's handshake with President Nixon, to former President Donald Trump's ""decoupling"" with, to China-Russia back-to-back partnership today, and the outbreak of the Ukraine crisis, great powers are beginning to reorganize.I clearly remember Dr Kissinger telling me at the time that the breakthrough in the Shanghai Communiqué was largely due to a mutual recognition that establishing direct contacts was possible and in the interest of both sides.Kissinger said President Nixon made the goal of establishing diplomatic relations with China an integral part of his international strategy as soon as he took office. The China side had the same consideration.According to Kissinger, there were also concerns on the China side at the time about the threat from the Soviet Union. Those were the two bases on which the Shanghai Communiqué made its breakthrough. The basic spirit of the communiqué, in his view, was to establish a direct cooperative relationship between the US and China.The two foundations Dr Kissinger spoke of reflect his idea of a balanced strategy. The central idea of his book World Order was that a balance of power based on the Peace of Westphalia was the key to avoiding war and building peace.This idea of strategic balance still influences US's global strategy today, and the adjustment of US policy toward China clearly comes from this idea.In recent years, some in US have insisted that the US-China relationship is headed for a breakdown because China has adopted a more aggressive strategy of foreign expansion, undermining the order that the US has worked on for years to establish in the Asia-Pacific region and is upsetting the global balance of power.Some US scholars also cited Kissinger's advice before Nixon's visit to China 50 years ago.According to declassified documents, Kissinger told Nixon at the time that the US should ""play the balance of power game without any emotion.""Kissinger also predicted that in 20 years, China would be ""even more powerful"" and reminded the US president at that time to consider how to rely on Russia to keep China down.Such a balance of power game is to create a US-led structure to balance the relationship between global powers. Essentially it is not about trying to cooperate with the other side, but to ensure that the US can suppress and dismantle the other side in order to achieve US hegemony. Such a balancing structure will eventually force many small and medium-sized countries to choose sides. The crisis in Ukraine, which has gone so far, is a typical example.However, after China's peaceful rise, such a balancing strategy has become increasingly difficult to achieve. China and the US have become increasingly interdependent over the course of the past 50 years, and it is clear that their relationship is no longer tempered by equilibrium. Any forces that US would like to leverage to reorganize the so-called balance will hardly stop China's continued development.Fifty years ago, the US-China relationship made a breakthrough because of the US balancing strategy, and now, 50 years later, the relationship is beginning to ""decouple."" This is because, in US's balanced strategy, it has never seen itself as a party that can be on an equal footing with its so-called rivals, but always calculating how to prevent other countries from challenging its hegemonic position.The author is a senior editor with People's Daily, and currently a senior fellow with the Chongyang Institute for Financial Studies at Renmin University of China. dinggang@globaltimes.com.cn.

243,"All sides should give Russia, Ukraine some space to resolve issue: Global Times editorial",Global Times,2022-02-23,"Russia President Vladimir Putin on Monday signed two decrees recognizing ""the Lugansk (LPR)"" and ""the Donetsk (DPR)"" as independent and sovereign states. Ukraine decided to recall its charge d'affairs in Russia and will reconsider its diplomatic relations with Russia. The sudden change in the Ukraine situation has aroused great concern around the world. In this regard, China State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi said on Tuesday that the legitimate security concerns of any country must be respected, and the purposes and principles of the UN Charter must be upheld. He said China once again called on all parties to exercise restraint, appreciate the importance of implementing the principle of indivisible security, and de-escalate the situation and resolve differences through dialogue and negotiations.It should be noted that it is very regrettable that the Ukraine issue has evolved so far. The US has continued its intensive containment on Russia, which finally forced Russia to try to realize its security demands in such a way. This is the outburst of the dissatisfaction of the party whose security demands have been ignored for a long time since the end of the Cold War. The situation in Ukraine is deteriorating. At this time, the international community cannot discard its efforts for peace and to avoid further escalating the situation.The prospect of the situation between Russia and Ukraine remains highly uncertain. The US and West countries immediately condemned Russia's move. The White House officials said further ""coordinated"" sanctions directed at Russia would be announced on Tuesday. UN Secretary-General António Guterres said Russia's decision is ""a violation of the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Ukraine and inconsistent with the principles of the Charter of the UN."" He called for addressing ""all issues peacefully."" Many countries said they should not give up diplomatic means to peacefully solve the problem and underlined that ""constructive diplomacy is the need of the hour.""The Russia-Ukraine crisis is a dual crisis, in which bilateral conflicts between Russia and Ukraine are intertwined with the strategic suppression that NATO's eastward expansion has brought to Russia. All relevant parties have put forward their own security demands before. Although no consensus was reached, that doesn't necessarily mean a complete breakup of negotiations. It hasn't reached the point that the issue must be solved by war. Whether the situation will further escalate next mainly depends on the scale of the US sanctions imposed on Russia and whether Russia will be provoked to take more aggressive measures.Peace and no war is in the biggest and common interests of all countries in the EU continent. In this sense, only by achieving a soft landing for the Russia-Ukraine crisis can EU realize peace. True security should be inalienable, common, integrated, cooperative and sustainable. This means all sides' security interests should be respected and safeguarded, and if any party's security concerns are ignored or even trampled on, geopolitical disputes will continue and never cease. The knot must be untied by the one who tied it. Russia and Ukraine need to have face-to-face dialogues. The US and NATO should be pulled back from the Russia-Ukraine crisis as much as possible and there should be no more complicated elements added to influence the situation.In particular, at a time when the situation is uncertain, all sides should leave some space for Russia and Ukraine to solve the problems. Confrontation, sanctions, or even a direct battle will not help ease tensions. The flames scattered in eastern Ukraine are reminding all parties of the fact that blindly imposing pressure will only lead to an escalation of conflicts. What is most needed there are restraints and rationality, as well as constructive efforts of the international community.   China has no self-interest in the Ukraine issue. It has always upheld a fair and responsible attitude and will decide its own position based on the merits of the matter itself. Although all parties have different views on the Ukraine crisis, the top priority now is to avoid any actions that could intensify tensions. The international community should reach such a consensus as soon as possible. The development of the Ukraine situation is the result of a series of complex factors. Now that it has come to the brink of a cliff, all parties should work together to pull it back.",OPINION,EDITORIAL,"United Nations Security Council meets after Russia recognized two breakaway regions in eastern Ukraine as independent entities, in New York City on Monday.

247,"EU agrees Russia sanctions package, warns of further action",Xinhua,2022-02-23," The EU (EU) is ready to take further action against Russia if it continues to escalate the crisis, EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen warned here on Tuesday.In a statement, von der Leyen said EU member states had given their political consent to a new package of sanctions against Russia following its recognition of the independence of the Ukraine regions of Donetsk and Luhansk.The package contains a number of ""calibrated measures"" targeting banks that finance the Russia military apparatus and contribute to the destabilization of Ukraine.It also bans trade between the two breakaway regions and the EU, as it did with Crimea in 2014, and limits the Russia government's ability to raise capital on the EU's financial markets.Russia President Vladimir Putin on Monday evening signed decrees recognizing the independence of two self-proclaimed regions in eastern Ukraine's Donbass as ""the Lugansk (LPR)"" and ""the Donetsk (DPR).""Russia has done everything to preserve the territorial integrity of Ukraine by fighting for the implementation of 2015 Minsk agreement, but all the efforts ended up in vain, Vladimir Putin said on Monday.The security crisis occurred due to NATO's eastward expansion, which has led to the loss of mutual trust with Russia, he noted.According to Josep Borrell, EU's High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, the package comprises sanctions against 351 members of the Russia State Duma (lower house of the country's Federal Assembly) who voted to recognize the two regions.The EU will also ""target 27 individuals and entities who are playing a role in undermining or threatening Ukraine's territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence,"" he said.Furthermore, the sanctions aim to target the Russia state's ability to access the EU's capital and financial markets and services.""If Russia continues to escalate this crisis that it has created, we are ready to take further action in response,"" von der Leyen said.On the controversial Russia-Germany Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, von der Leyen said she believed that the Germany government was ""absolutely right"" to stop the project, which must be assessed in light of the security of energy supply for all of EU.""This crisis shows that EU is still too dependent on Russia gas. We have to diversify our suppliers and massively invest in renewables. This is a strategic investment in our energy independence,"" she said.The conflict in eastern Ukraine began in April 2014 with fightings between the Ukraine government troops and local armed groups who seized several towns.With the mediation of the global community, the two sides in Belarus' capital of Minsk reached ceasefire agreements in September 2014 and February 2015 respectively.Russia has been seeking NATO's guarantee to halt eastward expansion. However, U.S. President Joe Biden's administration took a hard line against Russia, supporting Ukraine's efforts to join the U.S.-led military alliance and increasing its military assistance to Ukraine, which has re-escalated tensions in the region.The situation in eastern Ukraine has been getting worse since Feb. 17, as the Ukraine government and local armed groups blamed each other for launching aggressive bombards.",WORLD,EUROPE,"European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen makes a statement on the Ukraine issue in Brussels, Belgium, on Feb. 22, 2022.

Ukraine refused to recognize their self-proclaimed status.Calling Russia's move ""the beginning of a Russia invasion of Ukraine,"" Joe Biden said in remarks delivered from the White House that his administration will impose sanctions on two Russia financial institutions - the VEB and the country's military bank -- as well as on Russia's sovereign debt and three individuals.He explained that the measure ""means we've cut off Russia's government from West financing.

251,"US hardly leads the West out of helplessness, but is in fact the cause",Zhao Minghao,2022-02-23,"The Munich Security Conference 2022 was held under the shadow of multiple challenges including the Ukraine crisis. The Munich Security Index 2022 shows perceptions of risk that pervade the societies of G7 countries due to COVID-19 pandemic, geopolitical tensions, domestic political polarization, and rising inequality. As the Munich Security Report 2022 points out, many West people believe that they are living in a ""new era of successive and interconnected disruptions,"" and there is a growing ""collective helplessness.""Such helplessness comes from domestic political dysfunction. Economic inequality, ethnic tensions, and intergenerational conflicts are old problems that become even worse in a polarized political environment. The stagnation of political reforms has largely contributed to ""crisis fatigue"" within the G7 countries mentioned in the Munich Security Report 2022. People feel less confident in their governments. According to a recent NBC News poll, only 22 percent answered that things are ""headed in the right direction.""The trend toward the retreat of democracy continues, warned Wolfgang Ischinger, chairman of the Munich Security Conference. The ""illiberal movement"" within the West is worsening, and there are challenges like populism and neo-fascism. US leadership in the West has been damaged due to its domestic illiberal movement. During the Joe Biden presidency, the US is more divided under the crisis of democracy. Helplessness stems from the external challenges West countries face, which are often self-imposed. NATO enlargement and the EU's expansion eastward are the key factors influencing Russia's strong responses to the Ukraine crisis, according to John Mearsheimer, professor at the University of Chicago. He pointed out that the Ukraine crisis is the West's fault as the West had been moving into Russia's backyard and threatening its core strategic interests. Indeed, Ukraine has the right to make a choice, but that choice should not expose its neighbor to a major security threat. Given the US and EU interference in Ukraine, it's hard to argue that Kiev's choice is truly ""independent."" Leaked classified documents show that senior US officials like Victoria Nuland, US' current under secretary of state for political affairs, have been weighing in on the make-up of the Ukraine government. For the US, the survival of NATO depends on deliberately created geopolitical tensions. The Obama administration's actions during the Russo-Georgian War and the Joe Biden administration's moves during the recent Ukraine crisis show to the world a rattled US government. ""Helpless"" EU must realize that there is indeed a geopolitical factor. Some EU countries, including Germany, seem to be interested in participating in the geopolitical game in the Indo-Pacific region, following US to provoke Beijing on the Taiwan question. This will bring them into trouble. Another contribution to the West's helplessness is the Afghanistan issue. With the hasty withdrawal of the US troops from Afghanistan, the humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan is getting worse because of the de facto US sanctions against the Taliban. The West does have a sense of frustration over Afghanistan, but it cannot be allowed to shrug off its responsibility in an immoral matter. The West is facing what former EU Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker called a ""polycrisis."" The US is hardly leading the West out of helplessness, and is in fact the cause. As the Munich Security Report 2022 emphasizes, collectively, they have the chance to turn the tide. Individually they risk being swept away. EU needs to make efforts to this end, especially to persuade US not to indulge in confrontations with China and Russia. The author is a senior fellow at the Charhar Institute and China Forum Expert at Tsinghua University. opinion@globaltimes.com.cn",OPINION,VIEWPOINT,"Outgoing Munich Security Conference Chairman Wolfgang Ischinger speaks at the end of the Munich Security Conference (MSC) in Munich, southern Germany, on February 20, 2022.

252,Can US’ balancing strategy last after Ukraine crisis?,Ding Gang,2022-02-23,"On February 21, 1972, US President Richard Nixon came to Beijing to begin a ""world-changing"" visit. He became the first sitting US president to visit China.On February 28, China and the US issued the Shanghai Joint Communiqué, which laid the foundation for the subsequent development of US-China relations.Twenty years ago, in February 2002, I interviewed Dr Kissinger in New York. Over the past two days, I have gone over my notes from that interview and have been filled with emotion.The China-US relationship seems to have gone through a strange circle, from breaking the ice in 1972, to steadily rising to a warm point in 2002, and then beginning to freeze again.The world is also in the midst of dramatic change. From Chairman Mao Zedong's handshake with President Nixon, to former President Donald Trump's ""decoupling"" with, to China-Russia back-to-back partnership today, and the outbreak of the Ukraine crisis, great powers are beginning to reorganize.I clearly remember Dr Kissinger telling me at the time that the breakthrough in the Shanghai Communiqué was largely due to a mutual recognition that establishing direct contacts was possible and in the interest of both sides.Kissinger said President Nixon made the goal of establishing diplomatic relations with China an integral part of his international strategy as soon as he took office. The China side had the same consideration.According to Kissinger, there were also concerns on the China side at the time about the threat from the Soviet Union. Those were the two bases on which the Shanghai Communiqué made its breakthrough. The basic spirit of the communiqué, in his view, was to establish a direct cooperative relationship between the US and China.The two foundations Dr Kissinger spoke of reflect his idea of a balanced strategy. The central idea of his book World Order was that a balance of power based on the Peace of Westphalia was the key to avoiding war and building peace.This idea of strategic balance still influences US's global strategy today, and the adjustment of US policy toward China clearly comes from this idea.In recent years, some in US have insisted that the US-China relationship is headed for a breakdown because China has adopted a more aggressive strategy of foreign expansion, undermining the order that the US has worked on for years to establish in the Asia-Pacific region and is upsetting the global balance of power.Some US scholars also cited Kissinger's advice before Nixon's visit to China 50 years ago.According to declassified documents, Kissinger told Nixon at the time that the US should ""play the balance of power game without any emotion.""Kissinger also predicted that in 20 years, China would be ""even more powerful"" and reminded the US president at that time to consider how to rely on Russia to keep China down.Such a balance of power game is to create a US-led structure to balance the relationship between global powers. Essentially it is not about trying to cooperate with the other side, but to ensure that the US can suppress and dismantle the other side in order to achieve US hegemony. Such a balancing structure will eventually force many small and medium-sized countries to choose sides. The crisis in Ukraine, which has gone so far, is a typical example.However, after China's peaceful rise, such a balancing strategy has become increasingly difficult to achieve. China and the US have become increasingly interdependent over the course of the past 50 years, and it is clear that their relationship is no longer tempered by equilibrium. Any forces that US would like to leverage to reorganize the so-called balance will hardly stop China's continued development.Fifty years ago, the US-China relationship made a breakthrough because of the US balancing strategy, and now, 50 years later, the relationship is beginning to ""decouple."" This is because, in US's balanced strategy, it has never seen itself as a party that can be on an equal footing with its so-called rivals, but always calculating how to prevent other countries from challenging its hegemonic position.The author is a senior editor with People's Daily, and currently a senior fellow with the Chongyang Institute for Financial Studies at Renmin University of China. dinggang@globaltimes.com.cn.

253,"All sides should give Russia, Ukraine some space to resolve issue: Global Times editorial",Global Times,2022-02-23,"Russia President Vladimir Putin on Monday signed two decrees recognizing ""the Lugansk (LPR)"" and ""the Donetsk (DPR)"" as independent and sovereign states. Ukraine decided to recall its charge d'affairs in Russia and will reconsider its diplomatic relations with Russia. The sudden change in the Ukraine situation has aroused great concern around the world. In this regard, China State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi said on Tuesday that the legitimate security concerns of any country must be respected, and the purposes and principles of the UN Charter must be upheld. He said China once again called on all parties to exercise restraint, appreciate the importance of implementing the principle of indivisible security, and de-escalate the situation and resolve differences through dialogue and negotiations.It should be noted that it is very regrettable that the Ukraine issue has evolved so far. The US has continued its intensive containment on Russia, which finally forced Russia to try to realize its security demands in such a way. This is the outburst of the dissatisfaction of the party whose security demands have been ignored for a long time since the end of the Cold War. The situation in Ukraine is deteriorating. At this time, the international community cannot discard its efforts for peace and to avoid further escalating the situation.The prospect of the situation between Russia and Ukraine remains highly uncertain. The US and West countries immediately condemned Russia's move. The White House officials said further ""coordinated"" sanctions directed at Russia would be announced on Tuesday. UN Secretary-General António Guterres said Russia's decision is ""a violation of the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Ukraine and inconsistent with the principles of the Charter of the UN."" He called for addressing ""all issues peacefully."" Many countries said they should not give up diplomatic means to peacefully solve the problem and underlined that ""constructive diplomacy is the need of the hour.""The Russia-Ukraine crisis is a dual crisis, in which bilateral conflicts between Russia and Ukraine are intertwined with the strategic suppression that NATO's eastward expansion has brought to Russia. All relevant parties have put forward their own security demands before. Although no consensus was reached, that doesn't necessarily mean a complete breakup of negotiations. It hasn't reached the point that the issue must be solved by war. Whether the situation will further escalate next mainly depends on the scale of the US sanctions imposed on Russia and whether Russia will be provoked to take more aggressive measures.Peace and no war is in the biggest and common interests of all countries in the EU continent. In this sense, only by achieving a soft landing for the Russia-Ukraine crisis can EU realize peace. True security should be inalienable, common, integrated, cooperative and sustainable. This means all sides' security interests should be respected and safeguarded, and if any party's security concerns are ignored or even trampled on, geopolitical disputes will continue and never cease. The knot must be untied by the one who tied it. Russia and Ukraine need to have face-to-face dialogues. The US and NATO should be pulled back from the Russia-Ukraine crisis as much as possible and there should be no more complicated elements added to influence the situation.In particular, at a time when the situation is uncertain, all sides should leave some space for Russia and Ukraine to solve the problems. Confrontation, sanctions, or even a direct battle will not help ease tensions. The flames scattered in eastern Ukraine are reminding all parties of the fact that blindly imposing pressure will only lead to an escalation of conflicts. What is most needed there are restraints and rationality, as well as constructive efforts of the international community.   China has no self-interest in the Ukraine issue. It has always upheld a fair and responsible attitude and will decide its own position based on the merits of the matter itself. Although all parties have different views on the Ukraine crisis, the top priority now is to avoid any actions that could intensify tensions. The international community should reach such a consensus as soon as possible. The development of the Ukraine situation is the result of a series of complex factors. Now that it has come to the brink of a cliff, all parties should work together to pull it back.",OPINION,EDITORIAL,"United Nations Security Council meets after Russia recognized two breakaway regions in eastern Ukraine as independent entities, in New York City on Monday.

257,"EU agrees Russia sanctions package, warns of further action",Xinhua,2022-02-23," The EU (EU) is ready to take further action against Russia if it continues to escalate the crisis, EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen warned here on Tuesday.In a statement, von der Leyen said EU member states had given their political consent to a new package of sanctions against Russia following its recognition of the independence of the Ukraine regions of Donetsk and Luhansk.The package contains a number of ""calibrated measures"" targeting banks that finance the Russia military apparatus and contribute to the destabilization of Ukraine.It also bans trade between the two breakaway regions and the EU, as it did with Crimea in 2014, and limits the Russia government's ability to raise capital on the EU's financial markets.Russia President Vladimir Putin on Monday evening signed decrees recognizing the independence of two self-proclaimed regions in eastern Ukraine's Donbass as ""the Lugansk (LPR)"" and ""the Donetsk (DPR).""Russia has done everything to preserve the territorial integrity of Ukraine by fighting for the implementation of 2015 Minsk agreement, but all the efforts ended up in vain, Vladimir Putin said on Monday.The security crisis occurred due to NATO's eastward expansion, which has led to the loss of mutual trust with Russia, he noted.According to Josep Borrell, EU's High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, the package comprises sanctions against 351 members of the Russia State Duma (lower house of the country's Federal Assembly) who voted to recognize the two regions.The EU will also ""target 27 individuals and entities who are playing a role in undermining or threatening Ukraine's territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence,"" he said.Furthermore, the sanctions aim to target the Russia state's ability to access the EU's capital and financial markets and services.""If Russia continues to escalate this crisis that it has created, we are ready to take further action in response,"" von der Leyen said.On the controversial Russia-Germany Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, von der Leyen said she believed that the Germany government was ""absolutely right"" to stop the project, which must be assessed in light of the security of energy supply for all of EU.""This crisis shows that EU is still too dependent on Russia gas. We have to diversify our suppliers and massively invest in renewables. This is a strategic investment in our energy independence,"" she said.The conflict in eastern Ukraine began in April 2014 with fightings between the Ukraine government troops and local armed groups who seized several towns.With the mediation of the global community, the two sides in Belarus' capital of Minsk reached ceasefire agreements in September 2014 and February 2015 respectively.Russia has been seeking NATO's guarantee to halt eastward expansion. However, U.S. President Joe Biden's administration took a hard line against Russia, supporting Ukraine's efforts to join the U.S.-led military alliance and increasing its military assistance to Ukraine, which has re-escalated tensions in the region.The situation in eastern Ukraine has been getting worse since Feb. 17, as the Ukraine government and local armed groups blamed each other for launching aggressive bombards.",WORLD,EUROPE,"European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen makes a statement on the Ukraine issue in Brussels, Belgium, on Feb. 22, 2022.

Ukraine refused to recognize their self-proclaimed status.Calling Russia's move ""the beginning of a Russia invasion of Ukraine,"" Joe Biden said in remarks delivered from the White House that his administration will impose sanctions on two Russia financial institutions - the VEB and the country's military bank -- as well as on Russia's sovereign debt and three individuals.He explained that the measure ""means we've cut off Russia's government from West financing.

261,"US hardly leads the West out of helplessness, but is in fact the cause",Zhao Minghao,2022-02-23,"The Munich Security Conference 2022 was held under the shadow of multiple challenges including the Ukraine crisis. The Munich Security Index 2022 shows perceptions of risk that pervade the societies of G7 countries due to COVID-19 pandemic, geopolitical tensions, domestic political polarization, and rising inequality. As the Munich Security Report 2022 points out, many West people believe that they are living in a ""new era of successive and interconnected disruptions,"" and there is a growing ""collective helplessness.""Such helplessness comes from domestic political dysfunction. Economic inequality, ethnic tensions, and intergenerational conflicts are old problems that become even worse in a polarized political environment. The stagnation of political reforms has largely contributed to ""crisis fatigue"" within the G7 countries mentioned in the Munich Security Report 2022. People feel less confident in their governments. According to a recent NBC News poll, only 22 percent answered that things are ""headed in the right direction.""The trend toward the retreat of democracy continues, warned Wolfgang Ischinger, chairman of the Munich Security Conference. The ""illiberal movement"" within the West is worsening, and there are challenges like populism and neo-fascism. US leadership in the West has been damaged due to its domestic illiberal movement. During the Joe Biden presidency, the US is more divided under the crisis of democracy. Helplessness stems from the external challenges West countries face, which are often self-imposed. NATO enlargement and the EU's expansion eastward are the key factors influencing Russia's strong responses to the Ukraine crisis, according to John Mearsheimer, professor at the University of Chicago. He pointed out that the Ukraine crisis is the West's fault as the West had been moving into Russia's backyard and threatening its core strategic interests. Indeed, Ukraine has the right to make a choice, but that choice should not expose its neighbor to a major security threat. Given the US and EU interference in Ukraine, it's hard to argue that Kiev's choice is truly ""independent."" Leaked classified documents show that senior US officials like Victoria Nuland, US' current under secretary of state for political affairs, have been weighing in on the make-up of the Ukraine government. For the US, the survival of NATO depends on deliberately created geopolitical tensions. The Obama administration's actions during the Russo-Georgian War and the Joe Biden administration's moves during the recent Ukraine crisis show to the world a rattled US government. ""Helpless"" EU must realize that there is indeed a geopolitical factor. Some EU countries, including Germany, seem to be interested in participating in the geopolitical game in the Indo-Pacific region, following US to provoke Beijing on the Taiwan question. This will bring them into trouble. Another contribution to the West's helplessness is the Afghanistan issue. With the hasty withdrawal of the US troops from Afghanistan, the humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan is getting worse because of the de facto US sanctions against the Taliban. The West does have a sense of frustration over Afghanistan, but it cannot be allowed to shrug off its responsibility in an immoral matter. The West is facing what former EU Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker called a ""polycrisis."" The US is hardly leading the West out of helplessness, and is in fact the cause. As the Munich Security Report 2022 emphasizes, collectively, they have the chance to turn the tide. Individually they risk being swept away. EU needs to make efforts to this end, especially to persuade US not to indulge in confrontations with China and Russia. The author is a senior fellow at the Charhar Institute and China Forum Expert at Tsinghua University. opinion@globaltimes.com.cn",OPINION,VIEWPOINT,"Outgoing Munich Security Conference Chairman Wolfgang Ischinger speaks at the end of the Munich Security Conference (MSC) in Munich, southern Germany, on February 20, 2022.

262,Can US’ balancing strategy last after Ukraine crisis?,Ding Gang,2022-02-23,"On February 21, 1972, US President Richard Nixon came to Beijing to begin a ""world-changing"" visit. He became the first sitting US president to visit China.On February 28, China and the US issued the Shanghai Joint Communiqué, which laid the foundation for the subsequent development of US-China relations.Twenty years ago, in February 2002, I interviewed Dr Kissinger in New York. Over the past two days, I have gone over my notes from that interview and have been filled with emotion.The China-US relationship seems to have gone through a strange circle, from breaking the ice in 1972, to steadily rising to a warm point in 2002, and then beginning to freeze again.The world is also in the midst of dramatic change. From Chairman Mao Zedong's handshake with President Nixon, to former President Donald Trump's ""decoupling"" with, to China-Russia back-to-back partnership today, and the outbreak of the Ukraine crisis, great powers are beginning to reorganize.I clearly remember Dr Kissinger telling me at the time that the breakthrough in the Shanghai Communiqué was largely due to a mutual recognition that establishing direct contacts was possible and in the interest of both sides.Kissinger said President Nixon made the goal of establishing diplomatic relations with China an integral part of his international strategy as soon as he took office. The China side had the same consideration.According to Kissinger, there were also concerns on the China side at the time about the threat from the Soviet Union. Those were the two bases on which the Shanghai Communiqué made its breakthrough. The basic spirit of the communiqué, in his view, was to establish a direct cooperative relationship between the US and China.The two foundations Dr Kissinger spoke of reflect his idea of a balanced strategy. The central idea of his book World Order was that a balance of power based on the Peace of Westphalia was the key to avoiding war and building peace.This idea of strategic balance still influences US's global strategy today, and the adjustment of US policy toward China clearly comes from this idea.In recent years, some in US have insisted that the US-China relationship is headed for a breakdown because China has adopted a more aggressive strategy of foreign expansion, undermining the order that the US has worked on for years to establish in the Asia-Pacific region and is upsetting the global balance of power.Some US scholars also cited Kissinger's advice before Nixon's visit to China 50 years ago.According to declassified documents, Kissinger told Nixon at the time that the US should ""play the balance of power game without any emotion.""Kissinger also predicted that in 20 years, China would be ""even more powerful"" and reminded the US president at that time to consider how to rely on Russia to keep China down.Such a balance of power game is to create a US-led structure to balance the relationship between global powers. Essentially it is not about trying to cooperate with the other side, but to ensure that the US can suppress and dismantle the other side in order to achieve US hegemony. Such a balancing structure will eventually force many small and medium-sized countries to choose sides. The crisis in Ukraine, which has gone so far, is a typical example.However, after China's peaceful rise, such a balancing strategy has become increasingly difficult to achieve. China and the US have become increasingly interdependent over the course of the past 50 years, and it is clear that their relationship is no longer tempered by equilibrium. Any forces that US would like to leverage to reorganize the so-called balance will hardly stop China's continued development.Fifty years ago, the US-China relationship made a breakthrough because of the US balancing strategy, and now, 50 years later, the relationship is beginning to ""decouple."" This is because, in US's balanced strategy, it has never seen itself as a party that can be on an equal footing with its so-called rivals, but always calculating how to prevent other countries from challenging its hegemonic position.The author is a senior editor with People's Daily, and currently a senior fellow with the Chongyang Institute for Financial Studies at Renmin University of China. dinggang@globaltimes.com.cn.

263,"All sides should give Russia, Ukraine some space to resolve issue: Global Times editorial",Global Times,2022-02-23,"Russia President Vladimir Putin on Monday signed two decrees recognizing ""the Lugansk (LPR)"" and ""the Donetsk (DPR)"" as independent and sovereign states. Ukraine decided to recall its charge d'affairs in Russia and will reconsider its diplomatic relations with Russia. The sudden change in the Ukraine situation has aroused great concern around the world. In this regard, China State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi said on Tuesday that the legitimate security concerns of any country must be respected, and the purposes and principles of the UN Charter must be upheld. He said China once again called on all parties to exercise restraint, appreciate the importance of implementing the principle of indivisible security, and de-escalate the situation and resolve differences through dialogue and negotiations.It should be noted that it is very regrettable that the Ukraine issue has evolved so far. The US has continued its intensive containment on Russia, which finally forced Russia to try to realize its security demands in such a way. This is the outburst of the dissatisfaction of the party whose security demands have been ignored for a long time since the end of the Cold War. The situation in Ukraine is deteriorating. At this time, the international community cannot discard its efforts for peace and to avoid further escalating the situation.The prospect of the situation between Russia and Ukraine remains highly uncertain. The US and West countries immediately condemned Russia's move. The White House officials said further ""coordinated"" sanctions directed at Russia would be announced on Tuesday. UN Secretary-General António Guterres said Russia's decision is ""a violation of the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Ukraine and inconsistent with the principles of the Charter of the UN."" He called for addressing ""all issues peacefully."" Many countries said they should not give up diplomatic means to peacefully solve the problem and underlined that ""constructive diplomacy is the need of the hour.""The Russia-Ukraine crisis is a dual crisis, in which bilateral conflicts between Russia and Ukraine are intertwined with the strategic suppression that NATO's eastward expansion has brought to Russia. All relevant parties have put forward their own security demands before. Although no consensus was reached, that doesn't necessarily mean a complete breakup of negotiations. It hasn't reached the point that the issue must be solved by war. Whether the situation will further escalate next mainly depends on the scale of the US sanctions imposed on Russia and whether Russia will be provoked to take more aggressive measures.Peace and no war is in the biggest and common interests of all countries in the EU continent. In this sense, only by achieving a soft landing for the Russia-Ukraine crisis can EU realize peace. True security should be inalienable, common, integrated, cooperative and sustainable. This means all sides' security interests should be respected and safeguarded, and if any party's security concerns are ignored or even trampled on, geopolitical disputes will continue and never cease. The knot must be untied by the one who tied it. Russia and Ukraine need to have face-to-face dialogues. The US and NATO should be pulled back from the Russia-Ukraine crisis as much as possible and there should be no more complicated elements added to influence the situation.In particular, at a time when the situation is uncertain, all sides should leave some space for Russia and Ukraine to solve the problems. Confrontation, sanctions, or even a direct battle will not help ease tensions. The flames scattered in eastern Ukraine are reminding all parties of the fact that blindly imposing pressure will only lead to an escalation of conflicts. What is most needed there are restraints and rationality, as well as constructive efforts of the international community.   China has no self-interest in the Ukraine issue. It has always upheld a fair and responsible attitude and will decide its own position based on the merits of the matter itself. Although all parties have different views on the Ukraine crisis, the top priority now is to avoid any actions that could intensify tensions. The international community should reach such a consensus as soon as possible. The development of the Ukraine situation is the result of a series of complex factors. Now that it has come to the brink of a cliff, all parties should work together to pull it back.",OPINION,EDITORIAL,"United Nations Security Council meets after Russia recognized two breakaway regions in eastern Ukraine as independent entities, in New York City on Monday.

267,"EU agrees Russia sanctions package, warns of further action",Xinhua,2022-02-23," The EU (EU) is ready to take further action against Russia if it continues to escalate the crisis, EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen warned here on Tuesday.In a statement, von der Leyen said EU member states had given their political consent to a new package of sanctions against Russia following its recognition of the independence of the Ukraine regions of Donetsk and Luhansk.The package contains a number of ""calibrated measures"" targeting banks that finance the Russia military apparatus and contribute to the destabilization of Ukraine.It also bans trade between the two breakaway regions and the EU, as it did with Crimea in 2014, and limits the Russia government's ability to raise capital on the EU's financial markets.Russia President Vladimir Putin on Monday evening signed decrees recognizing the independence of two self-proclaimed regions in eastern Ukraine's Donbass as ""the Lugansk (LPR)"" and ""the Donetsk (DPR).""Russia has done everything to preserve the territorial integrity of Ukraine by fighting for the implementation of 2015 Minsk agreement, but all the efforts ended up in vain, Vladimir Putin said on Monday.The security crisis occurred due to NATO's eastward expansion, which has led to the loss of mutual trust with Russia, he noted.According to Josep Borrell, EU's High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, the package comprises sanctions against 351 members of the Russia State Duma (lower house of the country's Federal Assembly) who voted to recognize the two regions.The EU will also ""target 27 individuals and entities who are playing a role in undermining or threatening Ukraine's territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence,"" he said.Furthermore, the sanctions aim to target the Russia state's ability to access the EU's capital and financial markets and services.""If Russia continues to escalate this crisis that it has created, we are ready to take further action in response,"" von der Leyen said.On the controversial Russia-Germany Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, von der Leyen said she believed that the Germany government was ""absolutely right"" to stop the project, which must be assessed in light of the security of energy supply for all of EU.""This crisis shows that EU is still too dependent on Russia gas. We have to diversify our suppliers and massively invest in renewables. This is a strategic investment in our energy independence,"" she said.The conflict in eastern Ukraine began in April 2014 with fightings between the Ukraine government troops and local armed groups who seized several towns.With the mediation of the global community, the two sides in Belarus' capital of Minsk reached ceasefire agreements in September 2014 and February 2015 respectively.Russia has been seeking NATO's guarantee to halt eastward expansion. However, U.S. President Joe Biden's administration took a hard line against Russia, supporting Ukraine's efforts to join the U.S.-led military alliance and increasing its military assistance to Ukraine, which has re-escalated tensions in the region.The situation in eastern Ukraine has been getting worse since Feb. 17, as the Ukraine government and local armed groups blamed each other for launching aggressive bombards.",WORLD,EUROPE,"European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen makes a statement on the Ukraine issue in Brussels, Belgium, on Feb. 22, 2022.

Ukraine refused to recognize their self-proclaimed status.Calling Russia's move ""the beginning of a Russia invasion of Ukraine,"" Joe Biden said in remarks delivered from the White House that his administration will impose sanctions on two Russia financial institutions - the VEB and the country's military bank -- as well as on Russia's sovereign debt and three individuals.He explained that the measure ""means we've cut off Russia's government from West financing.

271,"US hardly leads the West out of helplessness, but is in fact the cause",Zhao Minghao,2022-02-23,"The Munich Security Conference 2022 was held under the shadow of multiple challenges including the Ukraine crisis. The Munich Security Index 2022 shows perceptions of risk that pervade the societies of G7 countries due to COVID-19 pandemic, geopolitical tensions, domestic political polarization, and rising inequality. As the Munich Security Report 2022 points out, many West people believe that they are living in a ""new era of successive and interconnected disruptions,"" and there is a growing ""collective helplessness.""Such helplessness comes from domestic political dysfunction. Economic inequality, ethnic tensions, and intergenerational conflicts are old problems that become even worse in a polarized political environment. The stagnation of political reforms has largely contributed to ""crisis fatigue"" within the G7 countries mentioned in the Munich Security Report 2022. People feel less confident in their governments. According to a recent NBC News poll, only 22 percent answered that things are ""headed in the right direction.""The trend toward the retreat of democracy continues, warned Wolfgang Ischinger, chairman of the Munich Security Conference. The ""illiberal movement"" within the West is worsening, and there are challenges like populism and neo-fascism. US leadership in the West has been damaged due to its domestic illiberal movement. During the Joe Biden presidency, the US is more divided under the crisis of democracy. Helplessness stems from the external challenges West countries face, which are often self-imposed. NATO enlargement and the EU's expansion eastward are the key factors influencing Russia's strong responses to the Ukraine crisis, according to John Mearsheimer, professor at the University of Chicago. He pointed out that the Ukraine crisis is the West's fault as the West had been moving into Russia's backyard and threatening its core strategic interests. Indeed, Ukraine has the right to make a choice, but that choice should not expose its neighbor to a major security threat. Given the US and EU interference in Ukraine, it's hard to argue that Kiev's choice is truly ""independent."" Leaked classified documents show that senior US officials like Victoria Nuland, US' current under secretary of state for political affairs, have been weighing in on the make-up of the Ukraine government. For the US, the survival of NATO depends on deliberately created geopolitical tensions. The Obama administration's actions during the Russo-Georgian War and the Joe Biden administration's moves during the recent Ukraine crisis show to the world a rattled US government. ""Helpless"" EU must realize that there is indeed a geopolitical factor. Some EU countries, including Germany, seem to be interested in participating in the geopolitical game in the Indo-Pacific region, following US to provoke Beijing on the Taiwan question. This will bring them into trouble. Another contribution to the West's helplessness is the Afghanistan issue. With the hasty withdrawal of the US troops from Afghanistan, the humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan is getting worse because of the de facto US sanctions against the Taliban. The West does have a sense of frustration over Afghanistan, but it cannot be allowed to shrug off its responsibility in an immoral matter. The West is facing what former EU Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker called a ""polycrisis."" The US is hardly leading the West out of helplessness, and is in fact the cause. As the Munich Security Report 2022 emphasizes, collectively, they have the chance to turn the tide. Individually they risk being swept away. EU needs to make efforts to this end, especially to persuade US not to indulge in confrontations with China and Russia. The author is a senior fellow at the Charhar Institute and China Forum Expert at Tsinghua University. opinion@globaltimes.com.cn",OPINION,VIEWPOINT,"Outgoing Munich Security Conference Chairman Wolfgang Ischinger speaks at the end of the Munich Security Conference (MSC) in Munich, southern Germany, on February 20, 2022.

272,Can US’ balancing strategy last after Ukraine crisis?,Ding Gang,2022-02-23,"On February 21, 1972, US President Richard Nixon came to Beijing to begin a ""world-changing"" visit. He became the first sitting US president to visit China.On February 28, China and the US issued the Shanghai Joint Communiqué, which laid the foundation for the subsequent development of US-China relations.Twenty years ago, in February 2002, I interviewed Dr Kissinger in New York. Over the past two days, I have gone over my notes from that interview and have been filled with emotion.The China-US relationship seems to have gone through a strange circle, from breaking the ice in 1972, to steadily rising to a warm point in 2002, and then beginning to freeze again.The world is also in the midst of dramatic change. From Chairman Mao Zedong's handshake with President Nixon, to former President Donald Trump's ""decoupling"" with, to China-Russia back-to-back partnership today, and the outbreak of the Ukraine crisis, great powers are beginning to reorganize.I clearly remember Dr Kissinger telling me at the time that the breakthrough in the Shanghai Communiqué was largely due to a mutual recognition that establishing direct contacts was possible and in the interest of both sides.Kissinger said President Nixon made the goal of establishing diplomatic relations with China an integral part of his international strategy as soon as he took office. The China side had the same consideration.According to Kissinger, there were also concerns on the China side at the time about the threat from the Soviet Union. Those were the two bases on which the Shanghai Communiqué made its breakthrough. The basic spirit of the communiqué, in his view, was to establish a direct cooperative relationship between the US and China.The two foundations Dr Kissinger spoke of reflect his idea of a balanced strategy. The central idea of his book World Order was that a balance of power based on the Peace of Westphalia was the key to avoiding war and building peace.This idea of strategic balance still influences US's global strategy today, and the adjustment of US policy toward China clearly comes from this idea.In recent years, some in US have insisted that the US-China relationship is headed for a breakdown because China has adopted a more aggressive strategy of foreign expansion, undermining the order that the US has worked on for years to establish in the Asia-Pacific region and is upsetting the global balance of power.Some US scholars also cited Kissinger's advice before Nixon's visit to China 50 years ago.According to declassified documents, Kissinger told Nixon at the time that the US should ""play the balance of power game without any emotion.""Kissinger also predicted that in 20 years, China would be ""even more powerful"" and reminded the US president at that time to consider how to rely on Russia to keep China down.Such a balance of power game is to create a US-led structure to balance the relationship between global powers. Essentially it is not about trying to cooperate with the other side, but to ensure that the US can suppress and dismantle the other side in order to achieve US hegemony. Such a balancing structure will eventually force many small and medium-sized countries to choose sides. The crisis in Ukraine, which has gone so far, is a typical example.However, after China's peaceful rise, such a balancing strategy has become increasingly difficult to achieve. China and the US have become increasingly interdependent over the course of the past 50 years, and it is clear that their relationship is no longer tempered by equilibrium. Any forces that US would like to leverage to reorganize the so-called balance will hardly stop China's continued development.Fifty years ago, the US-China relationship made a breakthrough because of the US balancing strategy, and now, 50 years later, the relationship is beginning to ""decouple."" This is because, in US's balanced strategy, it has never seen itself as a party that can be on an equal footing with its so-called rivals, but always calculating how to prevent other countries from challenging its hegemonic position.The author is a senior editor with People's Daily, and currently a senior fellow with the Chongyang Institute for Financial Studies at Renmin University of China. dinggang@globaltimes.com.cn.

273,"All sides should give Russia, Ukraine some space to resolve issue: Global Times editorial",Global Times,2022-02-23,"Russia President Vladimir Putin on Monday signed two decrees recognizing ""the Lugansk (LPR)"" and ""the Donetsk (DPR)"" as independent and sovereign states. Ukraine decided to recall its charge d'affairs in Russia and will reconsider its diplomatic relations with Russia. The sudden change in the Ukraine situation has aroused great concern around the world. In this regard, China State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi said on Tuesday that the legitimate security concerns of any country must be respected, and the purposes and principles of the UN Charter must be upheld. He said China once again called on all parties to exercise restraint, appreciate the importance of implementing the principle of indivisible security, and de-escalate the situation and resolve differences through dialogue and negotiations.It should be noted that it is very regrettable that the Ukraine issue has evolved so far. The US has continued its intensive containment on Russia, which finally forced Russia to try to realize its security demands in such a way. This is the outburst of the dissatisfaction of the party whose security demands have been ignored for a long time since the end of the Cold War. The situation in Ukraine is deteriorating. At this time, the international community cannot discard its efforts for peace and to avoid further escalating the situation.The prospect of the situation between Russia and Ukraine remains highly uncertain. The US and West countries immediately condemned Russia's move. The White House officials said further ""coordinated"" sanctions directed at Russia would be announced on Tuesday. UN Secretary-General António Guterres said Russia's decision is ""a violation of the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Ukraine and inconsistent with the principles of the Charter of the UN."" He called for addressing ""all issues peacefully."" Many countries said they should not give up diplomatic means to peacefully solve the problem and underlined that ""constructive diplomacy is the need of the hour.""The Russia-Ukraine crisis is a dual crisis, in which bilateral conflicts between Russia and Ukraine are intertwined with the strategic suppression that NATO's eastward expansion has brought to Russia. All relevant parties have put forward their own security demands before. Although no consensus was reached, that doesn't necessarily mean a complete breakup of negotiations. It hasn't reached the point that the issue must be solved by war. Whether the situation will further escalate next mainly depends on the scale of the US sanctions imposed on Russia and whether Russia will be provoked to take more aggressive measures.Peace and no war is in the biggest and common interests of all countries in the EU continent. In this sense, only by achieving a soft landing for the Russia-Ukraine crisis can EU realize peace. True security should be inalienable, common, integrated, cooperative and sustainable. This means all sides' security interests should be respected and safeguarded, and if any party's security concerns are ignored or even trampled on, geopolitical disputes will continue and never cease. The knot must be untied by the one who tied it. Russia and Ukraine need to have face-to-face dialogues. The US and NATO should be pulled back from the Russia-Ukraine crisis as much as possible and there should be no more complicated elements added to influence the situation.In particular, at a time when the situation is uncertain, all sides should leave some space for Russia and Ukraine to solve the problems. Confrontation, sanctions, or even a direct battle will not help ease tensions. The flames scattered in eastern Ukraine are reminding all parties of the fact that blindly imposing pressure will only lead to an escalation of conflicts. What is most needed there are restraints and rationality, as well as constructive efforts of the international community.   China has no self-interest in the Ukraine issue. It has always upheld a fair and responsible attitude and will decide its own position based on the merits of the matter itself. Although all parties have different views on the Ukraine crisis, the top priority now is to avoid any actions that could intensify tensions. The international community should reach such a consensus as soon as possible. The development of the Ukraine situation is the result of a series of complex factors. Now that it has come to the brink of a cliff, all parties should work together to pull it back.",OPINION,EDITORIAL,"United Nations Security Council meets after Russia recognized two breakaway regions in eastern Ukraine as independent entities, in New York City on Monday.

277,Title not found,Xinhua,2022-02-23," The EU (EU) is ready to take further action against Russia if it continues to escalate the crisis, EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen warned here on Tuesday.In a statement, von der Leyen said EU member states had given their political consent to a new package of sanctions against Russia following its recognition of the independence of the Ukraine regions of Donetsk and Luhansk.The package contains a number of ""calibrated measures"" targeting banks that finance the Russia military apparatus and contribute to the destabilization of Ukraine.It also bans trade between the two breakaway regions and the EU, as it did with Crimea in 2014, and limits the Russia government's ability to raise capital on the EU's financial markets.Russia President Vladimir Putin on Monday evening signed decrees recognizing the independence of two self-proclaimed regions in eastern Ukraine's Donbass as ""the Lugansk (LPR)"" and ""the Donetsk (DPR).""Russia has done everything to preserve the territorial integrity of Ukraine by fighting for the implementation of 2015 Minsk agreement, but all the efforts ended up in vain, Vladimir Putin said on Monday.The security crisis occurred due to NATO's eastward expansion, which has led to the loss of mutual trust with Russia, he noted.According to Josep Borrell, EU's High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, the package comprises sanctions against 351 members of the Russia State Duma (lower house of the country's Federal Assembly) who voted to recognize the two regions.The EU will also ""target 27 individuals and entities who are playing a role in undermining or threatening Ukraine's territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence,"" he said.Furthermore, the sanctions aim to target the Russia state's ability to access the EU's capital and financial markets and services.""If Russia continues to escalate this crisis that it has created, we are ready to take further action in response,"" von der Leyen said.On the controversial Russia-Germany Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, von der Leyen said she believed that the Germany government was ""absolutely right"" to stop the project, which must be assessed in light of the security of energy supply for all of EU.""This crisis shows that EU is still too dependent on Russia gas. We have to diversify our suppliers and massively invest in renewables. This is a strategic investment in our energy independence,"" she said.The conflict in eastern Ukraine began in April 2014 with fightings between the Ukraine government troops and local armed groups who seized several towns.With the mediation of the global community, the two sides in Belarus' capital of Minsk reached ceasefire agreements in September 2014 and February 2015 respectively.Russia has been seeking NATO's guarantee to halt eastward expansion. However, U.S. President Joe Biden's administration took a hard line against Russia, supporting Ukraine's efforts to join the U.S.-led military alliance and increasing its military assistance to Ukraine, which has re-escalated tensions in the region.The situation in eastern Ukraine has been getting worse since Feb. 17, as the Ukraine government and local armed groups blamed each other for launching aggressive bombards.",WORLD,EUROPE,"European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen makes a statement on the Ukraine issue in Brussels, Belgium, on Feb. 22, 2022.

281,"US hardly leads the West out of helplessness, but is in fact the cause",Zhao Minghao,2022-02-23,"The Munich Security Conference 2022 was held under the shadow of multiple challenges including the Ukraine crisis. The Munich Security Index 2022 shows perceptions of risk that pervade the societies of G7 countries due to COVID-19 pandemic, geopolitical tensions, domestic political polarization, and rising inequality. As the Munich Security Report 2022 points out, many West people believe that they are living in a ""new era of successive and interconnected disruptions,"" and there is a growing ""collective helplessness.""Such helplessness comes from domestic political dysfunction. Economic inequality, ethnic tensions, and intergenerational conflicts are old problems that become even worse in a polarized political environment. The stagnation of political reforms has largely contributed to ""crisis fatigue"" within the G7 countries mentioned in the Munich Security Report 2022. People feel less confident in their governments. According to a recent NBC News poll, only 22 percent answered that things are ""headed in the right direction.""The trend toward the retreat of democracy continues, warned Wolfgang Ischinger, chairman of the Munich Security Conference. The ""illiberal movement"" within the West is worsening, and there are challenges like populism and neo-fascism. US leadership in the West has been damaged due to its domestic illiberal movement. During the Joe Biden presidency, the US is more divided under the crisis of democracy. Helplessness stems from the external challenges West countries face, which are often self-imposed. NATO enlargement and the EU's expansion eastward are the key factors influencing Russia's strong responses to the Ukraine crisis, according to John Mearsheimer, professor at the University of Chicago. He pointed out that the Ukraine crisis is the West's fault as the West had been moving into Russia's backyard and threatening its core strategic interests. Indeed, Ukraine has the right to make a choice, but that choice should not expose its neighbor to a major security threat. Given the US and EU interference in Ukraine, it's hard to argue that Kiev's choice is truly ""independent."" Leaked classified documents show that senior US officials like Victoria Nuland, US' current under secretary of state for political affairs, have been weighing in on the make-up of the Ukraine government. For the US, the survival of NATO depends on deliberately created geopolitical tensions. The Obama administration's actions during the Russo-Georgian War and the Joe Biden administration's moves during the recent Ukraine crisis show to the world a rattled US government. ""Helpless"" EU must realize that there is indeed a geopolitical factor. Some EU countries, including Germany, seem to be interested in participating in the geopolitical game in the Indo-Pacific region, following US to provoke Beijing on the Taiwan question. This will bring them into trouble. Another contribution to the West's helplessness is the Afghanistan issue. With the hasty withdrawal of the US troops from Afghanistan, the humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan is getting worse because of the de facto US sanctions against the Taliban. The West does have a sense of frustration over Afghanistan, but it cannot be allowed to shrug off its responsibility in an immoral matter. The West is facing what former EU Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker called a ""polycrisis."" The US is hardly leading the West out of helplessness, and is in fact the cause. As the Munich Security Report 2022 emphasizes, collectively, they have the chance to turn the tide. Individually they risk being swept away. EU needs to make efforts to this end, especially to persuade US not to indulge in confrontations with China and Russia. The author is a senior fellow at the Charhar Institute and China Forum Expert at Tsinghua University. opinion@globaltimes.com.cn",OPINION,VIEWPOINT,"Outgoing Munich Security Conference Chairman Wolfgang Ischinger speaks at the end of the Munich Security Conference (MSC) in Munich, southern Germany, on February 20, 2022.

282,Can US’ balancing strategy last after Ukraine crisis?,Ding Gang,2022-02-23,"On February 21, 1972, US President Richard Nixon came to Beijing to begin a ""world-changing"" visit. He became the first sitting US president to visit China.On February 28, China and the US issued the Shanghai Joint Communiqué, which laid the foundation for the subsequent development of US-China relations.Twenty years ago, in February 2002, I interviewed Dr Kissinger in New York. Over the past two days, I have gone over my notes from that interview and have been filled with emotion.The China-US relationship seems to have gone through a strange circle, from breaking the ice in 1972, to steadily rising to a warm point in 2002, and then beginning to freeze again.The world is also in the midst of dramatic change. From Chairman Mao Zedong's handshake with President Nixon, to former President Donald Trump's ""decoupling"" with, to China-Russia back-to-back partnership today, and the outbreak of the Ukraine crisis, great powers are beginning to reorganize.I clearly remember Dr Kissinger telling me at the time that the breakthrough in the Shanghai Communiqué was largely due to a mutual recognition that establishing direct contacts was possible and in the interest of both sides.Kissinger said President Nixon made the goal of establishing diplomatic relations with China an integral part of his international strategy as soon as he took office. The China side had the same consideration.According to Kissinger, there were also concerns on the China side at the time about the threat from the Soviet Union. Those were the two bases on which the Shanghai Communiqué made its breakthrough. The basic spirit of the communiqué, in his view, was to establish a direct cooperative relationship between the US and China.The two foundations Dr Kissinger spoke of reflect his idea of a balanced strategy. The central idea of his book World Order was that a balance of power based on the Peace of Westphalia was the key to avoiding war and building peace.This idea of strategic balance still influences US's global strategy today, and the adjustment of US policy toward China clearly comes from this idea.In recent years, some in US have insisted that the US-China relationship is headed for a breakdown because China has adopted a more aggressive strategy of foreign expansion, undermining the order that the US has worked on for years to establish in the Asia-Pacific region and is upsetting the global balance of power.Some US scholars also cited Kissinger's advice before Nixon's visit to China 50 years ago.According to declassified documents, Kissinger told Nixon at the time that the US should ""play the balance of power game without any emotion.""Kissinger also predicted that in 20 years, China would be ""even more powerful"" and reminded the US president at that time to consider how to rely on Russia to keep China down.Such a balance of power game is to create a US-led structure to balance the relationship between global powers. Essentially it is not about trying to cooperate with the other side, but to ensure that the US can suppress and dismantle the other side in order to achieve US hegemony. Such a balancing structure will eventually force many small and medium-sized countries to choose sides. The crisis in Ukraine, which has gone so far, is a typical example.However, after China's peaceful rise, such a balancing strategy has become increasingly difficult to achieve. China and the US have become increasingly interdependent over the course of the past 50 years, and it is clear that their relationship is no longer tempered by equilibrium. Any forces that US would like to leverage to reorganize the so-called balance will hardly stop China's continued development.Fifty years ago, the US-China relationship made a breakthrough because of the US balancing strategy, and now, 50 years later, the relationship is beginning to ""decouple."" This is because, in US's balanced strategy, it has never seen itself as a party that can be on an equal footing with its so-called rivals, but always calculating how to prevent other countries from challenging its hegemonic position.The author is a senior editor with People's Daily, and currently a senior fellow with the Chongyang Institute for Financial Studies at Renmin University of China. dinggang@globaltimes.com.cn.

283,"All sides should give Russia, Ukraine some space to resolve issue: Global Times editorial",Global Times,2022-02-23,"Russia President Vladimir Putin on Monday signed two decrees recognizing ""the Lugansk (LPR)"" and ""the Donetsk (DPR)"" as independent and sovereign states. Ukraine decided to recall its charge d'affairs in Russia and will reconsider its diplomatic relations with Russia. The sudden change in the Ukraine situation has aroused great concern around the world. In this regard, China State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi said on Tuesday that the legitimate security concerns of any country must be respected, and the purposes and principles of the UN Charter must be upheld. He said China once again called on all parties to exercise restraint, appreciate the importance of implementing the principle of indivisible security, and de-escalate the situation and resolve differences through dialogue and negotiations.It should be noted that it is very regrettable that the Ukraine issue has evolved so far. The US has continued its intensive containment on Russia, which finally forced Russia to try to realize its security demands in such a way. This is the outburst of the dissatisfaction of the party whose security demands have been ignored for a long time since the end of the Cold War. The situation in Ukraine is deteriorating. At this time, the international community cannot discard its efforts for peace and to avoid further escalating the situation.The prospect of the situation between Russia and Ukraine remains highly uncertain. The US and West countries immediately condemned Russia's move. The White House officials said further ""coordinated"" sanctions directed at Russia would be announced on Tuesday. UN Secretary-General António Guterres said Russia's decision is ""a violation of the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Ukraine and inconsistent with the principles of the Charter of the UN."" He called for addressing ""all issues peacefully."" Many countries said they should not give up diplomatic means to peacefully solve the problem and underlined that ""constructive diplomacy is the need of the hour.""The Russia-Ukraine crisis is a dual crisis, in which bilateral conflicts between Russia and Ukraine are intertwined with the strategic suppression that NATO's eastward expansion has brought to Russia. All relevant parties have put forward their own security demands before. Although no consensus was reached, that doesn't necessarily mean a complete breakup of negotiations. It hasn't reached the point that the issue must be solved by war. Whether the situation will further escalate next mainly depends on the scale of the US sanctions imposed on Russia and whether Russia will be provoked to take more aggressive measures.Peace and no war is in the biggest and common interests of all countries in the EU continent. In this sense, only by achieving a soft landing for the Russia-Ukraine crisis can EU realize peace. True security should be inalienable, common, integrated, cooperative and sustainable. This means all sides' security interests should be respected and safeguarded, and if any party's security concerns are ignored or even trampled on, geopolitical disputes will continue and never cease. The knot must be untied by the one who tied it. Russia and Ukraine need to have face-to-face dialogues. The US and NATO should be pulled back from the Russia-Ukraine crisis as much as possible and there should be no more complicated elements added to influence the situation.In particular, at a time when the situation is uncertain, all sides should leave some space for Russia and Ukraine to solve the problems. Confrontation, sanctions, or even a direct battle will not help ease tensions. The flames scattered in eastern Ukraine are reminding all parties of the fact that blindly imposing pressure will only lead to an escalation of conflicts. What is most needed there are restraints and rationality, as well as constructive efforts of the international community.   China has no self-interest in the Ukraine issue. It has always upheld a fair and responsible attitude and will decide its own position based on the merits of the matter itself. Although all parties have different views on the Ukraine crisis, the top priority now is to avoid any actions that could intensify tensions. The international community should reach such a consensus as soon as possible. The development of the Ukraine situation is the result of a series of complex factors. Now that it has come to the brink of a cliff, all parties should work together to pull it back.",OPINION,EDITORIAL,"United Nations Security Council meets after Russia recognized two breakaway regions in eastern Ukraine as independent entities, in New York City on Monday.

287,"EU agrees Russia sanctions package, warns of further action",Xinhua,2022-02-23," The EU (EU) is ready to take further action against Russia if it continues to escalate the crisis, EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen warned here on Tuesday.In a statement, von der Leyen said EU member states had given their political consent to a new package of sanctions against Russia following its recognition of the independence of the Ukraine regions of Donetsk and Luhansk.The package contains a number of ""calibrated measures"" targeting banks that finance the Russia military apparatus and contribute to the destabilization of Ukraine.It also bans trade between the two breakaway regions and the EU, as it did with Crimea in 2014, and limits the Russia government's ability to raise capital on the EU's financial markets.Russia President Vladimir Putin on Monday evening signed decrees recognizing the independence of two self-proclaimed regions in eastern Ukraine's Donbass as ""the Lugansk (LPR)"" and ""the Donetsk (DPR).""Russia has done everything to preserve the territorial integrity of Ukraine by fighting for the implementation of 2015 Minsk agreement, but all the efforts ended up in vain, Vladimir Putin said on Monday.The security crisis occurred due to NATO's eastward expansion, which has led to the loss of mutual trust with Russia, he noted.According to Josep Borrell, EU's High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, the package comprises sanctions against 351 members of the Russia State Duma (lower house of the country's Federal Assembly) who voted to recognize the two regions.The EU will also ""target 27 individuals and entities who are playing a role in undermining or threatening Ukraine's territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence,"" he said.Furthermore, the sanctions aim to target the Russia state's ability to access the EU's capital and financial markets and services.""If Russia continues to escalate this crisis that it has created, we are ready to take further action in response,"" von der Leyen said.On the controversial Russia-Germany Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, von der Leyen said she believed that the Germany government was ""absolutely right"" to stop the project, which must be assessed in light of the security of energy supply for all of EU.""This crisis shows that EU is still too dependent on Russia gas. We have to diversify our suppliers and massively invest in renewables. This is a strategic investment in our energy independence,"" she said.The conflict in eastern Ukraine began in April 2014 with fightings between the Ukraine government troops and local armed groups who seized several towns.With the mediation of the global community, the two sides in Belarus' capital of Minsk reached ceasefire agreements in September 2014 and February 2015 respectively.Russia has been seeking NATO's guarantee to halt eastward expansion. However, U.S. President Joe Biden's administration took a hard line against Russia, supporting Ukraine's efforts to join the U.S.-led military alliance and increasing its military assistance to Ukraine, which has re-escalated tensions in the region.The situation in eastern Ukraine has been getting worse since Feb. 17, as the Ukraine government and local armed groups blamed each other for launching aggressive bombards.",WORLD,EUROPE,"European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen makes a statement on the Ukraine issue in Brussels, Belgium, on Feb. 22, 2022.

Ukraine refused to recognize their self-proclaimed status.Calling Russia's move ""the beginning of a Russia invasion of Ukraine,"" Joe Biden said in remarks delivered from the White House that his administration will impose sanctions on two Russia financial institutions - the VEB and the country's military bank -- as well as on Russia's sovereign debt and three individuals.He explained that the measure ""means we've cut off Russia's government from West financing.

291,"US hardly leads the West out of helplessness, but is in fact the cause",Zhao Minghao,2022-02-23,"The Munich Security Conference 2022 was held under the shadow of multiple challenges including the Ukraine crisis. The Munich Security Index 2022 shows perceptions of risk that pervade the societies of G7 countries due to COVID-19 pandemic, geopolitical tensions, domestic political polarization, and rising inequality. As the Munich Security Report 2022 points out, many West people believe that they are living in a ""new era of successive and interconnected disruptions,"" and there is a growing ""collective helplessness.""Such helplessness comes from domestic political dysfunction. Economic inequality, ethnic tensions, and intergenerational conflicts are old problems that become even worse in a polarized political environment. The stagnation of political reforms has largely contributed to ""crisis fatigue"" within the G7 countries mentioned in the Munich Security Report 2022. People feel less confident in their governments. According to a recent NBC News poll, only 22 percent answered that things are ""headed in the right direction.""The trend toward the retreat of democracy continues, warned Wolfgang Ischinger, chairman of the Munich Security Conference. The ""illiberal movement"" within the West is worsening, and there are challenges like populism and neo-fascism. US leadership in the West has been damaged due to its domestic illiberal movement. During the Joe Biden presidency, the US is more divided under the crisis of democracy. Helplessness stems from the external challenges West countries face, which are often self-imposed. NATO enlargement and the EU's expansion eastward are the key factors influencing Russia's strong responses to the Ukraine crisis, according to John Mearsheimer, professor at the University of Chicago. He pointed out that the Ukraine crisis is the West's fault as the West had been moving into Russia's backyard and threatening its core strategic interests. Indeed, Ukraine has the right to make a choice, but that choice should not expose its neighbor to a major security threat. Given the US and EU interference in Ukraine, it's hard to argue that Kiev's choice is truly ""independent."" Leaked classified documents show that senior US officials like Victoria Nuland, US' current under secretary of state for political affairs, have been weighing in on the make-up of the Ukraine government. For the US, the survival of NATO depends on deliberately created geopolitical tensions. The Obama administration's actions during the Russo-Georgian War and the Joe Biden administration's moves during the recent Ukraine crisis show to the world a rattled US government. ""Helpless"" EU must realize that there is indeed a geopolitical factor. Some EU countries, including Germany, seem to be interested in participating in the geopolitical game in the Indo-Pacific region, following US to provoke Beijing on the Taiwan question. This will bring them into trouble. Another contribution to the West's helplessness is the Afghanistan issue. With the hasty withdrawal of the US troops from Afghanistan, the humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan is getting worse because of the de facto US sanctions against the Taliban. The West does have a sense of frustration over Afghanistan, but it cannot be allowed to shrug off its responsibility in an immoral matter. The West is facing what former EU Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker called a ""polycrisis."" The US is hardly leading the West out of helplessness, and is in fact the cause. As the Munich Security Report 2022 emphasizes, collectively, they have the chance to turn the tide. Individually they risk being swept away. EU needs to make efforts to this end, especially to persuade US not to indulge in confrontations with China and Russia. The author is a senior fellow at the Charhar Institute and China Forum Expert at Tsinghua University. opinion@globaltimes.com.cn",OPINION,VIEWPOINT,"Outgoing Munich Security Conference Chairman Wolfgang Ischinger speaks at the end of the Munich Security Conference (MSC) in Munich, southern Germany, on February 20, 2022.

292,Can US’ balancing strategy last after Ukraine crisis?,Ding Gang,2022-02-23,"On February 21, 1972, US President Richard Nixon came to Beijing to begin a ""world-changing"" visit. He became the first sitting US president to visit China.On February 28, China and the US issued the Shanghai Joint Communiqué, which laid the foundation for the subsequent development of US-China relations.Twenty years ago, in February 2002, I interviewed Dr Kissinger in New York. Over the past two days, I have gone over my notes from that interview and have been filled with emotion.The China-US relationship seems to have gone through a strange circle, from breaking the ice in 1972, to steadily rising to a warm point in 2002, and then beginning to freeze again.The world is also in the midst of dramatic change. From Chairman Mao Zedong's handshake with President Nixon, to former President Donald Trump's ""decoupling"" with, to China-Russia back-to-back partnership today, and the outbreak of the Ukraine crisis, great powers are beginning to reorganize.I clearly remember Dr Kissinger telling me at the time that the breakthrough in the Shanghai Communiqué was largely due to a mutual recognition that establishing direct contacts was possible and in the interest of both sides.Kissinger said President Nixon made the goal of establishing diplomatic relations with China an integral part of his international strategy as soon as he took office. The China side had the same consideration.According to Kissinger, there were also concerns on the China side at the time about the threat from the Soviet Union. Those were the two bases on which the Shanghai Communiqué made its breakthrough. The basic spirit of the communiqué, in his view, was to establish a direct cooperative relationship between the US and China.The two foundations Dr Kissinger spoke of reflect his idea of a balanced strategy. The central idea of his book World Order was that a balance of power based on the Peace of Westphalia was the key to avoiding war and building peace.This idea of strategic balance still influences US's global strategy today, and the adjustment of US policy toward China clearly comes from this idea.In recent years, some in US have insisted that the US-China relationship is headed for a breakdown because China has adopted a more aggressive strategy of foreign expansion, undermining the order that the US has worked on for years to establish in the Asia-Pacific region and is upsetting the global balance of power.Some US scholars also cited Kissinger's advice before Nixon's visit to China 50 years ago.According to declassified documents, Kissinger told Nixon at the time that the US should ""play the balance of power game without any emotion.""Kissinger also predicted that in 20 years, China would be ""even more powerful"" and reminded the US president at that time to consider how to rely on Russia to keep China down.Such a balance of power game is to create a US-led structure to balance the relationship between global powers. Essentially it is not about trying to cooperate with the other side, but to ensure that the US can suppress and dismantle the other side in order to achieve US hegemony. Such a balancing structure will eventually force many small and medium-sized countries to choose sides. The crisis in Ukraine, which has gone so far, is a typical example.However, after China's peaceful rise, such a balancing strategy has become increasingly difficult to achieve. China and the US have become increasingly interdependent over the course of the past 50 years, and it is clear that their relationship is no longer tempered by equilibrium. Any forces that US would like to leverage to reorganize the so-called balance will hardly stop China's continued development.Fifty years ago, the US-China relationship made a breakthrough because of the US balancing strategy, and now, 50 years later, the relationship is beginning to ""decouple."" This is because, in US's balanced strategy, it has never seen itself as a party that can be on an equal footing with its so-called rivals, but always calculating how to prevent other countries from challenging its hegemonic position.The author is a senior editor with People's Daily, and currently a senior fellow with the Chongyang Institute for Financial Studies at Renmin University of China. dinggang@globaltimes.com.cn.

293,"All sides should give Russia, Ukraine some space to resolve issue: Global Times editorial",Global Times,2022-02-23,"Russia President Vladimir Putin on Monday signed two decrees recognizing ""the Lugansk (LPR)"" and ""the Donetsk (DPR)"" as independent and sovereign states. Ukraine decided to recall its charge d'affairs in Russia and will reconsider its diplomatic relations with Russia. The sudden change in the Ukraine situation has aroused great concern around the world. In this regard, China State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi said on Tuesday that the legitimate security concerns of any country must be respected, and the purposes and principles of the UN Charter must be upheld. He said China once again called on all parties to exercise restraint, appreciate the importance of implementing the principle of indivisible security, and de-escalate the situation and resolve differences through dialogue and negotiations.It should be noted that it is very regrettable that the Ukraine issue has evolved so far. The US has continued its intensive containment on Russia, which finally forced Russia to try to realize its security demands in such a way. This is the outburst of the dissatisfaction of the party whose security demands have been ignored for a long time since the end of the Cold War. The situation in Ukraine is deteriorating. At this time, the international community cannot discard its efforts for peace and to avoid further escalating the situation.The prospect of the situation between Russia and Ukraine remains highly uncertain. The US and West countries immediately condemned Russia's move. The White House officials said further ""coordinated"" sanctions directed at Russia would be announced on Tuesday. UN Secretary-General António Guterres said Russia's decision is ""a violation of the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Ukraine and inconsistent with the principles of the Charter of the UN."" He called for addressing ""all issues peacefully."" Many countries said they should not give up diplomatic means to peacefully solve the problem and underlined that ""constructive diplomacy is the need of the hour.""The Russia-Ukraine crisis is a dual crisis, in which bilateral conflicts between Russia and Ukraine are intertwined with the strategic suppression that NATO's eastward expansion has brought to Russia. All relevant parties have put forward their own security demands before. Although no consensus was reached, that doesn't necessarily mean a complete breakup of negotiations. It hasn't reached the point that the issue must be solved by war. Whether the situation will further escalate next mainly depends on the scale of the US sanctions imposed on Russia and whether Russia will be provoked to take more aggressive measures.Peace and no war is in the biggest and common interests of all countries in the EU continent. In this sense, only by achieving a soft landing for the Russia-Ukraine crisis can EU realize peace. True security should be inalienable, common, integrated, cooperative and sustainable. This means all sides' security interests should be respected and safeguarded, and if any party's security concerns are ignored or even trampled on, geopolitical disputes will continue and never cease. The knot must be untied by the one who tied it. Russia and Ukraine need to have face-to-face dialogues. The US and NATO should be pulled back from the Russia-Ukraine crisis as much as possible and there should be no more complicated elements added to influence the situation.In particular, at a time when the situation is uncertain, all sides should leave some space for Russia and Ukraine to solve the problems. Confrontation, sanctions, or even a direct battle will not help ease tensions. The flames scattered in eastern Ukraine are reminding all parties of the fact that blindly imposing pressure will only lead to an escalation of conflicts. What is most needed there are restraints and rationality, as well as constructive efforts of the international community.   China has no self-interest in the Ukraine issue. It has always upheld a fair and responsible attitude and will decide its own position based on the merits of the matter itself. Although all parties have different views on the Ukraine crisis, the top priority now is to avoid any actions that could intensify tensions. The international community should reach such a consensus as soon as possible. The development of the Ukraine situation is the result of a series of complex factors. Now that it has come to the brink of a cliff, all parties should work together to pull it back.",OPINION,EDITORIAL,"United Nations Security Council meets after Russia recognized two breakaway regions in eastern Ukraine as independent entities, in New York City on Monday.

297,"EU agrees Russia sanctions package, warns of further action",Xinhua,2022-02-23," The EU (EU) is ready to take further action against Russia if it continues to escalate the crisis, EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen warned here on Tuesday.In a statement, von der Leyen said EU member states had given their political consent to a new package of sanctions against Russia following its recognition of the independence of the Ukraine regions of Donetsk and Luhansk.The package contains a number of ""calibrated measures"" targeting banks that finance the Russia military apparatus and contribute to the destabilization of Ukraine.It also bans trade between the two breakaway regions and the EU, as it did with Crimea in 2014, and limits the Russia government's ability to raise capital on the EU's financial markets.Russia President Vladimir Putin on Monday evening signed decrees recognizing the independence of two self-proclaimed regions in eastern Ukraine's Donbass as ""the Lugansk (LPR)"" and ""the Donetsk (DPR).""Russia has done everything to preserve the territorial integrity of Ukraine by fighting for the implementation of 2015 Minsk agreement, but all the efforts ended up in vain, Vladimir Putin said on Monday.The security crisis occurred due to NATO's eastward expansion, which has led to the loss of mutual trust with Russia, he noted.According to Josep Borrell, EU's High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, the package comprises sanctions against 351 members of the Russia State Duma (lower house of the country's Federal Assembly) who voted to recognize the two regions.The EU will also ""target 27 individuals and entities who are playing a role in undermining or threatening Ukraine's territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence,"" he said.Furthermore, the sanctions aim to target the Russia state's ability to access the EU's capital and financial markets and services.""If Russia continues to escalate this crisis that it has created, we are ready to take further action in response,"" von der Leyen said.On the controversial Russia-Germany Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, von der Leyen said she believed that the Germany government was ""absolutely right"" to stop the project, which must be assessed in light of the security of energy supply for all of EU.""This crisis shows that EU is still too dependent on Russia gas. We have to diversify our suppliers and massively invest in renewables. This is a strategic investment in our energy independence,"" she said.The conflict in eastern Ukraine began in April 2014 with fightings between the Ukraine government troops and local armed groups who seized several towns.With the mediation of the global community, the two sides in Belarus' capital of Minsk reached ceasefire agreements in September 2014 and February 2015 respectively.Russia has been seeking NATO's guarantee to halt eastward expansion. However, U.S. President Joe Biden's administration took a hard line against Russia, supporting Ukraine's efforts to join the U.S.-led military alliance and increasing its military assistance to Ukraine, which has re-escalated tensions in the region.The situation in eastern Ukraine has been getting worse since Feb. 17, as the Ukraine government and local armed groups blamed each other for launching aggressive bombards.",WORLD,EUROPE,"European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen makes a statement on the Ukraine issue in Brussels, Belgium, on Feb. 22, 2022.

Ukraine refused to recognize their self-proclaimed status.Calling Russia's move ""the beginning of a Russia invasion of Ukraine,"" Joe Biden said in remarks delivered from the White House that his administration will impose sanctions on two Russia financial institutions - the VEB and the country's military bank -- as well as on Russia's sovereign debt and three individuals.He explained that the measure ""means we've cut off Russia's government from West financing.

301,"US hardly leads the West out of helplessness, but is in fact the cause",Zhao Minghao,2022-02-23,"The Munich Security Conference 2022 was held under the shadow of multiple challenges including the Ukraine crisis. The Munich Security Index 2022 shows perceptions of risk that pervade the societies of G7 countries due to COVID-19 pandemic, geopolitical tensions, domestic political polarization, and rising inequality. As the Munich Security Report 2022 points out, many West people believe that they are living in a ""new era of successive and interconnected disruptions,"" and there is a growing ""collective helplessness.""Such helplessness comes from domestic political dysfunction. Economic inequality, ethnic tensions, and intergenerational conflicts are old problems that become even worse in a polarized political environment. The stagnation of political reforms has largely contributed to ""crisis fatigue"" within the G7 countries mentioned in the Munich Security Report 2022. People feel less confident in their governments. According to a recent NBC News poll, only 22 percent answered that things are ""headed in the right direction.""The trend toward the retreat of democracy continues, warned Wolfgang Ischinger, chairman of the Munich Security Conference. The ""illiberal movement"" within the West is worsening, and there are challenges like populism and neo-fascism. US leadership in the West has been damaged due to its domestic illiberal movement. During the Joe Biden presidency, the US is more divided under the crisis of democracy. Helplessness stems from the external challenges West countries face, which are often self-imposed. NATO enlargement and the EU's expansion eastward are the key factors influencing Russia's strong responses to the Ukraine crisis, according to John Mearsheimer, professor at the University of Chicago. He pointed out that the Ukraine crisis is the West's fault as the West had been moving into Russia's backyard and threatening its core strategic interests. Indeed, Ukraine has the right to make a choice, but that choice should not expose its neighbor to a major security threat. Given the US and EU interference in Ukraine, it's hard to argue that Kiev's choice is truly ""independent."" Leaked classified documents show that senior US officials like Victoria Nuland, US' current under secretary of state for political affairs, have been weighing in on the make-up of the Ukraine government. For the US, the survival of NATO depends on deliberately created geopolitical tensions. The Obama administration's actions during the Russo-Georgian War and the Joe Biden administration's moves during the recent Ukraine crisis show to the world a rattled US government. ""Helpless"" EU must realize that there is indeed a geopolitical factor. Some EU countries, including Germany, seem to be interested in participating in the geopolitical game in the Indo-Pacific region, following US to provoke Beijing on the Taiwan question. This will bring them into trouble. Another contribution to the West's helplessness is the Afghanistan issue. With the hasty withdrawal of the US troops from Afghanistan, the humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan is getting worse because of the de facto US sanctions against the Taliban. The West does have a sense of frustration over Afghanistan, but it cannot be allowed to shrug off its responsibility in an immoral matter. The West is facing what former EU Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker called a ""polycrisis."" The US is hardly leading the West out of helplessness, and is in fact the cause. As the Munich Security Report 2022 emphasizes, collectively, they have the chance to turn the tide. Individually they risk being swept away. EU needs to make efforts to this end, especially to persuade US not to indulge in confrontations with China and Russia. The author is a senior fellow at the Charhar Institute and China Forum Expert at Tsinghua University. opinion@globaltimes.com.cn",OPINION,VIEWPOINT,"Outgoing Munich Security Conference Chairman Wolfgang Ischinger speaks at the end of the Munich Security Conference (MSC) in Munich, southern Germany, on February 20, 2022.

302,Can US’ balancing strategy last after Ukraine crisis?,Ding Gang,2022-02-23,"On February 21, 1972, US President Richard Nixon came to Beijing to begin a ""world-changing"" visit. He became the first sitting US president to visit China.On February 28, China and the US issued the Shanghai Joint Communiqué, which laid the foundation for the subsequent development of US-China relations.Twenty years ago, in February 2002, I interviewed Dr Kissinger in New York. Over the past two days, I have gone over my notes from that interview and have been filled with emotion.The China-US relationship seems to have gone through a strange circle, from breaking the ice in 1972, to steadily rising to a warm point in 2002, and then beginning to freeze again.The world is also in the midst of dramatic change. From Chairman Mao Zedong's handshake with President Nixon, to former President Donald Trump's ""decoupling"" with, to China-Russia back-to-back partnership today, and the outbreak of the Ukraine crisis, great powers are beginning to reorganize.I clearly remember Dr Kissinger telling me at the time that the breakthrough in the Shanghai Communiqué was largely due to a mutual recognition that establishing direct contacts was possible and in the interest of both sides.Kissinger said President Nixon made the goal of establishing diplomatic relations with China an integral part of his international strategy as soon as he took office. The China side had the same consideration.According to Kissinger, there were also concerns on the China side at the time about the threat from the Soviet Union. Those were the two bases on which the Shanghai Communiqué made its breakthrough. The basic spirit of the communiqué, in his view, was to establish a direct cooperative relationship between the US and China.The two foundations Dr Kissinger spoke of reflect his idea of a balanced strategy. The central idea of his book World Order was that a balance of power based on the Peace of Westphalia was the key to avoiding war and building peace.This idea of strategic balance still influences US's global strategy today, and the adjustment of US policy toward China clearly comes from this idea.In recent years, some in US have insisted that the US-China relationship is headed for a breakdown because China has adopted a more aggressive strategy of foreign expansion, undermining the order that the US has worked on for years to establish in the Asia-Pacific region and is upsetting the global balance of power.Some US scholars also cited Kissinger's advice before Nixon's visit to China 50 years ago.According to declassified documents, Kissinger told Nixon at the time that the US should ""play the balance of power game without any emotion.""Kissinger also predicted that in 20 years, China would be ""even more powerful"" and reminded the US president at that time to consider how to rely on Russia to keep China down.Such a balance of power game is to create a US-led structure to balance the relationship between global powers. Essentially it is not about trying to cooperate with the other side, but to ensure that the US can suppress and dismantle the other side in order to achieve US hegemony. Such a balancing structure will eventually force many small and medium-sized countries to choose sides. The crisis in Ukraine, which has gone so far, is a typical example.However, after China's peaceful rise, such a balancing strategy has become increasingly difficult to achieve. China and the US have become increasingly interdependent over the course of the past 50 years, and it is clear that their relationship is no longer tempered by equilibrium. Any forces that US would like to leverage to reorganize the so-called balance will hardly stop China's continued development.Fifty years ago, the US-China relationship made a breakthrough because of the US balancing strategy, and now, 50 years later, the relationship is beginning to ""decouple."" This is because, in US's balanced strategy, it has never seen itself as a party that can be on an equal footing with its so-called rivals, but always calculating how to prevent other countries from challenging its hegemonic position.The author is a senior editor with People's Daily, and currently a senior fellow with the Chongyang Institute for Financial Studies at Renmin University of China. dinggang@globaltimes.com.cn.

303,"All sides should give Russia, Ukraine some space to resolve issue: Global Times editorial",Global Times,2022-02-23,"Russia President Vladimir Putin on Monday signed two decrees recognizing ""the Lugansk (LPR)"" and ""the Donetsk (DPR)"" as independent and sovereign states. Ukraine decided to recall its charge d'affairs in Russia and will reconsider its diplomatic relations with Russia. The sudden change in the Ukraine situation has aroused great concern around the world. In this regard, China State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi said on Tuesday that the legitimate security concerns of any country must be respected, and the purposes and principles of the UN Charter must be upheld. He said China once again called on all parties to exercise restraint, appreciate the importance of implementing the principle of indivisible security, and de-escalate the situation and resolve differences through dialogue and negotiations.It should be noted that it is very regrettable that the Ukraine issue has evolved so far. The US has continued its intensive containment on Russia, which finally forced Russia to try to realize its security demands in such a way. This is the outburst of the dissatisfaction of the party whose security demands have been ignored for a long time since the end of the Cold War. The situation in Ukraine is deteriorating. At this time, the international community cannot discard its efforts for peace and to avoid further escalating the situation.The prospect of the situation between Russia and Ukraine remains highly uncertain. The US and West countries immediately condemned Russia's move. The White House officials said further ""coordinated"" sanctions directed at Russia would be announced on Tuesday. UN Secretary-General António Guterres said Russia's decision is ""a violation of the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Ukraine and inconsistent with the principles of the Charter of the UN."" He called for addressing ""all issues peacefully."" Many countries said they should not give up diplomatic means to peacefully solve the problem and underlined that ""constructive diplomacy is the need of the hour.""The Russia-Ukraine crisis is a dual crisis, in which bilateral conflicts between Russia and Ukraine are intertwined with the strategic suppression that NATO's eastward expansion has brought to Russia. All relevant parties have put forward their own security demands before. Although no consensus was reached, that doesn't necessarily mean a complete breakup of negotiations. It hasn't reached the point that the issue must be solved by war. Whether the situation will further escalate next mainly depends on the scale of the US sanctions imposed on Russia and whether Russia will be provoked to take more aggressive measures.Peace and no war is in the biggest and common interests of all countries in the EU continent. In this sense, only by achieving a soft landing for the Russia-Ukraine crisis can EU realize peace. True security should be inalienable, common, integrated, cooperative and sustainable. This means all sides' security interests should be respected and safeguarded, and if any party's security concerns are ignored or even trampled on, geopolitical disputes will continue and never cease. The knot must be untied by the one who tied it. Russia and Ukraine need to have face-to-face dialogues. The US and NATO should be pulled back from the Russia-Ukraine crisis as much as possible and there should be no more complicated elements added to influence the situation.In particular, at a time when the situation is uncertain, all sides should leave some space for Russia and Ukraine to solve the problems. Confrontation, sanctions, or even a direct battle will not help ease tensions. The flames scattered in eastern Ukraine are reminding all parties of the fact that blindly imposing pressure will only lead to an escalation of conflicts. What is most needed there are restraints and rationality, as well as constructive efforts of the international community.   China has no self-interest in the Ukraine issue. It has always upheld a fair and responsible attitude and will decide its own position based on the merits of the matter itself. Although all parties have different views on the Ukraine crisis, the top priority now is to avoid any actions that could intensify tensions. The international community should reach such a consensus as soon as possible. The development of the Ukraine situation is the result of a series of complex factors. Now that it has come to the brink of a cliff, all parties should work together to pull it back.",OPINION,EDITORIAL,"United Nations Security Council meets after Russia recognized two breakaway regions in eastern Ukraine as independent entities, in New York City on Monday.

307,"EU agrees Russia sanctions package, warns of further action",Xinhua,2022-02-23," The EU (EU) is ready to take further action against Russia if it continues to escalate the crisis, EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen warned here on Tuesday.In a statement, von der Leyen said EU member states had given their political consent to a new package of sanctions against Russia following its recognition of the independence of the Ukraine regions of Donetsk and Luhansk.The package contains a number of ""calibrated measures"" targeting banks that finance the Russia military apparatus and contribute to the destabilization of Ukraine.It also bans trade between the two breakaway regions and the EU, as it did with Crimea in 2014, and limits the Russia government's ability to raise capital on the EU's financial markets.Russia President Vladimir Putin on Monday evening signed decrees recognizing the independence of two self-proclaimed regions in eastern Ukraine's Donbass as ""the Lugansk (LPR)"" and ""the Donetsk (DPR).""Russia has done everything to preserve the territorial integrity of Ukraine by fighting for the implementation of 2015 Minsk agreement, but all the efforts ended up in vain, Vladimir Putin said on Monday.The security crisis occurred due to NATO's eastward expansion, which has led to the loss of mutual trust with Russia, he noted.According to Josep Borrell, EU's High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, the package comprises sanctions against 351 members of the Russia State Duma (lower house of the country's Federal Assembly) who voted to recognize the two regions.The EU will also ""target 27 individuals and entities who are playing a role in undermining or threatening Ukraine's territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence,"" he said.Furthermore, the sanctions aim to target the Russia state's ability to access the EU's capital and financial markets and services.""If Russia continues to escalate this crisis that it has created, we are ready to take further action in response,"" von der Leyen said.On the controversial Russia-Germany Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, von der Leyen said she believed that the Germany government was ""absolutely right"" to stop the project, which must be assessed in light of the security of energy supply for all of EU.""This crisis shows that EU is still too dependent on Russia gas. We have to diversify our suppliers and massively invest in renewables. This is a strategic investment in our energy independence,"" she said.The conflict in eastern Ukraine began in April 2014 with fightings between the Ukraine government troops and local armed groups who seized several towns.With the mediation of the global community, the two sides in Belarus' capital of Minsk reached ceasefire agreements in September 2014 and February 2015 respectively.Russia has been seeking NATO's guarantee to halt eastward expansion. However, U.S. President Joe Biden's administration took a hard line against Russia, supporting Ukraine's efforts to join the U.S.-led military alliance and increasing its military assistance to Ukraine, which has re-escalated tensions in the region.The situation in eastern Ukraine has been getting worse since Feb. 17, as the Ukraine government and local armed groups blamed each other for launching aggressive bombards.",WORLD,EUROPE,"European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen makes a statement on the Ukraine issue in Brussels, Belgium, on Feb. 22, 2022.

Ukraine refused to recognize their self-proclaimed status.Calling Russia's move ""the beginning of a Russia invasion of Ukraine,"" Joe Biden said in remarks delivered from the White House that his administration will impose sanctions on two Russia financial institutions - the VEB and the country's military bank -- as well as on Russia's sovereign debt and three individuals.He explained that the measure ""means we've cut off Russia's government from West financing.

311,"US hardly leads the West out of helplessness, but is in fact the cause",Zhao Minghao,2022-02-23,"The Munich Security Conference 2022 was held under the shadow of multiple challenges including the Ukraine crisis. The Munich Security Index 2022 shows perceptions of risk that pervade the societies of G7 countries due to COVID-19 pandemic, geopolitical tensions, domestic political polarization, and rising inequality. As the Munich Security Report 2022 points out, many West people believe that they are living in a ""new era of successive and interconnected disruptions,"" and there is a growing ""collective helplessness.""Such helplessness comes from domestic political dysfunction. Economic inequality, ethnic tensions, and intergenerational conflicts are old problems that become even worse in a polarized political environment. The stagnation of political reforms has largely contributed to ""crisis fatigue"" within the G7 countries mentioned in the Munich Security Report 2022. People feel less confident in their governments. According to a recent NBC News poll, only 22 percent answered that things are ""headed in the right direction.""The trend toward the retreat of democracy continues, warned Wolfgang Ischinger, chairman of the Munich Security Conference. The ""illiberal movement"" within the West is worsening, and there are challenges like populism and neo-fascism. US leadership in the West has been damaged due to its domestic illiberal movement. During the Joe Biden presidency, the US is more divided under the crisis of democracy. Helplessness stems from the external challenges West countries face, which are often self-imposed. NATO enlargement and the EU's expansion eastward are the key factors influencing Russia's strong responses to the Ukraine crisis, according to John Mearsheimer, professor at the University of Chicago. He pointed out that the Ukraine crisis is the West's fault as the West had been moving into Russia's backyard and threatening its core strategic interests. Indeed, Ukraine has the right to make a choice, but that choice should not expose its neighbor to a major security threat. Given the US and EU interference in Ukraine, it's hard to argue that Kiev's choice is truly ""independent."" Leaked classified documents show that senior US officials like Victoria Nuland, US' current under secretary of state for political affairs, have been weighing in on the make-up of the Ukraine government. For the US, the survival of NATO depends on deliberately created geopolitical tensions. The Obama administration's actions during the Russo-Georgian War and the Joe Biden administration's moves during the recent Ukraine crisis show to the world a rattled US government. ""Helpless"" EU must realize that there is indeed a geopolitical factor. Some EU countries, including Germany, seem to be interested in participating in the geopolitical game in the Indo-Pacific region, following US to provoke Beijing on the Taiwan question. This will bring them into trouble. Another contribution to the West's helplessness is the Afghanistan issue. With the hasty withdrawal of the US troops from Afghanistan, the humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan is getting worse because of the de facto US sanctions against the Taliban. The West does have a sense of frustration over Afghanistan, but it cannot be allowed to shrug off its responsibility in an immoral matter. The West is facing what former EU Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker called a ""polycrisis."" The US is hardly leading the West out of helplessness, and is in fact the cause. As the Munich Security Report 2022 emphasizes, collectively, they have the chance to turn the tide. Individually they risk being swept away. EU needs to make efforts to this end, especially to persuade US not to indulge in confrontations with China and Russia. The author is a senior fellow at the Charhar Institute and China Forum Expert at Tsinghua University. opinion@globaltimes.com.cn",OPINION,VIEWPOINT,"Outgoing Munich Security Conference Chairman Wolfgang Ischinger speaks at the end of the Munich Security Conference (MSC) in Munich, southern Germany, on February 20, 2022.

312,Can US’ balancing strategy last after Ukraine crisis?,Ding Gang,2022-02-23,"On February 21, 1972, US President Richard Nixon came to Beijing to begin a ""world-changing"" visit. He became the first sitting US president to visit China.On February 28, China and the US issued the Shanghai Joint Communiqué, which laid the foundation for the subsequent development of US-China relations.Twenty years ago, in February 2002, I interviewed Dr Kissinger in New York. Over the past two days, I have gone over my notes from that interview and have been filled with emotion.The China-US relationship seems to have gone through a strange circle, from breaking the ice in 1972, to steadily rising to a warm point in 2002, and then beginning to freeze again.The world is also in the midst of dramatic change. From Chairman Mao Zedong's handshake with President Nixon, to former President Donald Trump's ""decoupling"" with, to China-Russia back-to-back partnership today, and the outbreak of the Ukraine crisis, great powers are beginning to reorganize.I clearly remember Dr Kissinger telling me at the time that the breakthrough in the Shanghai Communiqué was largely due to a mutual recognition that establishing direct contacts was possible and in the interest of both sides.Kissinger said President Nixon made the goal of establishing diplomatic relations with China an integral part of his international strategy as soon as he took office. The China side had the same consideration.According to Kissinger, there were also concerns on the China side at the time about the threat from the Soviet Union. Those were the two bases on which the Shanghai Communiqué made its breakthrough. The basic spirit of the communiqué, in his view, was to establish a direct cooperative relationship between the US and China.The two foundations Dr Kissinger spoke of reflect his idea of a balanced strategy. The central idea of his book World Order was that a balance of power based on the Peace of Westphalia was the key to avoiding war and building peace.This idea of strategic balance still influences US's global strategy today, and the adjustment of US policy toward China clearly comes from this idea.In recent years, some in US have insisted that the US-China relationship is headed for a breakdown because China has adopted a more aggressive strategy of foreign expansion, undermining the order that the US has worked on for years to establish in the Asia-Pacific region and is upsetting the global balance of power.Some US scholars also cited Kissinger's advice before Nixon's visit to China 50 years ago.According to declassified documents, Kissinger told Nixon at the time that the US should ""play the balance of power game without any emotion.""Kissinger also predicted that in 20 years, China would be ""even more powerful"" and reminded the US president at that time to consider how to rely on Russia to keep China down.Such a balance of power game is to create a US-led structure to balance the relationship between global powers. Essentially it is not about trying to cooperate with the other side, but to ensure that the US can suppress and dismantle the other side in order to achieve US hegemony. Such a balancing structure will eventually force many small and medium-sized countries to choose sides. The crisis in Ukraine, which has gone so far, is a typical example.However, after China's peaceful rise, such a balancing strategy has become increasingly difficult to achieve. China and the US have become increasingly interdependent over the course of the past 50 years, and it is clear that their relationship is no longer tempered by equilibrium. Any forces that US would like to leverage to reorganize the so-called balance will hardly stop China's continued development.Fifty years ago, the US-China relationship made a breakthrough because of the US balancing strategy, and now, 50 years later, the relationship is beginning to ""decouple."" This is because, in US's balanced strategy, it has never seen itself as a party that can be on an equal footing with its so-called rivals, but always calculating how to prevent other countries from challenging its hegemonic position.The author is a senior editor with People's Daily, and currently a senior fellow with the Chongyang Institute for Financial Studies at Renmin University of China. dinggang@globaltimes.com.cn.

313,"All sides should give Russia, Ukraine some space to resolve issue: Global Times editorial",Global Times,2022-02-23,"Russia President Vladimir Putin on Monday signed two decrees recognizing ""the Lugansk (LPR)"" and ""the Donetsk (DPR)"" as independent and sovereign states. Ukraine decided to recall its charge d'affairs in Russia and will reconsider its diplomatic relations with Russia. The sudden change in the Ukraine situation has aroused great concern around the world. In this regard, China State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi said on Tuesday that the legitimate security concerns of any country must be respected, and the purposes and principles of the UN Charter must be upheld. He said China once again called on all parties to exercise restraint, appreciate the importance of implementing the principle of indivisible security, and de-escalate the situation and resolve differences through dialogue and negotiations.It should be noted that it is very regrettable that the Ukraine issue has evolved so far. The US has continued its intensive containment on Russia, which finally forced Russia to try to realize its security demands in such a way. This is the outburst of the dissatisfaction of the party whose security demands have been ignored for a long time since the end of the Cold War. The situation in Ukraine is deteriorating. At this time, the international community cannot discard its efforts for peace and to avoid further escalating the situation.The prospect of the situation between Russia and Ukraine remains highly uncertain. The US and West countries immediately condemned Russia's move. The White House officials said further ""coordinated"" sanctions directed at Russia would be announced on Tuesday. UN Secretary-General António Guterres said Russia's decision is ""a violation of the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Ukraine and inconsistent with the principles of the Charter of the UN."" He called for addressing ""all issues peacefully."" Many countries said they should not give up diplomatic means to peacefully solve the problem and underlined that ""constructive diplomacy is the need of the hour.""The Russia-Ukraine crisis is a dual crisis, in which bilateral conflicts between Russia and Ukraine are intertwined with the strategic suppression that NATO's eastward expansion has brought to Russia. All relevant parties have put forward their own security demands before. Although no consensus was reached, that doesn't necessarily mean a complete breakup of negotiations. It hasn't reached the point that the issue must be solved by war. Whether the situation will further escalate next mainly depends on the scale of the US sanctions imposed on Russia and whether Russia will be provoked to take more aggressive measures.Peace and no war is in the biggest and common interests of all countries in the EU continent. In this sense, only by achieving a soft landing for the Russia-Ukraine crisis can EU realize peace. True security should be inalienable, common, integrated, cooperative and sustainable. This means all sides' security interests should be respected and safeguarded, and if any party's security concerns are ignored or even trampled on, geopolitical disputes will continue and never cease. The knot must be untied by the one who tied it. Russia and Ukraine need to have face-to-face dialogues. The US and NATO should be pulled back from the Russia-Ukraine crisis as much as possible and there should be no more complicated elements added to influence the situation.In particular, at a time when the situation is uncertain, all sides should leave some space for Russia and Ukraine to solve the problems. Confrontation, sanctions, or even a direct battle will not help ease tensions. The flames scattered in eastern Ukraine are reminding all parties of the fact that blindly imposing pressure will only lead to an escalation of conflicts. What is most needed there are restraints and rationality, as well as constructive efforts of the international community.   China has no self-interest in the Ukraine issue. It has always upheld a fair and responsible attitude and will decide its own position based on the merits of the matter itself. Although all parties have different views on the Ukraine crisis, the top priority now is to avoid any actions that could intensify tensions. The international community should reach such a consensus as soon as possible. The development of the Ukraine situation is the result of a series of complex factors. Now that it has come to the brink of a cliff, all parties should work together to pull it back.",OPINION,EDITORIAL,"United Nations Security Council meets after Russia recognized two breakaway regions in eastern Ukraine as independent entities, in New York City on Monday.

317,"EU agrees Russia sanctions package, warns of further action",Xinhua,2022-02-23," The EU (EU) is ready to take further action against Russia if it continues to escalate the crisis, EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen warned here on Tuesday.In a statement, von der Leyen said EU member states had given their political consent to a new package of sanctions against Russia following its recognition of the independence of the Ukraine regions of Donetsk and Luhansk.The package contains a number of ""calibrated measures"" targeting banks that finance the Russia military apparatus and contribute to the destabilization of Ukraine.It also bans trade between the two breakaway regions and the EU, as it did with Crimea in 2014, and limits the Russia government's ability to raise capital on the EU's financial markets.Russia President Vladimir Putin on Monday evening signed decrees recognizing the independence of two self-proclaimed regions in eastern Ukraine's Donbass as ""the Lugansk (LPR)"" and ""the Donetsk (DPR).""Russia has done everything to preserve the territorial integrity of Ukraine by fighting for the implementation of 2015 Minsk agreement, but all the efforts ended up in vain, Vladimir Putin said on Monday.The security crisis occurred due to NATO's eastward expansion, which has led to the loss of mutual trust with Russia, he noted.According to Josep Borrell, EU's High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, the package comprises sanctions against 351 members of the Russia State Duma (lower house of the country's Federal Assembly) who voted to recognize the two regions.The EU will also ""target 27 individuals and entities who are playing a role in undermining or threatening Ukraine's territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence,"" he said.Furthermore, the sanctions aim to target the Russia state's ability to access the EU's capital and financial markets and services.""If Russia continues to escalate this crisis that it has created, we are ready to take further action in response,"" von der Leyen said.On the controversial Russia-Germany Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, von der Leyen said she believed that the Germany government was ""absolutely right"" to stop the project, which must be assessed in light of the security of energy supply for all of EU.""This crisis shows that EU is still too dependent on Russia gas. We have to diversify our suppliers and massively invest in renewables. This is a strategic investment in our energy independence,"" she said.The conflict in eastern Ukraine began in April 2014 with fightings between the Ukraine government troops and local armed groups who seized several towns.With the mediation of the global community, the two sides in Belarus' capital of Minsk reached ceasefire agreements in September 2014 and February 2015 respectively.Russia has been seeking NATO's guarantee to halt eastward expansion. However, U.S. President Joe Biden's administration took a hard line against Russia, supporting Ukraine's efforts to join the U.S.-led military alliance and increasing its military assistance to Ukraine, which has re-escalated tensions in the region.The situation in eastern Ukraine has been getting worse since Feb. 17, as the Ukraine government and local armed groups blamed each other for launching aggressive bombards.",WORLD,EUROPE,"European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen makes a statement on the Ukraine issue in Brussels, Belgium, on Feb. 22, 2022.

Ukraine refused to recognize their self-proclaimed status.Calling Russia's move ""the beginning of a Russia invasion of Ukraine,"" Joe Biden said in remarks delivered from the White House that his administration will impose sanctions on two Russia financial institutions - the VEB and the country's military bank -- as well as on Russia's sovereign debt and three individuals.He explained that the measure ""means we've cut off Russia's government from West financing.

321,"US hardly leads the West out of helplessness, but is in fact the cause",Zhao Minghao,2022-02-23,"The Munich Security Conference 2022 was held under the shadow of multiple challenges including the Ukraine crisis. The Munich Security Index 2022 shows perceptions of risk that pervade the societies of G7 countries due to COVID-19 pandemic, geopolitical tensions, domestic political polarization, and rising inequality. As the Munich Security Report 2022 points out, many West people believe that they are living in a ""new era of successive and interconnected disruptions,"" and there is a growing ""collective helplessness.""Such helplessness comes from domestic political dysfunction. Economic inequality, ethnic tensions, and intergenerational conflicts are old problems that become even worse in a polarized political environment. The stagnation of political reforms has largely contributed to ""crisis fatigue"" within the G7 countries mentioned in the Munich Security Report 2022. People feel less confident in their governments. According to a recent NBC News poll, only 22 percent answered that things are ""headed in the right direction.""The trend toward the retreat of democracy continues, warned Wolfgang Ischinger, chairman of the Munich Security Conference. The ""illiberal movement"" within the West is worsening, and there are challenges like populism and neo-fascism. US leadership in the West has been damaged due to its domestic illiberal movement. During the Joe Biden presidency, the US is more divided under the crisis of democracy. Helplessness stems from the external challenges West countries face, which are often self-imposed. NATO enlargement and the EU's expansion eastward are the key factors influencing Russia's strong responses to the Ukraine crisis, according to John Mearsheimer, professor at the University of Chicago. He pointed out that the Ukraine crisis is the West's fault as the West had been moving into Russia's backyard and threatening its core strategic interests. Indeed, Ukraine has the right to make a choice, but that choice should not expose its neighbor to a major security threat. Given the US and EU interference in Ukraine, it's hard to argue that Kiev's choice is truly ""independent."" Leaked classified documents show that senior US officials like Victoria Nuland, US' current under secretary of state for political affairs, have been weighing in on the make-up of the Ukraine government. For the US, the survival of NATO depends on deliberately created geopolitical tensions. The Obama administration's actions during the Russo-Georgian War and the Joe Biden administration's moves during the recent Ukraine crisis show to the world a rattled US government. ""Helpless"" EU must realize that there is indeed a geopolitical factor. Some EU countries, including Germany, seem to be interested in participating in the geopolitical game in the Indo-Pacific region, following US to provoke Beijing on the Taiwan question. This will bring them into trouble. Another contribution to the West's helplessness is the Afghanistan issue. With the hasty withdrawal of the US troops from Afghanistan, the humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan is getting worse because of the de facto US sanctions against the Taliban. The West does have a sense of frustration over Afghanistan, but it cannot be allowed to shrug off its responsibility in an immoral matter. The West is facing what former EU Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker called a ""polycrisis."" The US is hardly leading the West out of helplessness, and is in fact the cause. As the Munich Security Report 2022 emphasizes, collectively, they have the chance to turn the tide. Individually they risk being swept away. EU needs to make efforts to this end, especially to persuade US not to indulge in confrontations with China and Russia. The author is a senior fellow at the Charhar Institute and China Forum Expert at Tsinghua University. opinion@globaltimes.com.cn",OPINION,VIEWPOINT,"Outgoing Munich Security Conference Chairman Wolfgang Ischinger speaks at the end of the Munich Security Conference (MSC) in Munich, southern Germany, on February 20, 2022.

322,Can US’ balancing strategy last after Ukraine crisis?,Ding Gang,2022-02-23,"On February 21, 1972, US President Richard Nixon came to Beijing to begin a ""world-changing"" visit. He became the first sitting US president to visit China.On February 28, China and the US issued the Shanghai Joint Communiqué, which laid the foundation for the subsequent development of US-China relations.Twenty years ago, in February 2002, I interviewed Dr Kissinger in New York. Over the past two days, I have gone over my notes from that interview and have been filled with emotion.The China-US relationship seems to have gone through a strange circle, from breaking the ice in 1972, to steadily rising to a warm point in 2002, and then beginning to freeze again.The world is also in the midst of dramatic change. From Chairman Mao Zedong's handshake with President Nixon, to former President Donald Trump's ""decoupling"" with, to China-Russia back-to-back partnership today, and the outbreak of the Ukraine crisis, great powers are beginning to reorganize.I clearly remember Dr Kissinger telling me at the time that the breakthrough in the Shanghai Communiqué was largely due to a mutual recognition that establishing direct contacts was possible and in the interest of both sides.Kissinger said President Nixon made the goal of establishing diplomatic relations with China an integral part of his international strategy as soon as he took office. The China side had the same consideration.According to Kissinger, there were also concerns on the China side at the time about the threat from the Soviet Union. Those were the two bases on which the Shanghai Communiqué made its breakthrough. The basic spirit of the communiqué, in his view, was to establish a direct cooperative relationship between the US and China.The two foundations Dr Kissinger spoke of reflect his idea of a balanced strategy. The central idea of his book World Order was that a balance of power based on the Peace of Westphalia was the key to avoiding war and building peace.This idea of strategic balance still influences US's global strategy today, and the adjustment of US policy toward China clearly comes from this idea.In recent years, some in US have insisted that the US-China relationship is headed for a breakdown because China has adopted a more aggressive strategy of foreign expansion, undermining the order that the US has worked on for years to establish in the Asia-Pacific region and is upsetting the global balance of power.Some US scholars also cited Kissinger's advice before Nixon's visit to China 50 years ago.According to declassified documents, Kissinger told Nixon at the time that the US should ""play the balance of power game without any emotion.""Kissinger also predicted that in 20 years, China would be ""even more powerful"" and reminded the US president at that time to consider how to rely on Russia to keep China down.Such a balance of power game is to create a US-led structure to balance the relationship between global powers. Essentially it is not about trying to cooperate with the other side, but to ensure that the US can suppress and dismantle the other side in order to achieve US hegemony. Such a balancing structure will eventually force many small and medium-sized countries to choose sides. The crisis in Ukraine, which has gone so far, is a typical example.However, after China's peaceful rise, such a balancing strategy has become increasingly difficult to achieve. China and the US have become increasingly interdependent over the course of the past 50 years, and it is clear that their relationship is no longer tempered by equilibrium. Any forces that US would like to leverage to reorganize the so-called balance will hardly stop China's continued development.Fifty years ago, the US-China relationship made a breakthrough because of the US balancing strategy, and now, 50 years later, the relationship is beginning to ""decouple."" This is because, in US's balanced strategy, it has never seen itself as a party that can be on an equal footing with its so-called rivals, but always calculating how to prevent other countries from challenging its hegemonic position.The author is a senior editor with People's Daily, and currently a senior fellow with the Chongyang Institute for Financial Studies at Renmin University of China. dinggang@globaltimes.com.cn.

323,"All sides should give Russia, Ukraine some space to resolve issue: Global Times editorial",Global Times,2022-02-23,"Russia President Vladimir Putin on Monday signed two decrees recognizing ""the Lugansk (LPR)"" and ""the Donetsk (DPR)"" as independent and sovereign states. Ukraine decided to recall its charge d'affairs in Russia and will reconsider its diplomatic relations with Russia. The sudden change in the Ukraine situation has aroused great concern around the world. In this regard, China State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi said on Tuesday that the legitimate security concerns of any country must be respected, and the purposes and principles of the UN Charter must be upheld. He said China once again called on all parties to exercise restraint, appreciate the importance of implementing the principle of indivisible security, and de-escalate the situation and resolve differences through dialogue and negotiations.It should be noted that it is very regrettable that the Ukraine issue has evolved so far. The US has continued its intensive containment on Russia, which finally forced Russia to try to realize its security demands in such a way. This is the outburst of the dissatisfaction of the party whose security demands have been ignored for a long time since the end of the Cold War. The situation in Ukraine is deteriorating. At this time, the international community cannot discard its efforts for peace and to avoid further escalating the situation.The prospect of the situation between Russia and Ukraine remains highly uncertain. The US and West countries immediately condemned Russia's move. The White House officials said further ""coordinated"" sanctions directed at Russia would be announced on Tuesday. UN Secretary-General António Guterres said Russia's decision is ""a violation of the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Ukraine and inconsistent with the principles of the Charter of the UN."" He called for addressing ""all issues peacefully."" Many countries said they should not give up diplomatic means to peacefully solve the problem and underlined that ""constructive diplomacy is the need of the hour.""The Russia-Ukraine crisis is a dual crisis, in which bilateral conflicts between Russia and Ukraine are intertwined with the strategic suppression that NATO's eastward expansion has brought to Russia. All relevant parties have put forward their own security demands before. Although no consensus was reached, that doesn't necessarily mean a complete breakup of negotiations. It hasn't reached the point that the issue must be solved by war. Whether the situation will further escalate next mainly depends on the scale of the US sanctions imposed on Russia and whether Russia will be provoked to take more aggressive measures.Peace and no war is in the biggest and common interests of all countries in the EU continent. In this sense, only by achieving a soft landing for the Russia-Ukraine crisis can EU realize peace. True security should be inalienable, common, integrated, cooperative and sustainable. This means all sides' security interests should be respected and safeguarded, and if any party's security concerns are ignored or even trampled on, geopolitical disputes will continue and never cease. The knot must be untied by the one who tied it. Russia and Ukraine need to have face-to-face dialogues. The US and NATO should be pulled back from the Russia-Ukraine crisis as much as possible and there should be no more complicated elements added to influence the situation.In particular, at a time when the situation is uncertain, all sides should leave some space for Russia and Ukraine to solve the problems. Confrontation, sanctions, or even a direct battle will not help ease tensions. The flames scattered in eastern Ukraine are reminding all parties of the fact that blindly imposing pressure will only lead to an escalation of conflicts. What is most needed there are restraints and rationality, as well as constructive efforts of the international community.   China has no self-interest in the Ukraine issue. It has always upheld a fair and responsible attitude and will decide its own position based on the merits of the matter itself. Although all parties have different views on the Ukraine crisis, the top priority now is to avoid any actions that could intensify tensions. The international community should reach such a consensus as soon as possible. The development of the Ukraine situation is the result of a series of complex factors. Now that it has come to the brink of a cliff, all parties should work together to pull it back.",OPINION,EDITORIAL,"United Nations Security Council meets after Russia recognized two breakaway regions in eastern Ukraine as independent entities, in New York City on Monday.

327,"EU agrees Russia sanctions package, warns of further action",Xinhua,2022-02-23," The EU (EU) is ready to take further action against Russia if it continues to escalate the crisis, EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen warned here on Tuesday.In a statement, von der Leyen said EU member states had given their political consent to a new package of sanctions against Russia following its recognition of the independence of the Ukraine regions of Donetsk and Luhansk.The package contains a number of ""calibrated measures"" targeting banks that finance the Russia military apparatus and contribute to the destabilization of Ukraine.It also bans trade between the two breakaway regions and the EU, as it did with Crimea in 2014, and limits the Russia government's ability to raise capital on the EU's financial markets.Russia President Vladimir Putin on Monday evening signed decrees recognizing the independence of two self-proclaimed regions in eastern Ukraine's Donbass as ""the Lugansk (LPR)"" and ""the Donetsk (DPR).""Russia has done everything to preserve the territorial integrity of Ukraine by fighting for the implementation of 2015 Minsk agreement, but all the efforts ended up in vain, Vladimir Putin said on Monday.The security crisis occurred due to NATO's eastward expansion, which has led to the loss of mutual trust with Russia, he noted.According to Josep Borrell, EU's High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, the package comprises sanctions against 351 members of the Russia State Duma (lower house of the country's Federal Assembly) who voted to recognize the two regions.The EU will also ""target 27 individuals and entities who are playing a role in undermining or threatening Ukraine's territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence,"" he said.Furthermore, the sanctions aim to target the Russia state's ability to access the EU's capital and financial markets and services.""If Russia continues to escalate this crisis that it has created, we are ready to take further action in response,"" von der Leyen said.On the controversial Russia-Germany Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, von der Leyen said she believed that the Germany government was ""absolutely right"" to stop the project, which must be assessed in light of the security of energy supply for all of EU.""This crisis shows that EU is still too dependent on Russia gas. We have to diversify our suppliers and massively invest in renewables. This is a strategic investment in our energy independence,"" she said.The conflict in eastern Ukraine began in April 2014 with fightings between the Ukraine government troops and local armed groups who seized several towns.With the mediation of the global community, the two sides in Belarus' capital of Minsk reached ceasefire agreements in September 2014 and February 2015 respectively.Russia has been seeking NATO's guarantee to halt eastward expansion. However, U.S. President Joe Biden's administration took a hard line against Russia, supporting Ukraine's efforts to join the U.S.-led military alliance and increasing its military assistance to Ukraine, which has re-escalated tensions in the region.The situation in eastern Ukraine has been getting worse since Feb. 17, as the Ukraine government and local armed groups blamed each other for launching aggressive bombards.",WORLD,EUROPE,"European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen makes a statement on the Ukraine issue in Brussels, Belgium, on Feb. 22, 2022.

Ukraine refused to recognize their self-proclaimed status.Calling Russia's move ""the beginning of a Russia invasion of Ukraine,"" Joe Biden said in remarks delivered from the White House that his administration will impose sanctions on two Russia financial institutions - the VEB and the country's military bank -- as well as on Russia's sovereign debt and three individuals.He explained that the measure ""means we've cut off Russia's government from West financing.

331,"US hardly leads the West out of helplessness, but is in fact the cause",Zhao Minghao,2022-02-23,"The Munich Security Conference 2022 was held under the shadow of multiple challenges including the Ukraine crisis. The Munich Security Index 2022 shows perceptions of risk that pervade the societies of G7 countries due to COVID-19 pandemic, geopolitical tensions, domestic political polarization, and rising inequality. As the Munich Security Report 2022 points out, many West people believe that they are living in a ""new era of successive and interconnected disruptions,"" and there is a growing ""collective helplessness.""Such helplessness comes from domestic political dysfunction. Economic inequality, ethnic tensions, and intergenerational conflicts are old problems that become even worse in a polarized political environment. The stagnation of political reforms has largely contributed to ""crisis fatigue"" within the G7 countries mentioned in the Munich Security Report 2022. People feel less confident in their governments. According to a recent NBC News poll, only 22 percent answered that things are ""headed in the right direction.""The trend toward the retreat of democracy continues, warned Wolfgang Ischinger, chairman of the Munich Security Conference. The ""illiberal movement"" within the West is worsening, and there are challenges like populism and neo-fascism. US leadership in the West has been damaged due to its domestic illiberal movement. During the Joe Biden presidency, the US is more divided under the crisis of democracy. Helplessness stems from the external challenges West countries face, which are often self-imposed. NATO enlargement and the EU's expansion eastward are the key factors influencing Russia's strong responses to the Ukraine crisis, according to John Mearsheimer, professor at the University of Chicago. He pointed out that the Ukraine crisis is the West's fault as the West had been moving into Russia's backyard and threatening its core strategic interests. Indeed, Ukraine has the right to make a choice, but that choice should not expose its neighbor to a major security threat. Given the US and EU interference in Ukraine, it's hard to argue that Kiev's choice is truly ""independent."" Leaked classified documents show that senior US officials like Victoria Nuland, US' current under secretary of state for political affairs, have been weighing in on the make-up of the Ukraine government. For the US, the survival of NATO depends on deliberately created geopolitical tensions. The Obama administration's actions during the Russo-Georgian War and the Joe Biden administration's moves during the recent Ukraine crisis show to the world a rattled US government. ""Helpless"" EU must realize that there is indeed a geopolitical factor. Some EU countries, including Germany, seem to be interested in participating in the geopolitical game in the Indo-Pacific region, following US to provoke Beijing on the Taiwan question. This will bring them into trouble. Another contribution to the West's helplessness is the Afghanistan issue. With the hasty withdrawal of the US troops from Afghanistan, the humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan is getting worse because of the de facto US sanctions against the Taliban. The West does have a sense of frustration over Afghanistan, but it cannot be allowed to shrug off its responsibility in an immoral matter. The West is facing what former EU Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker called a ""polycrisis."" The US is hardly leading the West out of helplessness, and is in fact the cause. As the Munich Security Report 2022 emphasizes, collectively, they have the chance to turn the tide. Individually they risk being swept away. EU needs to make efforts to this end, especially to persuade US not to indulge in confrontations with China and Russia. The author is a senior fellow at the Charhar Institute and China Forum Expert at Tsinghua University. opinion@globaltimes.com.cn",OPINION,VIEWPOINT,"Outgoing Munich Security Conference Chairman Wolfgang Ischinger speaks at the end of the Munich Security Conference (MSC) in Munich, southern Germany, on February 20, 2022.

332,Can US’ balancing strategy last after Ukraine crisis?,Ding Gang,2022-02-23,"On February 21, 1972, US President Richard Nixon came to Beijing to begin a ""world-changing"" visit. He became the first sitting US president to visit China.On February 28, China and the US issued the Shanghai Joint Communiqué, which laid the foundation for the subsequent development of US-China relations.Twenty years ago, in February 2002, I interviewed Dr Kissinger in New York. Over the past two days, I have gone over my notes from that interview and have been filled with emotion.The China-US relationship seems to have gone through a strange circle, from breaking the ice in 1972, to steadily rising to a warm point in 2002, and then beginning to freeze again.The world is also in the midst of dramatic change. From Chairman Mao Zedong's handshake with President Nixon, to former President Donald Trump's ""decoupling"" with, to China-Russia back-to-back partnership today, and the outbreak of the Ukraine crisis, great powers are beginning to reorganize.I clearly remember Dr Kissinger telling me at the time that the breakthrough in the Shanghai Communiqué was largely due to a mutual recognition that establishing direct contacts was possible and in the interest of both sides.Kissinger said President Nixon made the goal of establishing diplomatic relations with China an integral part of his international strategy as soon as he took office. The China side had the same consideration.According to Kissinger, there were also concerns on the China side at the time about the threat from the Soviet Union. Those were the two bases on which the Shanghai Communiqué made its breakthrough. The basic spirit of the communiqué, in his view, was to establish a direct cooperative relationship between the US and China.The two foundations Dr Kissinger spoke of reflect his idea of a balanced strategy. The central idea of his book World Order was that a balance of power based on the Peace of Westphalia was the key to avoiding war and building peace.This idea of strategic balance still influences US's global strategy today, and the adjustment of US policy toward China clearly comes from this idea.In recent years, some in US have insisted that the US-China relationship is headed for a breakdown because China has adopted a more aggressive strategy of foreign expansion, undermining the order that the US has worked on for years to establish in the Asia-Pacific region and is upsetting the global balance of power.Some US scholars also cited Kissinger's advice before Nixon's visit to China 50 years ago.According to declassified documents, Kissinger told Nixon at the time that the US should ""play the balance of power game without any emotion.""Kissinger also predicted that in 20 years, China would be ""even more powerful"" and reminded the US president at that time to consider how to rely on Russia to keep China down.Such a balance of power game is to create a US-led structure to balance the relationship between global powers. Essentially it is not about trying to cooperate with the other side, but to ensure that the US can suppress and dismantle the other side in order to achieve US hegemony. Such a balancing structure will eventually force many small and medium-sized countries to choose sides. The crisis in Ukraine, which has gone so far, is a typical example.However, after China's peaceful rise, such a balancing strategy has become increasingly difficult to achieve. China and the US have become increasingly interdependent over the course of the past 50 years, and it is clear that their relationship is no longer tempered by equilibrium. Any forces that US would like to leverage to reorganize the so-called balance will hardly stop China's continued development.Fifty years ago, the US-China relationship made a breakthrough because of the US balancing strategy, and now, 50 years later, the relationship is beginning to ""decouple."" This is because, in US's balanced strategy, it has never seen itself as a party that can be on an equal footing with its so-called rivals, but always calculating how to prevent other countries from challenging its hegemonic position.The author is a senior editor with People's Daily, and currently a senior fellow with the Chongyang Institute for Financial Studies at Renmin University of China. dinggang@globaltimes.com.cn.

333,"All sides should give Russia, Ukraine some space to resolve issue: Global Times editorial",Global Times,2022-02-23,"Russia President Vladimir Putin on Monday signed two decrees recognizing ""the Lugansk (LPR)"" and ""the Donetsk (DPR)"" as independent and sovereign states. Ukraine decided to recall its charge d'affairs in Russia and will reconsider its diplomatic relations with Russia. The sudden change in the Ukraine situation has aroused great concern around the world. In this regard, China State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi said on Tuesday that the legitimate security concerns of any country must be respected, and the purposes and principles of the UN Charter must be upheld. He said China once again called on all parties to exercise restraint, appreciate the importance of implementing the principle of indivisible security, and de-escalate the situation and resolve differences through dialogue and negotiations.It should be noted that it is very regrettable that the Ukraine issue has evolved so far. The US has continued its intensive containment on Russia, which finally forced Russia to try to realize its security demands in such a way. This is the outburst of the dissatisfaction of the party whose security demands have been ignored for a long time since the end of the Cold War. The situation in Ukraine is deteriorating. At this time, the international community cannot discard its efforts for peace and to avoid further escalating the situation.The prospect of the situation between Russia and Ukraine remains highly uncertain. The US and West countries immediately condemned Russia's move. The White House officials said further ""coordinated"" sanctions directed at Russia would be announced on Tuesday. UN Secretary-General António Guterres said Russia's decision is ""a violation of the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Ukraine and inconsistent with the principles of the Charter of the UN."" He called for addressing ""all issues peacefully."" Many countries said they should not give up diplomatic means to peacefully solve the problem and underlined that ""constructive diplomacy is the need of the hour.""The Russia-Ukraine crisis is a dual crisis, in which bilateral conflicts between Russia and Ukraine are intertwined with the strategic suppression that NATO's eastward expansion has brought to Russia. All relevant parties have put forward their own security demands before. Although no consensus was reached, that doesn't necessarily mean a complete breakup of negotiations. It hasn't reached the point that the issue must be solved by war. Whether the situation will further escalate next mainly depends on the scale of the US sanctions imposed on Russia and whether Russia will be provoked to take more aggressive measures.Peace and no war is in the biggest and common interests of all countries in the EU continent. In this sense, only by achieving a soft landing for the Russia-Ukraine crisis can EU realize peace. True security should be inalienable, common, integrated, cooperative and sustainable. This means all sides' security interests should be respected and safeguarded, and if any party's security concerns are ignored or even trampled on, geopolitical disputes will continue and never cease. The knot must be untied by the one who tied it. Russia and Ukraine need to have face-to-face dialogues. The US and NATO should be pulled back from the Russia-Ukraine crisis as much as possible and there should be no more complicated elements added to influence the situation.In particular, at a time when the situation is uncertain, all sides should leave some space for Russia and Ukraine to solve the problems. Confrontation, sanctions, or even a direct battle will not help ease tensions. The flames scattered in eastern Ukraine are reminding all parties of the fact that blindly imposing pressure will only lead to an escalation of conflicts. What is most needed there are restraints and rationality, as well as constructive efforts of the international community.   China has no self-interest in the Ukraine issue. It has always upheld a fair and responsible attitude and will decide its own position based on the merits of the matter itself. Although all parties have different views on the Ukraine crisis, the top priority now is to avoid any actions that could intensify tensions. The international community should reach such a consensus as soon as possible. The development of the Ukraine situation is the result of a series of complex factors. Now that it has come to the brink of a cliff, all parties should work together to pull it back.",OPINION,EDITORIAL,"United Nations Security Council meets after Russia recognized two breakaway regions in eastern Ukraine as independent entities, in New York City on Monday.

337,"EU agrees Russia sanctions package, warns of further action",Xinhua,2022-02-23," The EU (EU) is ready to take further action against Russia if it continues to escalate the crisis, EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen warned here on Tuesday.In a statement, von der Leyen said EU member states had given their political consent to a new package of sanctions against Russia following its recognition of the independence of the Ukraine regions of Donetsk and Luhansk.The package contains a number of ""calibrated measures"" targeting banks that finance the Russia military apparatus and contribute to the destabilization of Ukraine.It also bans trade between the two breakaway regions and the EU, as it did with Crimea in 2014, and limits the Russia government's ability to raise capital on the EU's financial markets.Russia President Vladimir Putin on Monday evening signed decrees recognizing the independence of two self-proclaimed regions in eastern Ukraine's Donbass as ""the Lugansk (LPR)"" and ""the Donetsk (DPR).""Russia has done everything to preserve the territorial integrity of Ukraine by fighting for the implementation of 2015 Minsk agreement, but all the efforts ended up in vain, Vladimir Putin said on Monday.The security crisis occurred due to NATO's eastward expansion, which has led to the loss of mutual trust with Russia, he noted.According to Josep Borrell, EU's High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, the package comprises sanctions against 351 members of the Russia State Duma (lower house of the country's Federal Assembly) who voted to recognize the two regions.The EU will also ""target 27 individuals and entities who are playing a role in undermining or threatening Ukraine's territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence,"" he said.Furthermore, the sanctions aim to target the Russia state's ability to access the EU's capital and financial markets and services.""If Russia continues to escalate this crisis that it has created, we are ready to take further action in response,"" von der Leyen said.On the controversial Russia-Germany Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, von der Leyen said she believed that the Germany government was ""absolutely right"" to stop the project, which must be assessed in light of the security of energy supply for all of EU.""This crisis shows that EU is still too dependent on Russia gas. We have to diversify our suppliers and massively invest in renewables. This is a strategic investment in our energy independence,"" she said.The conflict in eastern Ukraine began in April 2014 with fightings between the Ukraine government troops and local armed groups who seized several towns.With the mediation of the global community, the two sides in Belarus' capital of Minsk reached ceasefire agreements in September 2014 and February 2015 respectively.Russia has been seeking NATO's guarantee to halt eastward expansion. However, U.S. President Joe Biden's administration took a hard line against Russia, supporting Ukraine's efforts to join the U.S.-led military alliance and increasing its military assistance to Ukraine, which has re-escalated tensions in the region.The situation in eastern Ukraine has been getting worse since Feb. 17, as the Ukraine government and local armed groups blamed each other for launching aggressive bombards.",WORLD,EUROPE,"European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen makes a statement on the Ukraine issue in Brussels, Belgium, on Feb. 22, 2022.

Ukraine refused to recognize their self-proclaimed status.Calling Russia's move ""the beginning of a Russia invasion of Ukraine,"" Joe Biden said in remarks delivered from the White House that his administration will impose sanctions on two Russia financial institutions - the VEB and the country's military bank -- as well as on Russia's sovereign debt and three individuals.He explained that the measure ""means we've cut off Russia's government from West financing.

341,"US hardly leads the West out of helplessness, but is in fact the cause",Zhao Minghao,2022-02-23,"The Munich Security Conference 2022 was held under the shadow of multiple challenges including the Ukraine crisis. The Munich Security Index 2022 shows perceptions of risk that pervade the societies of G7 countries due to COVID-19 pandemic, geopolitical tensions, domestic political polarization, and rising inequality. As the Munich Security Report 2022 points out, many West people believe that they are living in a ""new era of successive and interconnected disruptions,"" and there is a growing ""collective helplessness.""Such helplessness comes from domestic political dysfunction. Economic inequality, ethnic tensions, and intergenerational conflicts are old problems that become even worse in a polarized political environment. The stagnation of political reforms has largely contributed to ""crisis fatigue"" within the G7 countries mentioned in the Munich Security Report 2022. People feel less confident in their governments. According to a recent NBC News poll, only 22 percent answered that things are ""headed in the right direction.""The trend toward the retreat of democracy continues, warned Wolfgang Ischinger, chairman of the Munich Security Conference. The ""illiberal movement"" within the West is worsening, and there are challenges like populism and neo-fascism. US leadership in the West has been damaged due to its domestic illiberal movement. During the Joe Biden presidency, the US is more divided under the crisis of democracy. Helplessness stems from the external challenges West countries face, which are often self-imposed. NATO enlargement and the EU's expansion eastward are the key factors influencing Russia's strong responses to the Ukraine crisis, according to John Mearsheimer, professor at the University of Chicago. He pointed out that the Ukraine crisis is the West's fault as the West had been moving into Russia's backyard and threatening its core strategic interests. Indeed, Ukraine has the right to make a choice, but that choice should not expose its neighbor to a major security threat. Given the US and EU interference in Ukraine, it's hard to argue that Kiev's choice is truly ""independent."" Leaked classified documents show that senior US officials like Victoria Nuland, US' current under secretary of state for political affairs, have been weighing in on the make-up of the Ukraine government. For the US, the survival of NATO depends on deliberately created geopolitical tensions. The Obama administration's actions during the Russo-Georgian War and the Joe Biden administration's moves during the recent Ukraine crisis show to the world a rattled US government. ""Helpless"" EU must realize that there is indeed a geopolitical factor. Some EU countries, including Germany, seem to be interested in participating in the geopolitical game in the Indo-Pacific region, following US to provoke Beijing on the Taiwan question. This will bring them into trouble. Another contribution to the West's helplessness is the Afghanistan issue. With the hasty withdrawal of the US troops from Afghanistan, the humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan is getting worse because of the de facto US sanctions against the Taliban. The West does have a sense of frustration over Afghanistan, but it cannot be allowed to shrug off its responsibility in an immoral matter. The West is facing what former EU Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker called a ""polycrisis."" The US is hardly leading the West out of helplessness, and is in fact the cause. As the Munich Security Report 2022 emphasizes, collectively, they have the chance to turn the tide. Individually they risk being swept away. EU needs to make efforts to this end, especially to persuade US not to indulge in confrontations with China and Russia. The author is a senior fellow at the Charhar Institute and China Forum Expert at Tsinghua University. opinion@globaltimes.com.cn",OPINION,VIEWPOINT,"Outgoing Munich Security Conference Chairman Wolfgang Ischinger speaks at the end of the Munich Security Conference (MSC) in Munich, southern Germany, on February 20, 2022.

342,Can US’ balancing strategy last after Ukraine crisis?,Ding Gang,2022-02-23,"On February 21, 1972, US President Richard Nixon came to Beijing to begin a ""world-changing"" visit. He became the first sitting US president to visit China.On February 28, China and the US issued the Shanghai Joint Communiqué, which laid the foundation for the subsequent development of US-China relations.Twenty years ago, in February 2002, I interviewed Dr Kissinger in New York. Over the past two days, I have gone over my notes from that interview and have been filled with emotion.The China-US relationship seems to have gone through a strange circle, from breaking the ice in 1972, to steadily rising to a warm point in 2002, and then beginning to freeze again.The world is also in the midst of dramatic change. From Chairman Mao Zedong's handshake with President Nixon, to former President Donald Trump's ""decoupling"" with, to China-Russia back-to-back partnership today, and the outbreak of the Ukraine crisis, great powers are beginning to reorganize.I clearly remember Dr Kissinger telling me at the time that the breakthrough in the Shanghai Communiqué was largely due to a mutual recognition that establishing direct contacts was possible and in the interest of both sides.Kissinger said President Nixon made the goal of establishing diplomatic relations with China an integral part of his international strategy as soon as he took office. The China side had the same consideration.According to Kissinger, there were also concerns on the China side at the time about the threat from the Soviet Union. Those were the two bases on which the Shanghai Communiqué made its breakthrough. The basic spirit of the communiqué, in his view, was to establish a direct cooperative relationship between the US and China.The two foundations Dr Kissinger spoke of reflect his idea of a balanced strategy. The central idea of his book World Order was that a balance of power based on the Peace of Westphalia was the key to avoiding war and building peace.This idea of strategic balance still influences US's global strategy today, and the adjustment of US policy toward China clearly comes from this idea.In recent years, some in US have insisted that the US-China relationship is headed for a breakdown because China has adopted a more aggressive strategy of foreign expansion, undermining the order that the US has worked on for years to establish in the Asia-Pacific region and is upsetting the global balance of power.Some US scholars also cited Kissinger's advice before Nixon's visit to China 50 years ago.According to declassified documents, Kissinger told Nixon at the time that the US should ""play the balance of power game without any emotion.""Kissinger also predicted that in 20 years, China would be ""even more powerful"" and reminded the US president at that time to consider how to rely on Russia to keep China down.Such a balance of power game is to create a US-led structure to balance the relationship between global powers. Essentially it is not about trying to cooperate with the other side, but to ensure that the US can suppress and dismantle the other side in order to achieve US hegemony. Such a balancing structure will eventually force many small and medium-sized countries to choose sides. The crisis in Ukraine, which has gone so far, is a typical example.However, after China's peaceful rise, such a balancing strategy has become increasingly difficult to achieve. China and the US have become increasingly interdependent over the course of the past 50 years, and it is clear that their relationship is no longer tempered by equilibrium. Any forces that US would like to leverage to reorganize the so-called balance will hardly stop China's continued development.Fifty years ago, the US-China relationship made a breakthrough because of the US balancing strategy, and now, 50 years later, the relationship is beginning to ""decouple."" This is because, in US's balanced strategy, it has never seen itself as a party that can be on an equal footing with its so-called rivals, but always calculating how to prevent other countries from challenging its hegemonic position.The author is a senior editor with People's Daily, and currently a senior fellow with the Chongyang Institute for Financial Studies at Renmin University of China. dinggang@globaltimes.com.cn.

343,"All sides should give Russia, Ukraine some space to resolve issue: Global Times editorial",Global Times,2022-02-23,"Russia President Vladimir Putin on Monday signed two decrees recognizing ""the Lugansk (LPR)"" and ""the Donetsk (DPR)"" as independent and sovereign states. Ukraine decided to recall its charge d'affairs in Russia and will reconsider its diplomatic relations with Russia. The sudden change in the Ukraine situation has aroused great concern around the world. In this regard, China State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi said on Tuesday that the legitimate security concerns of any country must be respected, and the purposes and principles of the UN Charter must be upheld. He said China once again called on all parties to exercise restraint, appreciate the importance of implementing the principle of indivisible security, and de-escalate the situation and resolve differences through dialogue and negotiations.It should be noted that it is very regrettable that the Ukraine issue has evolved so far. The US has continued its intensive containment on Russia, which finally forced Russia to try to realize its security demands in such a way. This is the outburst of the dissatisfaction of the party whose security demands have been ignored for a long time since the end of the Cold War. The situation in Ukraine is deteriorating. At this time, the international community cannot discard its efforts for peace and to avoid further escalating the situation.The prospect of the situation between Russia and Ukraine remains highly uncertain. The US and West countries immediately condemned Russia's move. The White House officials said further ""coordinated"" sanctions directed at Russia would be announced on Tuesday. UN Secretary-General António Guterres said Russia's decision is ""a violation of the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Ukraine and inconsistent with the principles of the Charter of the UN."" He called for addressing ""all issues peacefully."" Many countries said they should not give up diplomatic means to peacefully solve the problem and underlined that ""constructive diplomacy is the need of the hour.""The Russia-Ukraine crisis is a dual crisis, in which bilateral conflicts between Russia and Ukraine are intertwined with the strategic suppression that NATO's eastward expansion has brought to Russia. All relevant parties have put forward their own security demands before. Although no consensus was reached, that doesn't necessarily mean a complete breakup of negotiations. It hasn't reached the point that the issue must be solved by war. Whether the situation will further escalate next mainly depends on the scale of the US sanctions imposed on Russia and whether Russia will be provoked to take more aggressive measures.Peace and no war is in the biggest and common interests of all countries in the EU continent. In this sense, only by achieving a soft landing for the Russia-Ukraine crisis can EU realize peace. True security should be inalienable, common, integrated, cooperative and sustainable. This means all sides' security interests should be respected and safeguarded, and if any party's security concerns are ignored or even trampled on, geopolitical disputes will continue and never cease. The knot must be untied by the one who tied it. Russia and Ukraine need to have face-to-face dialogues. The US and NATO should be pulled back from the Russia-Ukraine crisis as much as possible and there should be no more complicated elements added to influence the situation.In particular, at a time when the situation is uncertain, all sides should leave some space for Russia and Ukraine to solve the problems. Confrontation, sanctions, or even a direct battle will not help ease tensions. The flames scattered in eastern Ukraine are reminding all parties of the fact that blindly imposing pressure will only lead to an escalation of conflicts. What is most needed there are restraints and rationality, as well as constructive efforts of the international community.   China has no self-interest in the Ukraine issue. It has always upheld a fair and responsible attitude and will decide its own position based on the merits of the matter itself. Although all parties have different views on the Ukraine crisis, the top priority now is to avoid any actions that could intensify tensions. The international community should reach such a consensus as soon as possible. The development of the Ukraine situation is the result of a series of complex factors. Now that it has come to the brink of a cliff, all parties should work together to pull it back.",OPINION,EDITORIAL,"United Nations Security Council meets after Russia recognized two breakaway regions in eastern Ukraine as independent entities, in New York City on Monday.

347,"EU agrees Russia sanctions package, warns of further action",Xinhua,2022-02-23," The EU (EU) is ready to take further action against Russia if it continues to escalate the crisis, EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen warned here on Tuesday.In a statement, von der Leyen said EU member states had given their political consent to a new package of sanctions against Russia following its recognition of the independence of the Ukraine regions of Donetsk and Luhansk.The package contains a number of ""calibrated measures"" targeting banks that finance the Russia military apparatus and contribute to the destabilization of Ukraine.It also bans trade between the two breakaway regions and the EU, as it did with Crimea in 2014, and limits the Russia government's ability to raise capital on the EU's financial markets.Russia President Vladimir Putin on Monday evening signed decrees recognizing the independence of two self-proclaimed regions in eastern Ukraine's Donbass as ""the Lugansk (LPR)"" and ""the Donetsk (DPR).""Russia has done everything to preserve the territorial integrity of Ukraine by fighting for the implementation of 2015 Minsk agreement, but all the efforts ended up in vain, Vladimir Putin said on Monday.The security crisis occurred due to NATO's eastward expansion, which has led to the loss of mutual trust with Russia, he noted.According to Josep Borrell, EU's High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, the package comprises sanctions against 351 members of the Russia State Duma (lower house of the country's Federal Assembly) who voted to recognize the two regions.The EU will also ""target 27 individuals and entities who are playing a role in undermining or threatening Ukraine's territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence,"" he said.Furthermore, the sanctions aim to target the Russia state's ability to access the EU's capital and financial markets and services.""If Russia continues to escalate this crisis that it has created, we are ready to take further action in response,"" von der Leyen said.On the controversial Russia-Germany Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, von der Leyen said she believed that the Germany government was ""absolutely right"" to stop the project, which must be assessed in light of the security of energy supply for all of EU.""This crisis shows that EU is still too dependent on Russia gas. We have to diversify our suppliers and massively invest in renewables. This is a strategic investment in our energy independence,"" she said.The conflict in eastern Ukraine began in April 2014 with fightings between the Ukraine government troops and local armed groups who seized several towns.With the mediation of the global community, the two sides in Belarus' capital of Minsk reached ceasefire agreements in September 2014 and February 2015 respectively.Russia has been seeking NATO's guarantee to halt eastward expansion. However, U.S. President Joe Biden's administration took a hard line against Russia, supporting Ukraine's efforts to join the U.S.-led military alliance and increasing its military assistance to Ukraine, which has re-escalated tensions in the region.The situation in eastern Ukraine has been getting worse since Feb. 17, as the Ukraine government and local armed groups blamed each other for launching aggressive bombards.",WORLD,EUROPE,"European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen makes a statement on the Ukraine issue in Brussels, Belgium, on Feb. 22, 2022.

Ukraine refused to recognize their self-proclaimed status.Calling Russia's move ""the beginning of a Russia invasion of Ukraine,"" Joe Biden said in remarks delivered from the White House that his administration will impose sanctions on two Russia financial institutions - the VEB and the country's military bank -- as well as on Russia's sovereign debt and three individuals.He explained that the measure ""means we've cut off Russia's government from West financing.

351,"US hardly leads the West out of helplessness, but is in fact the cause",Zhao Minghao,2022-02-23,"The Munich Security Conference 2022 was held under the shadow of multiple challenges including the Ukraine crisis. The Munich Security Index 2022 shows perceptions of risk that pervade the societies of G7 countries due to COVID-19 pandemic, geopolitical tensions, domestic political polarization, and rising inequality. As the Munich Security Report 2022 points out, many West people believe that they are living in a ""new era of successive and interconnected disruptions,"" and there is a growing ""collective helplessness.""Such helplessness comes from domestic political dysfunction. Economic inequality, ethnic tensions, and intergenerational conflicts are old problems that become even worse in a polarized political environment. The stagnation of political reforms has largely contributed to ""crisis fatigue"" within the G7 countries mentioned in the Munich Security Report 2022. People feel less confident in their governments. According to a recent NBC News poll, only 22 percent answered that things are ""headed in the right direction.""The trend toward the retreat of democracy continues, warned Wolfgang Ischinger, chairman of the Munich Security Conference. The ""illiberal movement"" within the West is worsening, and there are challenges like populism and neo-fascism. US leadership in the West has been damaged due to its domestic illiberal movement. During the Joe Biden presidency, the US is more divided under the crisis of democracy. Helplessness stems from the external challenges West countries face, which are often self-imposed. NATO enlargement and the EU's expansion eastward are the key factors influencing Russia's strong responses to the Ukraine crisis, according to John Mearsheimer, professor at the University of Chicago. He pointed out that the Ukraine crisis is the West's fault as the West had been moving into Russia's backyard and threatening its core strategic interests. Indeed, Ukraine has the right to make a choice, but that choice should not expose its neighbor to a major security threat. Given the US and EU interference in Ukraine, it's hard to argue that Kiev's choice is truly ""independent."" Leaked classified documents show that senior US officials like Victoria Nuland, US' current under secretary of state for political affairs, have been weighing in on the make-up of the Ukraine government. For the US, the survival of NATO depends on deliberately created geopolitical tensions. The Obama administration's actions during the Russo-Georgian War and the Joe Biden administration's moves during the recent Ukraine crisis show to the world a rattled US government. ""Helpless"" EU must realize that there is indeed a geopolitical factor. Some EU countries, including Germany, seem to be interested in participating in the geopolitical game in the Indo-Pacific region, following US to provoke Beijing on the Taiwan question. This will bring them into trouble. Another contribution to the West's helplessness is the Afghanistan issue. With the hasty withdrawal of the US troops from Afghanistan, the humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan is getting worse because of the de facto US sanctions against the Taliban. The West does have a sense of frustration over Afghanistan, but it cannot be allowed to shrug off its responsibility in an immoral matter. The West is facing what former EU Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker called a ""polycrisis."" The US is hardly leading the West out of helplessness, and is in fact the cause. As the Munich Security Report 2022 emphasizes, collectively, they have the chance to turn the tide. Individually they risk being swept away. EU needs to make efforts to this end, especially to persuade US not to indulge in confrontations with China and Russia. The author is a senior fellow at the Charhar Institute and China Forum Expert at Tsinghua University. opinion@globaltimes.com.cn",OPINION,VIEWPOINT,"Outgoing Munich Security Conference Chairman Wolfgang Ischinger speaks at the end of the Munich Security Conference (MSC) in Munich, southern Germany, on February 20, 2022.

352,Can US’ balancing strategy last after Ukraine crisis?,Ding Gang,2022-02-23,"On February 21, 1972, US President Richard Nixon came to Beijing to begin a ""world-changing"" visit. He became the first sitting US president to visit China.On February 28, China and the US issued the Shanghai Joint Communiqué, which laid the foundation for the subsequent development of US-China relations.Twenty years ago, in February 2002, I interviewed Dr Kissinger in New York. Over the past two days, I have gone over my notes from that interview and have been filled with emotion.The China-US relationship seems to have gone through a strange circle, from breaking the ice in 1972, to steadily rising to a warm point in 2002, and then beginning to freeze again.The world is also in the midst of dramatic change. From Chairman Mao Zedong's handshake with President Nixon, to former President Donald Trump's ""decoupling"" with, to China-Russia back-to-back partnership today, and the outbreak of the Ukraine crisis, great powers are beginning to reorganize.I clearly remember Dr Kissinger telling me at the time that the breakthrough in the Shanghai Communiqué was largely due to a mutual recognition that establishing direct contacts was possible and in the interest of both sides.Kissinger said President Nixon made the goal of establishing diplomatic relations with China an integral part of his international strategy as soon as he took office. The China side had the same consideration.According to Kissinger, there were also concerns on the China side at the time about the threat from the Soviet Union. Those were the two bases on which the Shanghai Communiqué made its breakthrough. The basic spirit of the communiqué, in his view, was to establish a direct cooperative relationship between the US and China.The two foundations Dr Kissinger spoke of reflect his idea of a balanced strategy. The central idea of his book World Order was that a balance of power based on the Peace of Westphalia was the key to avoiding war and building peace.This idea of strategic balance still influences US's global strategy today, and the adjustment of US policy toward China clearly comes from this idea.In recent years, some in US have insisted that the US-China relationship is headed for a breakdown because China has adopted a more aggressive strategy of foreign expansion, undermining the order that the US has worked on for years to establish in the Asia-Pacific region and is upsetting the global balance of power.Some US scholars also cited Kissinger's advice before Nixon's visit to China 50 years ago.According to declassified documents, Kissinger told Nixon at the time that the US should ""play the balance of power game without any emotion.""Kissinger also predicted that in 20 years, China would be ""even more powerful"" and reminded the US president at that time to consider how to rely on Russia to keep China down.Such a balance of power game is to create a US-led structure to balance the relationship between global powers. Essentially it is not about trying to cooperate with the other side, but to ensure that the US can suppress and dismantle the other side in order to achieve US hegemony. Such a balancing structure will eventually force many small and medium-sized countries to choose sides. The crisis in Ukraine, which has gone so far, is a typical example.However, after China's peaceful rise, such a balancing strategy has become increasingly difficult to achieve. China and the US have become increasingly interdependent over the course of the past 50 years, and it is clear that their relationship is no longer tempered by equilibrium. Any forces that US would like to leverage to reorganize the so-called balance will hardly stop China's continued development.Fifty years ago, the US-China relationship made a breakthrough because of the US balancing strategy, and now, 50 years later, the relationship is beginning to ""decouple."" This is because, in US's balanced strategy, it has never seen itself as a party that can be on an equal footing with its so-called rivals, but always calculating how to prevent other countries from challenging its hegemonic position.The author is a senior editor with People's Daily, and currently a senior fellow with the Chongyang Institute for Financial Studies at Renmin University of China. dinggang@globaltimes.com.cn.

353,"All sides should give Russia, Ukraine some space to resolve issue: Global Times editorial",Global Times,2022-02-23,"Russia President Vladimir Putin on Monday signed two decrees recognizing ""the Lugansk (LPR)"" and ""the Donetsk (DPR)"" as independent and sovereign states. Ukraine decided to recall its charge d'affairs in Russia and will reconsider its diplomatic relations with Russia. The sudden change in the Ukraine situation has aroused great concern around the world. In this regard, China State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi said on Tuesday that the legitimate security concerns of any country must be respected, and the purposes and principles of the UN Charter must be upheld. He said China once again called on all parties to exercise restraint, appreciate the importance of implementing the principle of indivisible security, and de-escalate the situation and resolve differences through dialogue and negotiations.It should be noted that it is very regrettable that the Ukraine issue has evolved so far. The US has continued its intensive containment on Russia, which finally forced Russia to try to realize its security demands in such a way. This is the outburst of the dissatisfaction of the party whose security demands have been ignored for a long time since the end of the Cold War. The situation in Ukraine is deteriorating. At this time, the international community cannot discard its efforts for peace and to avoid further escalating the situation.The prospect of the situation between Russia and Ukraine remains highly uncertain. The US and West countries immediately condemned Russia's move. The White House officials said further ""coordinated"" sanctions directed at Russia would be announced on Tuesday. UN Secretary-General António Guterres said Russia's decision is ""a violation of the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Ukraine and inconsistent with the principles of the Charter of the UN."" He called for addressing ""all issues peacefully."" Many countries said they should not give up diplomatic means to peacefully solve the problem and underlined that ""constructive diplomacy is the need of the hour.""The Russia-Ukraine crisis is a dual crisis, in which bilateral conflicts between Russia and Ukraine are intertwined with the strategic suppression that NATO's eastward expansion has brought to Russia. All relevant parties have put forward their own security demands before. Although no consensus was reached, that doesn't necessarily mean a complete breakup of negotiations. It hasn't reached the point that the issue must be solved by war. Whether the situation will further escalate next mainly depends on the scale of the US sanctions imposed on Russia and whether Russia will be provoked to take more aggressive measures.Peace and no war is in the biggest and common interests of all countries in the EU continent. In this sense, only by achieving a soft landing for the Russia-Ukraine crisis can EU realize peace. True security should be inalienable, common, integrated, cooperative and sustainable. This means all sides' security interests should be respected and safeguarded, and if any party's security concerns are ignored or even trampled on, geopolitical disputes will continue and never cease. The knot must be untied by the one who tied it. Russia and Ukraine need to have face-to-face dialogues. The US and NATO should be pulled back from the Russia-Ukraine crisis as much as possible and there should be no more complicated elements added to influence the situation.In particular, at a time when the situation is uncertain, all sides should leave some space for Russia and Ukraine to solve the problems. Confrontation, sanctions, or even a direct battle will not help ease tensions. The flames scattered in eastern Ukraine are reminding all parties of the fact that blindly imposing pressure will only lead to an escalation of conflicts. What is most needed there are restraints and rationality, as well as constructive efforts of the international community.   China has no self-interest in the Ukraine issue. It has always upheld a fair and responsible attitude and will decide its own position based on the merits of the matter itself. Although all parties have different views on the Ukraine crisis, the top priority now is to avoid any actions that could intensify tensions. The international community should reach such a consensus as soon as possible. The development of the Ukraine situation is the result of a series of complex factors. Now that it has come to the brink of a cliff, all parties should work together to pull it back.",OPINION,EDITORIAL,"United Nations Security Council meets after Russia recognized two breakaway regions in eastern Ukraine as independent entities, in New York City on Monday.

357,"EU agrees Russia sanctions package, warns of further action",Xinhua,2022-02-23," The EU (EU) is ready to take further action against Russia if it continues to escalate the crisis, EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen warned here on Tuesday.In a statement, von der Leyen said EU member states had given their political consent to a new package of sanctions against Russia following its recognition of the independence of the Ukraine regions of Donetsk and Luhansk.The package contains a number of ""calibrated measures"" targeting banks that finance the Russia military apparatus and contribute to the destabilization of Ukraine.It also bans trade between the two breakaway regions and the EU, as it did with Crimea in 2014, and limits the Russia government's ability to raise capital on the EU's financial markets.Russia President Vladimir Putin on Monday evening signed decrees recognizing the independence of two self-proclaimed regions in eastern Ukraine's Donbass as ""the Lugansk (LPR)"" and ""the Donetsk (DPR).""Russia has done everything to preserve the territorial integrity of Ukraine by fighting for the implementation of 2015 Minsk agreement, but all the efforts ended up in vain, Vladimir Putin said on Monday.The security crisis occurred due to NATO's eastward expansion, which has led to the loss of mutual trust with Russia, he noted.According to Josep Borrell, EU's High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, the package comprises sanctions against 351 members of the Russia State Duma (lower house of the country's Federal Assembly) who voted to recognize the two regions.The EU will also ""target 27 individuals and entities who are playing a role in undermining or threatening Ukraine's territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence,"" he said.Furthermore, the sanctions aim to target the Russia state's ability to access the EU's capital and financial markets and services.""If Russia continues to escalate this crisis that it has created, we are ready to take further action in response,"" von der Leyen said.On the controversial Russia-Germany Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, von der Leyen said she believed that the Germany government was ""absolutely right"" to stop the project, which must be assessed in light of the security of energy supply for all of EU.""This crisis shows that EU is still too dependent on Russia gas. We have to diversify our suppliers and massively invest in renewables. This is a strategic investment in our energy independence,"" she said.The conflict in eastern Ukraine began in April 2014 with fightings between the Ukraine government troops and local armed groups who seized several towns.With the mediation of the global community, the two sides in Belarus' capital of Minsk reached ceasefire agreements in September 2014 and February 2015 respectively.Russia has been seeking NATO's guarantee to halt eastward expansion. However, U.S. President Joe Biden's administration took a hard line against Russia, supporting Ukraine's efforts to join the U.S.-led military alliance and increasing its military assistance to Ukraine, which has re-escalated tensions in the region.The situation in eastern Ukraine has been getting worse since Feb. 17, as the Ukraine government and local armed groups blamed each other for launching aggressive bombards.",WORLD,EUROPE,"European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen makes a statement on the Ukraine issue in Brussels, Belgium, on Feb. 22, 2022.

Ukraine refused to recognize their self-proclaimed status.Calling Russia's move ""the beginning of a Russia invasion of Ukraine,"" Joe Biden said in remarks delivered from the White House that his administration will impose sanctions on two Russia financial institutions - the VEB and the country's military bank -- as well as on Russia's sovereign debt and three individuals.He explained that the measure ""means we've cut off Russia's government from West financing.

361,"US hardly leads the West out of helplessness, but is in fact the cause",Zhao Minghao,2022-02-23,"The Munich Security Conference 2022 was held under the shadow of multiple challenges including the Ukraine crisis. The Munich Security Index 2022 shows perceptions of risk that pervade the societies of G7 countries due to COVID-19 pandemic, geopolitical tensions, domestic political polarization, and rising inequality. As the Munich Security Report 2022 points out, many West people believe that they are living in a ""new era of successive and interconnected disruptions,"" and there is a growing ""collective helplessness.""Such helplessness comes from domestic political dysfunction. Economic inequality, ethnic tensions, and intergenerational conflicts are old problems that become even worse in a polarized political environment. The stagnation of political reforms has largely contributed to ""crisis fatigue"" within the G7 countries mentioned in the Munich Security Report 2022. People feel less confident in their governments. According to a recent NBC News poll, only 22 percent answered that things are ""headed in the right direction.""The trend toward the retreat of democracy continues, warned Wolfgang Ischinger, chairman of the Munich Security Conference. The ""illiberal movement"" within the West is worsening, and there are challenges like populism and neo-fascism. US leadership in the West has been damaged due to its domestic illiberal movement. During the Joe Biden presidency, the US is more divided under the crisis of democracy. Helplessness stems from the external challenges West countries face, which are often self-imposed. NATO enlargement and the EU's expansion eastward are the key factors influencing Russia's strong responses to the Ukraine crisis, according to John Mearsheimer, professor at the University of Chicago. He pointed out that the Ukraine crisis is the West's fault as the West had been moving into Russia's backyard and threatening its core strategic interests. Indeed, Ukraine has the right to make a choice, but that choice should not expose its neighbor to a major security threat. Given the US and EU interference in Ukraine, it's hard to argue that Kiev's choice is truly ""independent."" Leaked classified documents show that senior US officials like Victoria Nuland, US' current under secretary of state for political affairs, have been weighing in on the make-up of the Ukraine government. For the US, the survival of NATO depends on deliberately created geopolitical tensions. The Obama administration's actions during the Russo-Georgian War and the Joe Biden administration's moves during the recent Ukraine crisis show to the world a rattled US government. ""Helpless"" EU must realize that there is indeed a geopolitical factor. Some EU countries, including Germany, seem to be interested in participating in the geopolitical game in the Indo-Pacific region, following US to provoke Beijing on the Taiwan question. This will bring them into trouble. Another contribution to the West's helplessness is the Afghanistan issue. With the hasty withdrawal of the US troops from Afghanistan, the humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan is getting worse because of the de facto US sanctions against the Taliban. The West does have a sense of frustration over Afghanistan, but it cannot be allowed to shrug off its responsibility in an immoral matter. The West is facing what former EU Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker called a ""polycrisis."" The US is hardly leading the West out of helplessness, and is in fact the cause. As the Munich Security Report 2022 emphasizes, collectively, they have the chance to turn the tide. Individually they risk being swept away. EU needs to make efforts to this end, especially to persuade US not to indulge in confrontations with China and Russia. The author is a senior fellow at the Charhar Institute and China Forum Expert at Tsinghua University. opinion@globaltimes.com.cn",OPINION,VIEWPOINT,"Outgoing Munich Security Conference Chairman Wolfgang Ischinger speaks at the end of the Munich Security Conference (MSC) in Munich, southern Germany, on February 20, 2022.

362,Can US’ balancing strategy last after Ukraine crisis?,Ding Gang,2022-02-23,"On February 21, 1972, US President Richard Nixon came to Beijing to begin a ""world-changing"" visit. He became the first sitting US president to visit China.On February 28, China and the US issued the Shanghai Joint Communiqué, which laid the foundation for the subsequent development of US-China relations.Twenty years ago, in February 2002, I interviewed Dr Kissinger in New York. Over the past two days, I have gone over my notes from that interview and have been filled with emotion.The China-US relationship seems to have gone through a strange circle, from breaking the ice in 1972, to steadily rising to a warm point in 2002, and then beginning to freeze again.The world is also in the midst of dramatic change. From Chairman Mao Zedong's handshake with President Nixon, to former President Donald Trump's ""decoupling"" with, to China-Russia back-to-back partnership today, and the outbreak of the Ukraine crisis, great powers are beginning to reorganize.I clearly remember Dr Kissinger telling me at the time that the breakthrough in the Shanghai Communiqué was largely due to a mutual recognition that establishing direct contacts was possible and in the interest of both sides.Kissinger said President Nixon made the goal of establishing diplomatic relations with China an integral part of his international strategy as soon as he took office. The China side had the same consideration.According to Kissinger, there were also concerns on the China side at the time about the threat from the Soviet Union. Those were the two bases on which the Shanghai Communiqué made its breakthrough. The basic spirit of the communiqué, in his view, was to establish a direct cooperative relationship between the US and China.The two foundations Dr Kissinger spoke of reflect his idea of a balanced strategy. The central idea of his book World Order was that a balance of power based on the Peace of Westphalia was the key to avoiding war and building peace.This idea of strategic balance still influences US's global strategy today, and the adjustment of US policy toward China clearly comes from this idea.In recent years, some in US have insisted that the US-China relationship is headed for a breakdown because China has adopted a more aggressive strategy of foreign expansion, undermining the order that the US has worked on for years to establish in the Asia-Pacific region and is upsetting the global balance of power.Some US scholars also cited Kissinger's advice before Nixon's visit to China 50 years ago.According to declassified documents, Kissinger told Nixon at the time that the US should ""play the balance of power game without any emotion.""Kissinger also predicted that in 20 years, China would be ""even more powerful"" and reminded the US president at that time to consider how to rely on Russia to keep China down.Such a balance of power game is to create a US-led structure to balance the relationship between global powers. Essentially it is not about trying to cooperate with the other side, but to ensure that the US can suppress and dismantle the other side in order to achieve US hegemony. Such a balancing structure will eventually force many small and medium-sized countries to choose sides. The crisis in Ukraine, which has gone so far, is a typical example.However, after China's peaceful rise, such a balancing strategy has become increasingly difficult to achieve. China and the US have become increasingly interdependent over the course of the past 50 years, and it is clear that their relationship is no longer tempered by equilibrium. Any forces that US would like to leverage to reorganize the so-called balance will hardly stop China's continued development.Fifty years ago, the US-China relationship made a breakthrough because of the US balancing strategy, and now, 50 years later, the relationship is beginning to ""decouple."" This is because, in US's balanced strategy, it has never seen itself as a party that can be on an equal footing with its so-called rivals, but always calculating how to prevent other countries from challenging its hegemonic position.The author is a senior editor with People's Daily, and currently a senior fellow with the Chongyang Institute for Financial Studies at Renmin University of China. dinggang@globaltimes.com.cn.

363,"All sides should give Russia, Ukraine some space to resolve issue: Global Times editorial",Global Times,2022-02-23,"Russia President Vladimir Putin on Monday signed two decrees recognizing ""the Lugansk (LPR)"" and ""the Donetsk (DPR)"" as independent and sovereign states. Ukraine decided to recall its charge d'affairs in Russia and will reconsider its diplomatic relations with Russia. The sudden change in the Ukraine situation has aroused great concern around the world. In this regard, China State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi said on Tuesday that the legitimate security concerns of any country must be respected, and the purposes and principles of the UN Charter must be upheld. He said China once again called on all parties to exercise restraint, appreciate the importance of implementing the principle of indivisible security, and de-escalate the situation and resolve differences through dialogue and negotiations.It should be noted that it is very regrettable that the Ukraine issue has evolved so far. The US has continued its intensive containment on Russia, which finally forced Russia to try to realize its security demands in such a way. This is the outburst of the dissatisfaction of the party whose security demands have been ignored for a long time since the end of the Cold War. The situation in Ukraine is deteriorating. At this time, the international community cannot discard its efforts for peace and to avoid further escalating the situation.The prospect of the situation between Russia and Ukraine remains highly uncertain. The US and West countries immediately condemned Russia's move. The White House officials said further ""coordinated"" sanctions directed at Russia would be announced on Tuesday. UN Secretary-General António Guterres said Russia's decision is ""a violation of the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Ukraine and inconsistent with the principles of the Charter of the UN."" He called for addressing ""all issues peacefully."" Many countries said they should not give up diplomatic means to peacefully solve the problem and underlined that ""constructive diplomacy is the need of the hour.""The Russia-Ukraine crisis is a dual crisis, in which bilateral conflicts between Russia and Ukraine are intertwined with the strategic suppression that NATO's eastward expansion has brought to Russia. All relevant parties have put forward their own security demands before. Although no consensus was reached, that doesn't necessarily mean a complete breakup of negotiations. It hasn't reached the point that the issue must be solved by war. Whether the situation will further escalate next mainly depends on the scale of the US sanctions imposed on Russia and whether Russia will be provoked to take more aggressive measures.Peace and no war is in the biggest and common interests of all countries in the EU continent. In this sense, only by achieving a soft landing for the Russia-Ukraine crisis can EU realize peace. True security should be inalienable, common, integrated, cooperative and sustainable. This means all sides' security interests should be respected and safeguarded, and if any party's security concerns are ignored or even trampled on, geopolitical disputes will continue and never cease. The knot must be untied by the one who tied it. Russia and Ukraine need to have face-to-face dialogues. The US and NATO should be pulled back from the Russia-Ukraine crisis as much as possible and there should be no more complicated elements added to influence the situation.In particular, at a time when the situation is uncertain, all sides should leave some space for Russia and Ukraine to solve the problems. Confrontation, sanctions, or even a direct battle will not help ease tensions. The flames scattered in eastern Ukraine are reminding all parties of the fact that blindly imposing pressure will only lead to an escalation of conflicts. What is most needed there are restraints and rationality, as well as constructive efforts of the international community.   China has no self-interest in the Ukraine issue. It has always upheld a fair and responsible attitude and will decide its own position based on the merits of the matter itself. Although all parties have different views on the Ukraine crisis, the top priority now is to avoid any actions that could intensify tensions. The international community should reach such a consensus as soon as possible. The development of the Ukraine situation is the result of a series of complex factors. Now that it has come to the brink of a cliff, all parties should work together to pull it back.",OPINION,EDITORIAL,"United Nations Security Council meets after Russia recognized two breakaway regions in eastern Ukraine as independent entities, in New York City on Monday.

367,"EU agrees Russia sanctions package, warns of further action",Xinhua,2022-02-23," The EU (EU) is ready to take further action against Russia if it continues to escalate the crisis, EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen warned here on Tuesday.In a statement, von der Leyen said EU member states had given their political consent to a new package of sanctions against Russia following its recognition of the independence of the Ukraine regions of Donetsk and Luhansk.The package contains a number of ""calibrated measures"" targeting banks that finance the Russia military apparatus and contribute to the destabilization of Ukraine.It also bans trade between the two breakaway regions and the EU, as it did with Crimea in 2014, and limits the Russia government's ability to raise capital on the EU's financial markets.Russia President Vladimir Putin on Monday evening signed decrees recognizing the independence of two self-proclaimed regions in eastern Ukraine's Donbass as ""the Lugansk (LPR)"" and ""the Donetsk (DPR).""Russia has done everything to preserve the territorial integrity of Ukraine by fighting for the implementation of 2015 Minsk agreement, but all the efforts ended up in vain, Vladimir Putin said on Monday.The security crisis occurred due to NATO's eastward expansion, which has led to the loss of mutual trust with Russia, he noted.According to Josep Borrell, EU's High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, the package comprises sanctions against 351 members of the Russia State Duma (lower house of the country's Federal Assembly) who voted to recognize the two regions.The EU will also ""target 27 individuals and entities who are playing a role in undermining or threatening Ukraine's territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence,"" he said.Furthermore, the sanctions aim to target the Russia state's ability to access the EU's capital and financial markets and services.""If Russia continues to escalate this crisis that it has created, we are ready to take further action in response,"" von der Leyen said.On the controversial Russia-Germany Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, von der Leyen said she believed that the Germany government was ""absolutely right"" to stop the project, which must be assessed in light of the security of energy supply for all of EU.""This crisis shows that EU is still too dependent on Russia gas. We have to diversify our suppliers and massively invest in renewables. This is a strategic investment in our energy independence,"" she said.The conflict in eastern Ukraine began in April 2014 with fightings between the Ukraine government troops and local armed groups who seized several towns.With the mediation of the global community, the two sides in Belarus' capital of Minsk reached ceasefire agreements in September 2014 and February 2015 respectively.Russia has been seeking NATO's guarantee to halt eastward expansion. However, U.S. President Joe Biden's administration took a hard line against Russia, supporting Ukraine's efforts to join the U.S.-led military alliance and increasing its military assistance to Ukraine, which has re-escalated tensions in the region.The situation in eastern Ukraine has been getting worse since Feb. 17, as the Ukraine government and local armed groups blamed each other for launching aggressive bombards.",WORLD,EUROPE,"European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen makes a statement on the Ukraine issue in Brussels, Belgium, on Feb. 22, 2022.

Ukraine refused to recognize their self-proclaimed status.Calling Russia's move ""the beginning of a Russia invasion of Ukraine,"" Joe Biden said in remarks delivered from the White House that his administration will impose sanctions on two Russia financial institutions - the VEB and the country's military bank -- as well as on Russia's sovereign debt and three individuals.He explained that the measure ""means we've cut off Russia's government from West financing.

371,"US hardly leads the West out of helplessness, but is in fact the cause",Zhao Minghao,2022-02-23,"The Munich Security Conference 2022 was held under the shadow of multiple challenges including the Ukraine crisis. The Munich Security Index 2022 shows perceptions of risk that pervade the societies of G7 countries due to COVID-19 pandemic, geopolitical tensions, domestic political polarization, and rising inequality. As the Munich Security Report 2022 points out, many West people believe that they are living in a ""new era of successive and interconnected disruptions,"" and there is a growing ""collective helplessness.""Such helplessness comes from domestic political dysfunction. Economic inequality, ethnic tensions, and intergenerational conflicts are old problems that become even worse in a polarized political environment. The stagnation of political reforms has largely contributed to ""crisis fatigue"" within the G7 countries mentioned in the Munich Security Report 2022. People feel less confident in their governments. According to a recent NBC News poll, only 22 percent answered that things are ""headed in the right direction.""The trend toward the retreat of democracy continues, warned Wolfgang Ischinger, chairman of the Munich Security Conference. The ""illiberal movement"" within the West is worsening, and there are challenges like populism and neo-fascism. US leadership in the West has been damaged due to its domestic illiberal movement. During the Joe Biden presidency, the US is more divided under the crisis of democracy. Helplessness stems from the external challenges West countries face, which are often self-imposed. NATO enlargement and the EU's expansion eastward are the key factors influencing Russia's strong responses to the Ukraine crisis, according to John Mearsheimer, professor at the University of Chicago. He pointed out that the Ukraine crisis is the West's fault as the West had been moving into Russia's backyard and threatening its core strategic interests. Indeed, Ukraine has the right to make a choice, but that choice should not expose its neighbor to a major security threat. Given the US and EU interference in Ukraine, it's hard to argue that Kiev's choice is truly ""independent."" Leaked classified documents show that senior US officials like Victoria Nuland, US' current under secretary of state for political affairs, have been weighing in on the make-up of the Ukraine government. For the US, the survival of NATO depends on deliberately created geopolitical tensions. The Obama administration's actions during the Russo-Georgian War and the Joe Biden administration's moves during the recent Ukraine crisis show to the world a rattled US government. ""Helpless"" EU must realize that there is indeed a geopolitical factor. Some EU countries, including Germany, seem to be interested in participating in the geopolitical game in the Indo-Pacific region, following US to provoke Beijing on the Taiwan question. This will bring them into trouble. Another contribution to the West's helplessness is the Afghanistan issue. With the hasty withdrawal of the US troops from Afghanistan, the humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan is getting worse because of the de facto US sanctions against the Taliban. The West does have a sense of frustration over Afghanistan, but it cannot be allowed to shrug off its responsibility in an immoral matter. The West is facing what former EU Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker called a ""polycrisis."" The US is hardly leading the West out of helplessness, and is in fact the cause. As the Munich Security Report 2022 emphasizes, collectively, they have the chance to turn the tide. Individually they risk being swept away. EU needs to make efforts to this end, especially to persuade US not to indulge in confrontations with China and Russia. The author is a senior fellow at the Charhar Institute and China Forum Expert at Tsinghua University. opinion@globaltimes.com.cn",OPINION,VIEWPOINT,"Outgoing Munich Security Conference Chairman Wolfgang Ischinger speaks at the end of the Munich Security Conference (MSC) in Munich, southern Germany, on February 20, 2022.

372,Can US’ balancing strategy last after Ukraine crisis?,Ding Gang,2022-02-23,"On February 21, 1972, US President Richard Nixon came to Beijing to begin a ""world-changing"" visit. He became the first sitting US president to visit China.On February 28, China and the US issued the Shanghai Joint Communiqué, which laid the foundation for the subsequent development of US-China relations.Twenty years ago, in February 2002, I interviewed Dr Kissinger in New York. Over the past two days, I have gone over my notes from that interview and have been filled with emotion.The China-US relationship seems to have gone through a strange circle, from breaking the ice in 1972, to steadily rising to a warm point in 2002, and then beginning to freeze again.The world is also in the midst of dramatic change. From Chairman Mao Zedong's handshake with President Nixon, to former President Donald Trump's ""decoupling"" with, to China-Russia back-to-back partnership today, and the outbreak of the Ukraine crisis, great powers are beginning to reorganize.I clearly remember Dr Kissinger telling me at the time that the breakthrough in the Shanghai Communiqué was largely due to a mutual recognition that establishing direct contacts was possible and in the interest of both sides.Kissinger said President Nixon made the goal of establishing diplomatic relations with China an integral part of his international strategy as soon as he took office. The China side had the same consideration.According to Kissinger, there were also concerns on the China side at the time about the threat from the Soviet Union. Those were the two bases on which the Shanghai Communiqué made its breakthrough. The basic spirit of the communiqué, in his view, was to establish a direct cooperative relationship between the US and China.The two foundations Dr Kissinger spoke of reflect his idea of a balanced strategy. The central idea of his book World Order was that a balance of power based on the Peace of Westphalia was the key to avoiding war and building peace.This idea of strategic balance still influences US's global strategy today, and the adjustment of US policy toward China clearly comes from this idea.In recent years, some in US have insisted that the US-China relationship is headed for a breakdown because China has adopted a more aggressive strategy of foreign expansion, undermining the order that the US has worked on for years to establish in the Asia-Pacific region and is upsetting the global balance of power.Some US scholars also cited Kissinger's advice before Nixon's visit to China 50 years ago.According to declassified documents, Kissinger told Nixon at the time that the US should ""play the balance of power game without any emotion.""Kissinger also predicted that in 20 years, China would be ""even more powerful"" and reminded the US president at that time to consider how to rely on Russia to keep China down.Such a balance of power game is to create a US-led structure to balance the relationship between global powers. Essentially it is not about trying to cooperate with the other side, but to ensure that the US can suppress and dismantle the other side in order to achieve US hegemony. Such a balancing structure will eventually force many small and medium-sized countries to choose sides. The crisis in Ukraine, which has gone so far, is a typical example.However, after China's peaceful rise, such a balancing strategy has become increasingly difficult to achieve. China and the US have become increasingly interdependent over the course of the past 50 years, and it is clear that their relationship is no longer tempered by equilibrium. Any forces that US would like to leverage to reorganize the so-called balance will hardly stop China's continued development.Fifty years ago, the US-China relationship made a breakthrough because of the US balancing strategy, and now, 50 years later, the relationship is beginning to ""decouple."" This is because, in US's balanced strategy, it has never seen itself as a party that can be on an equal footing with its so-called rivals, but always calculating how to prevent other countries from challenging its hegemonic position.The author is a senior editor with People's Daily, and currently a senior fellow with the Chongyang Institute for Financial Studies at Renmin University of China. dinggang@globaltimes.com.cn.

373,"All sides should give Russia, Ukraine some space to resolve issue: Global Times editorial",Global Times,2022-02-23,"Russia President Vladimir Putin on Monday signed two decrees recognizing ""the Lugansk (LPR)"" and ""the Donetsk (DPR)"" as independent and sovereign states. Ukraine decided to recall its charge d'affairs in Russia and will reconsider its diplomatic relations with Russia. The sudden change in the Ukraine situation has aroused great concern around the world. In this regard, China State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi said on Tuesday that the legitimate security concerns of any country must be respected, and the purposes and principles of the UN Charter must be upheld. He said China once again called on all parties to exercise restraint, appreciate the importance of implementing the principle of indivisible security, and de-escalate the situation and resolve differences through dialogue and negotiations.It should be noted that it is very regrettable that the Ukraine issue has evolved so far. The US has continued its intensive containment on Russia, which finally forced Russia to try to realize its security demands in such a way. This is the outburst of the dissatisfaction of the party whose security demands have been ignored for a long time since the end of the Cold War. The situation in Ukraine is deteriorating. At this time, the international community cannot discard its efforts for peace and to avoid further escalating the situation.The prospect of the situation between Russia and Ukraine remains highly uncertain. The US and West countries immediately condemned Russia's move. The White House officials said further ""coordinated"" sanctions directed at Russia would be announced on Tuesday. UN Secretary-General António Guterres said Russia's decision is ""a violation of the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Ukraine and inconsistent with the principles of the Charter of the UN."" He called for addressing ""all issues peacefully."" Many countries said they should not give up diplomatic means to peacefully solve the problem and underlined that ""constructive diplomacy is the need of the hour.""The Russia-Ukraine crisis is a dual crisis, in which bilateral conflicts between Russia and Ukraine are intertwined with the strategic suppression that NATO's eastward expansion has brought to Russia. All relevant parties have put forward their own security demands before. Although no consensus was reached, that doesn't necessarily mean a complete breakup of negotiations. It hasn't reached the point that the issue must be solved by war. Whether the situation will further escalate next mainly depends on the scale of the US sanctions imposed on Russia and whether Russia will be provoked to take more aggressive measures.Peace and no war is in the biggest and common interests of all countries in the EU continent. In this sense, only by achieving a soft landing for the Russia-Ukraine crisis can EU realize peace. True security should be inalienable, common, integrated, cooperative and sustainable. This means all sides' security interests should be respected and safeguarded, and if any party's security concerns are ignored or even trampled on, geopolitical disputes will continue and never cease. The knot must be untied by the one who tied it. Russia and Ukraine need to have face-to-face dialogues. The US and NATO should be pulled back from the Russia-Ukraine crisis as much as possible and there should be no more complicated elements added to influence the situation.In particular, at a time when the situation is uncertain, all sides should leave some space for Russia and Ukraine to solve the problems. Confrontation, sanctions, or even a direct battle will not help ease tensions. The flames scattered in eastern Ukraine are reminding all parties of the fact that blindly imposing pressure will only lead to an escalation of conflicts. What is most needed there are restraints and rationality, as well as constructive efforts of the international community.   China has no self-interest in the Ukraine issue. It has always upheld a fair and responsible attitude and will decide its own position based on the merits of the matter itself. Although all parties have different views on the Ukraine crisis, the top priority now is to avoid any actions that could intensify tensions. The international community should reach such a consensus as soon as possible. The development of the Ukraine situation is the result of a series of complex factors. Now that it has come to the brink of a cliff, all parties should work together to pull it back.",OPINION,EDITORIAL,"United Nations Security Council meets after Russia recognized two breakaway regions in eastern Ukraine as independent entities, in New York City on Monday.

377,"EU agrees Russia sanctions package, warns of further action",Xinhua,2022-02-23," The EU (EU) is ready to take further action against Russia if it continues to escalate the crisis, EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen warned here on Tuesday.In a statement, von der Leyen said EU member states had given their political consent to a new package of sanctions against Russia following its recognition of the independence of the Ukraine regions of Donetsk and Luhansk.The package contains a number of ""calibrated measures"" targeting banks that finance the Russia military apparatus and contribute to the destabilization of Ukraine.It also bans trade between the two breakaway regions and the EU, as it did with Crimea in 2014, and limits the Russia government's ability to raise capital on the EU's financial markets.Russia President Vladimir Putin on Monday evening signed decrees recognizing the independence of two self-proclaimed regions in eastern Ukraine's Donbass as ""the Lugansk (LPR)"" and ""the Donetsk (DPR).""Russia has done everything to preserve the territorial integrity of Ukraine by fighting for the implementation of 2015 Minsk agreement, but all the efforts ended up in vain, Vladimir Putin said on Monday.The security crisis occurred due to NATO's eastward expansion, which has led to the loss of mutual trust with Russia, he noted.According to Josep Borrell, EU's High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, the package comprises sanctions against 351 members of the Russia State Duma (lower house of the country's Federal Assembly) who voted to recognize the two regions.The EU will also ""target 27 individuals and entities who are playing a role in undermining or threatening Ukraine's territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence,"" he said.Furthermore, the sanctions aim to target the Russia state's ability to access the EU's capital and financial markets and services.""If Russia continues to escalate this crisis that it has created, we are ready to take further action in response,"" von der Leyen said.On the controversial Russia-Germany Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, von der Leyen said she believed that the Germany government was ""absolutely right"" to stop the project, which must be assessed in light of the security of energy supply for all of EU.""This crisis shows that EU is still too dependent on Russia gas. We have to diversify our suppliers and massively invest in renewables. This is a strategic investment in our energy independence,"" she said.The conflict in eastern Ukraine began in April 2014 with fightings between the Ukraine government troops and local armed groups who seized several towns.With the mediation of the global community, the two sides in Belarus' capital of Minsk reached ceasefire agreements in September 2014 and February 2015 respectively.Russia has been seeking NATO's guarantee to halt eastward expansion. However, U.S. President Joe Biden's administration took a hard line against Russia, supporting Ukraine's efforts to join the U.S.-led military alliance and increasing its military assistance to Ukraine, which has re-escalated tensions in the region.The situation in eastern Ukraine has been getting worse since Feb. 17, as the Ukraine government and local armed groups blamed each other for launching aggressive bombards.",WORLD,EUROPE,"European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen makes a statement on the Ukraine issue in Brussels, Belgium, on Feb. 22, 2022.

Ukraine refused to recognize their self-proclaimed status.Calling Russia's move ""the beginning of a Russia invasion of Ukraine,"" Joe Biden said in remarks delivered from the White House that his administration will impose sanctions on two Russia financial institutions - the VEB and the country's military bank -- as well as on Russia's sovereign debt and three individuals.He explained that the measure ""means we've cut off Russia's government from West financing.

381,"US hardly leads the West out of helplessness, but is in fact the cause",Zhao Minghao,2022-02-23,"The Munich Security Conference 2022 was held under the shadow of multiple challenges including the Ukraine crisis. The Munich Security Index 2022 shows perceptions of risk that pervade the societies of G7 countries due to COVID-19 pandemic, geopolitical tensions, domestic political polarization, and rising inequality. As the Munich Security Report 2022 points out, many West people believe that they are living in a ""new era of successive and interconnected disruptions,"" and there is a growing ""collective helplessness.""Such helplessness comes from domestic political dysfunction. Economic inequality, ethnic tensions, and intergenerational conflicts are old problems that become even worse in a polarized political environment. The stagnation of political reforms has largely contributed to ""crisis fatigue"" within the G7 countries mentioned in the Munich Security Report 2022. People feel less confident in their governments. According to a recent NBC News poll, only 22 percent answered that things are ""headed in the right direction.""The trend toward the retreat of democracy continues, warned Wolfgang Ischinger, chairman of the Munich Security Conference. The ""illiberal movement"" within the West is worsening, and there are challenges like populism and neo-fascism. US leadership in the West has been damaged due to its domestic illiberal movement. During the Joe Biden presidency, the US is more divided under the crisis of democracy. Helplessness stems from the external challenges West countries face, which are often self-imposed. NATO enlargement and the EU's expansion eastward are the key factors influencing Russia's strong responses to the Ukraine crisis, according to John Mearsheimer, professor at the University of Chicago. He pointed out that the Ukraine crisis is the West's fault as the West had been moving into Russia's backyard and threatening its core strategic interests. Indeed, Ukraine has the right to make a choice, but that choice should not expose its neighbor to a major security threat. Given the US and EU interference in Ukraine, it's hard to argue that Kiev's choice is truly ""independent."" Leaked classified documents show that senior US officials like Victoria Nuland, US' current under secretary of state for political affairs, have been weighing in on the make-up of the Ukraine government. For the US, the survival of NATO depends on deliberately created geopolitical tensions. The Obama administration's actions during the Russo-Georgian War and the Joe Biden administration's moves during the recent Ukraine crisis show to the world a rattled US government. ""Helpless"" EU must realize that there is indeed a geopolitical factor. Some EU countries, including Germany, seem to be interested in participating in the geopolitical game in the Indo-Pacific region, following US to provoke Beijing on the Taiwan question. This will bring them into trouble. Another contribution to the West's helplessness is the Afghanistan issue. With the hasty withdrawal of the US troops from Afghanistan, the humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan is getting worse because of the de facto US sanctions against the Taliban. The West does have a sense of frustration over Afghanistan, but it cannot be allowed to shrug off its responsibility in an immoral matter. The West is facing what former EU Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker called a ""polycrisis."" The US is hardly leading the West out of helplessness, and is in fact the cause. As the Munich Security Report 2022 emphasizes, collectively, they have the chance to turn the tide. Individually they risk being swept away. EU needs to make efforts to this end, especially to persuade US not to indulge in confrontations with China and Russia. The author is a senior fellow at the Charhar Institute and China Forum Expert at Tsinghua University. opinion@globaltimes.com.cn",OPINION,VIEWPOINT,"Outgoing Munich Security Conference Chairman Wolfgang Ischinger speaks at the end of the Munich Security Conference (MSC) in Munich, southern Germany, on February 20, 2022.

382,Can US’ balancing strategy last after Ukraine crisis?,Ding Gang,2022-02-23,"On February 21, 1972, US President Richard Nixon came to Beijing to begin a ""world-changing"" visit. He became the first sitting US president to visit China.On February 28, China and the US issued the Shanghai Joint Communiqué, which laid the foundation for the subsequent development of US-China relations.Twenty years ago, in February 2002, I interviewed Dr Kissinger in New York. Over the past two days, I have gone over my notes from that interview and have been filled with emotion.The China-US relationship seems to have gone through a strange circle, from breaking the ice in 1972, to steadily rising to a warm point in 2002, and then beginning to freeze again.The world is also in the midst of dramatic change. From Chairman Mao Zedong's handshake with President Nixon, to former President Donald Trump's ""decoupling"" with, to China-Russia back-to-back partnership today, and the outbreak of the Ukraine crisis, great powers are beginning to reorganize.I clearly remember Dr Kissinger telling me at the time that the breakthrough in the Shanghai Communiqué was largely due to a mutual recognition that establishing direct contacts was possible and in the interest of both sides.Kissinger said President Nixon made the goal of establishing diplomatic relations with China an integral part of his international strategy as soon as he took office. The China side had the same consideration.According to Kissinger, there were also concerns on the China side at the time about the threat from the Soviet Union. Those were the two bases on which the Shanghai Communiqué made its breakthrough. The basic spirit of the communiqué, in his view, was to establish a direct cooperative relationship between the US and China.The two foundations Dr Kissinger spoke of reflect his idea of a balanced strategy. The central idea of his book World Order was that a balance of power based on the Peace of Westphalia was the key to avoiding war and building peace.This idea of strategic balance still influences US's global strategy today, and the adjustment of US policy toward China clearly comes from this idea.In recent years, some in US have insisted that the US-China relationship is headed for a breakdown because China has adopted a more aggressive strategy of foreign expansion, undermining the order that the US has worked on for years to establish in the Asia-Pacific region and is upsetting the global balance of power.Some US scholars also cited Kissinger's advice before Nixon's visit to China 50 years ago.According to declassified documents, Kissinger told Nixon at the time that the US should ""play the balance of power game without any emotion.""Kissinger also predicted that in 20 years, China would be ""even more powerful"" and reminded the US president at that time to consider how to rely on Russia to keep China down.Such a balance of power game is to create a US-led structure to balance the relationship between global powers. Essentially it is not about trying to cooperate with the other side, but to ensure that the US can suppress and dismantle the other side in order to achieve US hegemony. Such a balancing structure will eventually force many small and medium-sized countries to choose sides. The crisis in Ukraine, which has gone so far, is a typical example.However, after China's peaceful rise, such a balancing strategy has become increasingly difficult to achieve. China and the US have become increasingly interdependent over the course of the past 50 years, and it is clear that their relationship is no longer tempered by equilibrium. Any forces that US would like to leverage to reorganize the so-called balance will hardly stop China's continued development.Fifty years ago, the US-China relationship made a breakthrough because of the US balancing strategy, and now, 50 years later, the relationship is beginning to ""decouple."" This is because, in US's balanced strategy, it has never seen itself as a party that can be on an equal footing with its so-called rivals, but always calculating how to prevent other countries from challenging its hegemonic position.The author is a senior editor with People's Daily, and currently a senior fellow with the Chongyang Institute for Financial Studies at Renmin University of China. dinggang@globaltimes.com.cn.

383,"All sides should give Russia, Ukraine some space to resolve issue: Global Times editorial",Global Times,2022-02-23,"Russia President Vladimir Putin on Monday signed two decrees recognizing ""the Lugansk (LPR)"" and ""the Donetsk (DPR)"" as independent and sovereign states. Ukraine decided to recall its charge d'affairs in Russia and will reconsider its diplomatic relations with Russia. The sudden change in the Ukraine situation has aroused great concern around the world. In this regard, China State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi said on Tuesday that the legitimate security concerns of any country must be respected, and the purposes and principles of the UN Charter must be upheld. He said China once again called on all parties to exercise restraint, appreciate the importance of implementing the principle of indivisible security, and de-escalate the situation and resolve differences through dialogue and negotiations.It should be noted that it is very regrettable that the Ukraine issue has evolved so far. The US has continued its intensive containment on Russia, which finally forced Russia to try to realize its security demands in such a way. This is the outburst of the dissatisfaction of the party whose security demands have been ignored for a long time since the end of the Cold War. The situation in Ukraine is deteriorating. At this time, the international community cannot discard its efforts for peace and to avoid further escalating the situation.The prospect of the situation between Russia and Ukraine remains highly uncertain. The US and West countries immediately condemned Russia's move. The White House officials said further ""coordinated"" sanctions directed at Russia would be announced on Tuesday. UN Secretary-General António Guterres said Russia's decision is ""a violation of the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Ukraine and inconsistent with the principles of the Charter of the UN."" He called for addressing ""all issues peacefully."" Many countries said they should not give up diplomatic means to peacefully solve the problem and underlined that ""constructive diplomacy is the need of the hour.""The Russia-Ukraine crisis is a dual crisis, in which bilateral conflicts between Russia and Ukraine are intertwined with the strategic suppression that NATO's eastward expansion has brought to Russia. All relevant parties have put forward their own security demands before. Although no consensus was reached, that doesn't necessarily mean a complete breakup of negotiations. It hasn't reached the point that the issue must be solved by war. Whether the situation will further escalate next mainly depends on the scale of the US sanctions imposed on Russia and whether Russia will be provoked to take more aggressive measures.Peace and no war is in the biggest and common interests of all countries in the EU continent. In this sense, only by achieving a soft landing for the Russia-Ukraine crisis can EU realize peace. True security should be inalienable, common, integrated, cooperative and sustainable. This means all sides' security interests should be respected and safeguarded, and if any party's security concerns are ignored or even trampled on, geopolitical disputes will continue and never cease. The knot must be untied by the one who tied it. Russia and Ukraine need to have face-to-face dialogues. The US and NATO should be pulled back from the Russia-Ukraine crisis as much as possible and there should be no more complicated elements added to influence the situation.In particular, at a time when the situation is uncertain, all sides should leave some space for Russia and Ukraine to solve the problems. Confrontation, sanctions, or even a direct battle will not help ease tensions. The flames scattered in eastern Ukraine are reminding all parties of the fact that blindly imposing pressure will only lead to an escalation of conflicts. What is most needed there are restraints and rationality, as well as constructive efforts of the international community.   China has no self-interest in the Ukraine issue. It has always upheld a fair and responsible attitude and will decide its own position based on the merits of the matter itself. Although all parties have different views on the Ukraine crisis, the top priority now is to avoid any actions that could intensify tensions. The international community should reach such a consensus as soon as possible. The development of the Ukraine situation is the result of a series of complex factors. Now that it has come to the brink of a cliff, all parties should work together to pull it back.",OPINION,EDITORIAL,"United Nations Security Council meets after Russia recognized two breakaway regions in eastern Ukraine as independent entities, in New York City on Monday.

387,"EU agrees Russia sanctions package, warns of further action",Xinhua,2022-02-23," The EU (EU) is ready to take further action against Russia if it continues to escalate the crisis, EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen warned here on Tuesday.In a statement, von der Leyen said EU member states had given their political consent to a new package of sanctions against Russia following its recognition of the independence of the Ukraine regions of Donetsk and Luhansk.The package contains a number of ""calibrated measures"" targeting banks that finance the Russia military apparatus and contribute to the destabilization of Ukraine.It also bans trade between the two breakaway regions and the EU, as it did with Crimea in 2014, and limits the Russia government's ability to raise capital on the EU's financial markets.Russia President Vladimir Putin on Monday evening signed decrees recognizing the independence of two self-proclaimed regions in eastern Ukraine's Donbass as ""the Lugansk (LPR)"" and ""the Donetsk (DPR).""Russia has done everything to preserve the territorial integrity of Ukraine by fighting for the implementation of 2015 Minsk agreement, but all the efforts ended up in vain, Vladimir Putin said on Monday.The security crisis occurred due to NATO's eastward expansion, which has led to the loss of mutual trust with Russia, he noted.According to Josep Borrell, EU's High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, the package comprises sanctions against 351 members of the Russia State Duma (lower house of the country's Federal Assembly) who voted to recognize the two regions.The EU will also ""target 27 individuals and entities who are playing a role in undermining or threatening Ukraine's territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence,"" he said.Furthermore, the sanctions aim to target the Russia state's ability to access the EU's capital and financial markets and services.""If Russia continues to escalate this crisis that it has created, we are ready to take further action in response,"" von der Leyen said.On the controversial Russia-Germany Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, von der Leyen said she believed that the Germany government was ""absolutely right"" to stop the project, which must be assessed in light of the security of energy supply for all of EU.""This crisis shows that EU is still too dependent on Russia gas. We have to diversify our suppliers and massively invest in renewables. This is a strategic investment in our energy independence,"" she said.The conflict in eastern Ukraine began in April 2014 with fightings between the Ukraine government troops and local armed groups who seized several towns.With the mediation of the global community, the two sides in Belarus' capital of Minsk reached ceasefire agreements in September 2014 and February 2015 respectively.Russia has been seeking NATO's guarantee to halt eastward expansion. However, U.S. President Joe Biden's administration took a hard line against Russia, supporting Ukraine's efforts to join the U.S.-led military alliance and increasing its military assistance to Ukraine, which has re-escalated tensions in the region.The situation in eastern Ukraine has been getting worse since Feb. 17, as the Ukraine government and local armed groups blamed each other for launching aggressive bombards.",WORLD,EUROPE,"European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen makes a statement on the Ukraine issue in Brussels, Belgium, on Feb. 22, 2022.

Ukraine refused to recognize their self-proclaimed status.Calling Russia's move ""the beginning of a Russia invasion of Ukraine,"" Joe Biden said in remarks delivered from the White House that his administration will impose sanctions on two Russia financial institutions - the VEB and the country's military bank -- as well as on Russia's sovereign debt and three individuals.He explained that the measure ""means we've cut off Russia's government from West financing.

391,"US hardly leads the West out of helplessness, but is in fact the cause",Zhao Minghao,2022-02-23,"The Munich Security Conference 2022 was held under the shadow of multiple challenges including the Ukraine crisis. The Munich Security Index 2022 shows perceptions of risk that pervade the societies of G7 countries due to COVID-19 pandemic, geopolitical tensions, domestic political polarization, and rising inequality. As the Munich Security Report 2022 points out, many West people believe that they are living in a ""new era of successive and interconnected disruptions,"" and there is a growing ""collective helplessness.""Such helplessness comes from domestic political dysfunction. Economic inequality, ethnic tensions, and intergenerational conflicts are old problems that become even worse in a polarized political environment. The stagnation of political reforms has largely contributed to ""crisis fatigue"" within the G7 countries mentioned in the Munich Security Report 2022. People feel less confident in their governments. According to a recent NBC News poll, only 22 percent answered that things are ""headed in the right direction.""The trend toward the retreat of democracy continues, warned Wolfgang Ischinger, chairman of the Munich Security Conference. The ""illiberal movement"" within the West is worsening, and there are challenges like populism and neo-fascism. US leadership in the West has been damaged due to its domestic illiberal movement. During the Joe Biden presidency, the US is more divided under the crisis of democracy. Helplessness stems from the external challenges West countries face, which are often self-imposed. NATO enlargement and the EU's expansion eastward are the key factors influencing Russia's strong responses to the Ukraine crisis, according to John Mearsheimer, professor at the University of Chicago. He pointed out that the Ukraine crisis is the West's fault as the West had been moving into Russia's backyard and threatening its core strategic interests. Indeed, Ukraine has the right to make a choice, but that choice should not expose its neighbor to a major security threat. Given the US and EU interference in Ukraine, it's hard to argue that Kiev's choice is truly ""independent."" Leaked classified documents show that senior US officials like Victoria Nuland, US' current under secretary of state for political affairs, have been weighing in on the make-up of the Ukraine government. For the US, the survival of NATO depends on deliberately created geopolitical tensions. The Obama administration's actions during the Russo-Georgian War and the Joe Biden administration's moves during the recent Ukraine crisis show to the world a rattled US government. ""Helpless"" EU must realize that there is indeed a geopolitical factor. Some EU countries, including Germany, seem to be interested in participating in the geopolitical game in the Indo-Pacific region, following US to provoke Beijing on the Taiwan question. This will bring them into trouble. Another contribution to the West's helplessness is the Afghanistan issue. With the hasty withdrawal of the US troops from Afghanistan, the humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan is getting worse because of the de facto US sanctions against the Taliban. The West does have a sense of frustration over Afghanistan, but it cannot be allowed to shrug off its responsibility in an immoral matter. The West is facing what former EU Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker called a ""polycrisis."" The US is hardly leading the West out of helplessness, and is in fact the cause. As the Munich Security Report 2022 emphasizes, collectively, they have the chance to turn the tide. Individually they risk being swept away. EU needs to make efforts to this end, especially to persuade US not to indulge in confrontations with China and Russia. The author is a senior fellow at the Charhar Institute and China Forum Expert at Tsinghua University. opinion@globaltimes.com.cn",OPINION,VIEWPOINT,"Outgoing Munich Security Conference Chairman Wolfgang Ischinger speaks at the end of the Munich Security Conference (MSC) in Munich, southern Germany, on February 20, 2022.

392,Can US’ balancing strategy last after Ukraine crisis?,Ding Gang,2022-02-23,"On February 21, 1972, US President Richard Nixon came to Beijing to begin a ""world-changing"" visit. He became the first sitting US president to visit China.On February 28, China and the US issued the Shanghai Joint Communiqué, which laid the foundation for the subsequent development of US-China relations.Twenty years ago, in February 2002, I interviewed Dr Kissinger in New York. Over the past two days, I have gone over my notes from that interview and have been filled with emotion.The China-US relationship seems to have gone through a strange circle, from breaking the ice in 1972, to steadily rising to a warm point in 2002, and then beginning to freeze again.The world is also in the midst of dramatic change. From Chairman Mao Zedong's handshake with President Nixon, to former President Donald Trump's ""decoupling"" with, to China-Russia back-to-back partnership today, and the outbreak of the Ukraine crisis, great powers are beginning to reorganize.I clearly remember Dr Kissinger telling me at the time that the breakthrough in the Shanghai Communiqué was largely due to a mutual recognition that establishing direct contacts was possible and in the interest of both sides.Kissinger said President Nixon made the goal of establishing diplomatic relations with China an integral part of his international strategy as soon as he took office. The China side had the same consideration.According to Kissinger, there were also concerns on the China side at the time about the threat from the Soviet Union. Those were the two bases on which the Shanghai Communiqué made its breakthrough. The basic spirit of the communiqué, in his view, was to establish a direct cooperative relationship between the US and China.The two foundations Dr Kissinger spoke of reflect his idea of a balanced strategy. The central idea of his book World Order was that a balance of power based on the Peace of Westphalia was the key to avoiding war and building peace.This idea of strategic balance still influences US's global strategy today, and the adjustment of US policy toward China clearly comes from this idea.In recent years, some in US have insisted that the US-China relationship is headed for a breakdown because China has adopted a more aggressive strategy of foreign expansion, undermining the order that the US has worked on for years to establish in the Asia-Pacific region and is upsetting the global balance of power.Some US scholars also cited Kissinger's advice before Nixon's visit to China 50 years ago.According to declassified documents, Kissinger told Nixon at the time that the US should ""play the balance of power game without any emotion.""Kissinger also predicted that in 20 years, China would be ""even more powerful"" and reminded the US president at that time to consider how to rely on Russia to keep China down.Such a balance of power game is to create a US-led structure to balance the relationship between global powers. Essentially it is not about trying to cooperate with the other side, but to ensure that the US can suppress and dismantle the other side in order to achieve US hegemony. Such a balancing structure will eventually force many small and medium-sized countries to choose sides. The crisis in Ukraine, which has gone so far, is a typical example.However, after China's peaceful rise, such a balancing strategy has become increasingly difficult to achieve. China and the US have become increasingly interdependent over the course of the past 50 years, and it is clear that their relationship is no longer tempered by equilibrium. Any forces that US would like to leverage to reorganize the so-called balance will hardly stop China's continued development.Fifty years ago, the US-China relationship made a breakthrough because of the US balancing strategy, and now, 50 years later, the relationship is beginning to ""decouple."" This is because, in US's balanced strategy, it has never seen itself as a party that can be on an equal footing with its so-called rivals, but always calculating how to prevent other countries from challenging its hegemonic position.The author is a senior editor with People's Daily, and currently a senior fellow with the Chongyang Institute for Financial Studies at Renmin University of China. dinggang@globaltimes.com.cn.

393,"All sides should give Russia, Ukraine some space to resolve issue: Global Times editorial",Global Times,2022-02-23,"Russia President Vladimir Putin on Monday signed two decrees recognizing ""the Lugansk (LPR)"" and ""the Donetsk (DPR)"" as independent and sovereign states. Ukraine decided to recall its charge d'affairs in Russia and will reconsider its diplomatic relations with Russia. The sudden change in the Ukraine situation has aroused great concern around the world. In this regard, China State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi said on Tuesday that the legitimate security concerns of any country must be respected, and the purposes and principles of the UN Charter must be upheld. He said China once again called on all parties to exercise restraint, appreciate the importance of implementing the principle of indivisible security, and de-escalate the situation and resolve differences through dialogue and negotiations.It should be noted that it is very regrettable that the Ukraine issue has evolved so far. The US has continued its intensive containment on Russia, which finally forced Russia to try to realize its security demands in such a way. This is the outburst of the dissatisfaction of the party whose security demands have been ignored for a long time since the end of the Cold War. The situation in Ukraine is deteriorating. At this time, the international community cannot discard its efforts for peace and to avoid further escalating the situation.The prospect of the situation between Russia and Ukraine remains highly uncertain. The US and West countries immediately condemned Russia's move. The White House officials said further ""coordinated"" sanctions directed at Russia would be announced on Tuesday. UN Secretary-General António Guterres said Russia's decision is ""a violation of the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Ukraine and inconsistent with the principles of the Charter of the UN."" He called for addressing ""all issues peacefully."" Many countries said they should not give up diplomatic means to peacefully solve the problem and underlined that ""constructive diplomacy is the need of the hour.""The Russia-Ukraine crisis is a dual crisis, in which bilateral conflicts between Russia and Ukraine are intertwined with the strategic suppression that NATO's eastward expansion has brought to Russia. All relevant parties have put forward their own security demands before. Although no consensus was reached, that doesn't necessarily mean a complete breakup of negotiations. It hasn't reached the point that the issue must be solved by war. Whether the situation will further escalate next mainly depends on the scale of the US sanctions imposed on Russia and whether Russia will be provoked to take more aggressive measures.Peace and no war is in the biggest and common interests of all countries in the EU continent. In this sense, only by achieving a soft landing for the Russia-Ukraine crisis can EU realize peace. True security should be inalienable, common, integrated, cooperative and sustainable. This means all sides' security interests should be respected and safeguarded, and if any party's security concerns are ignored or even trampled on, geopolitical disputes will continue and never cease. The knot must be untied by the one who tied it. Russia and Ukraine need to have face-to-face dialogues. The US and NATO should be pulled back from the Russia-Ukraine crisis as much as possible and there should be no more complicated elements added to influence the situation.In particular, at a time when the situation is uncertain, all sides should leave some space for Russia and Ukraine to solve the problems. Confrontation, sanctions, or even a direct battle will not help ease tensions. The flames scattered in eastern Ukraine are reminding all parties of the fact that blindly imposing pressure will only lead to an escalation of conflicts. What is most needed there are restraints and rationality, as well as constructive efforts of the international community.   China has no self-interest in the Ukraine issue. It has always upheld a fair and responsible attitude and will decide its own position based on the merits of the matter itself. Although all parties have different views on the Ukraine crisis, the top priority now is to avoid any actions that could intensify tensions. The international community should reach such a consensus as soon as possible. The development of the Ukraine situation is the result of a series of complex factors. Now that it has come to the brink of a cliff, all parties should work together to pull it back.",OPINION,EDITORIAL,"United Nations Security Council meets after Russia recognized two breakaway regions in eastern Ukraine as independent entities, in New York City on Monday.

397,"EU agrees Russia sanctions package, warns of further action",Xinhua,2022-02-23," The EU (EU) is ready to take further action against Russia if it continues to escalate the crisis, EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen warned here on Tuesday.In a statement, von der Leyen said EU member states had given their political consent to a new package of sanctions against Russia following its recognition of the independence of the Ukraine regions of Donetsk and Luhansk.The package contains a number of ""calibrated measures"" targeting banks that finance the Russia military apparatus and contribute to the destabilization of Ukraine.It also bans trade between the two breakaway regions and the EU, as it did with Crimea in 2014, and limits the Russia government's ability to raise capital on the EU's financial markets.Russia President Vladimir Putin on Monday evening signed decrees recognizing the independence of two self-proclaimed regions in eastern Ukraine's Donbass as ""the Lugansk (LPR)"" and ""the Donetsk (DPR).""Russia has done everything to preserve the territorial integrity of Ukraine by fighting for the implementation of 2015 Minsk agreement, but all the efforts ended up in vain, Vladimir Putin said on Monday.The security crisis occurred due to NATO's eastward expansion, which has led to the loss of mutual trust with Russia, he noted.According to Josep Borrell, EU's High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, the package comprises sanctions against 351 members of the Russia State Duma (lower house of the country's Federal Assembly) who voted to recognize the two regions.The EU will also ""target 27 individuals and entities who are playing a role in undermining or threatening Ukraine's territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence,"" he said.Furthermore, the sanctions aim to target the Russia state's ability to access the EU's capital and financial markets and services.""If Russia continues to escalate this crisis that it has created, we are ready to take further action in response,"" von der Leyen said.On the controversial Russia-Germany Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, von der Leyen said she believed that the Germany government was ""absolutely right"" to stop the project, which must be assessed in light of the security of energy supply for all of EU.""This crisis shows that EU is still too dependent on Russia gas. We have to diversify our suppliers and massively invest in renewables. This is a strategic investment in our energy independence,"" she said.The conflict in eastern Ukraine began in April 2014 with fightings between the Ukraine government troops and local armed groups who seized several towns.With the mediation of the global community, the two sides in Belarus' capital of Minsk reached ceasefire agreements in September 2014 and February 2015 respectively.Russia has been seeking NATO's guarantee to halt eastward expansion. However, U.S. President Joe Biden's administration took a hard line against Russia, supporting Ukraine's efforts to join the U.S.-led military alliance and increasing its military assistance to Ukraine, which has re-escalated tensions in the region.The situation in eastern Ukraine has been getting worse since Feb. 17, as the Ukraine government and local armed groups blamed each other for launching aggressive bombards.",WORLD,EUROPE,"European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen makes a statement on the Ukraine issue in Brussels, Belgium, on Feb. 22, 2022.

Ukraine refused to recognize their self-proclaimed status.Calling Russia's move ""the beginning of a Russia invasion of Ukraine,"" Joe Biden said in remarks delivered from the White House that his administration will impose sanctions on two Russia financial institutions - the VEB and the country's military bank -- as well as on Russia's sovereign debt and three individuals.He explained that the measure ""means we've cut off Russia's government from West financing.

401,"US hardly leads the West out of helplessness, but is in fact the cause",Zhao Minghao,2022-02-23,"The Munich Security Conference 2022 was held under the shadow of multiple challenges including the Ukraine crisis. The Munich Security Index 2022 shows perceptions of risk that pervade the societies of G7 countries due to COVID-19 pandemic, geopolitical tensions, domestic political polarization, and rising inequality. As the Munich Security Report 2022 points out, many West people believe that they are living in a ""new era of successive and interconnected disruptions,"" and there is a growing ""collective helplessness.""Such helplessness comes from domestic political dysfunction. Economic inequality, ethnic tensions, and intergenerational conflicts are old problems that become even worse in a polarized political environment. The stagnation of political reforms has largely contributed to ""crisis fatigue"" within the G7 countries mentioned in the Munich Security Report 2022. People feel less confident in their governments. According to a recent NBC News poll, only 22 percent answered that things are ""headed in the right direction.""The trend toward the retreat of democracy continues, warned Wolfgang Ischinger, chairman of the Munich Security Conference. The ""illiberal movement"" within the West is worsening, and there are challenges like populism and neo-fascism. US leadership in the West has been damaged due to its domestic illiberal movement. During the Joe Biden presidency, the US is more divided under the crisis of democracy. Helplessness stems from the external challenges West countries face, which are often self-imposed. NATO enlargement and the EU's expansion eastward are the key factors influencing Russia's strong responses to the Ukraine crisis, according to John Mearsheimer, professor at the University of Chicago. He pointed out that the Ukraine crisis is the West's fault as the West had been moving into Russia's backyard and threatening its core strategic interests. Indeed, Ukraine has the right to make a choice, but that choice should not expose its neighbor to a major security threat. Given the US and EU interference in Ukraine, it's hard to argue that Kiev's choice is truly ""independent."" Leaked classified documents show that senior US officials like Victoria Nuland, US' current under secretary of state for political affairs, have been weighing in on the make-up of the Ukraine government. For the US, the survival of NATO depends on deliberately created geopolitical tensions. The Obama administration's actions during the Russo-Georgian War and the Joe Biden administration's moves during the recent Ukraine crisis show to the world a rattled US government. ""Helpless"" EU must realize that there is indeed a geopolitical factor. Some EU countries, including Germany, seem to be interested in participating in the geopolitical game in the Indo-Pacific region, following US to provoke Beijing on the Taiwan question. This will bring them into trouble. Another contribution to the West's helplessness is the Afghanistan issue. With the hasty withdrawal of the US troops from Afghanistan, the humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan is getting worse because of the de facto US sanctions against the Taliban. The West does have a sense of frustration over Afghanistan, but it cannot be allowed to shrug off its responsibility in an immoral matter. The West is facing what former EU Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker called a ""polycrisis."" The US is hardly leading the West out of helplessness, and is in fact the cause. As the Munich Security Report 2022 emphasizes, collectively, they have the chance to turn the tide. Individually they risk being swept away. EU needs to make efforts to this end, especially to persuade US not to indulge in confrontations with China and Russia. The author is a senior fellow at the Charhar Institute and China Forum Expert at Tsinghua University. opinion@globaltimes.com.cn",OPINION,VIEWPOINT,"Outgoing Munich Security Conference Chairman Wolfgang Ischinger speaks at the end of the Munich Security Conference (MSC) in Munich, southern Germany, on February 20, 2022.

402,Can US’ balancing strategy last after Ukraine crisis?,Ding Gang,2022-02-23,"On February 21, 1972, US President Richard Nixon came to Beijing to begin a ""world-changing"" visit. He became the first sitting US president to visit China.On February 28, China and the US issued the Shanghai Joint Communiqué, which laid the foundation for the subsequent development of US-China relations.Twenty years ago, in February 2002, I interviewed Dr Kissinger in New York. Over the past two days, I have gone over my notes from that interview and have been filled with emotion.The China-US relationship seems to have gone through a strange circle, from breaking the ice in 1972, to steadily rising to a warm point in 2002, and then beginning to freeze again.The world is also in the midst of dramatic change. From Chairman Mao Zedong's handshake with President Nixon, to former President Donald Trump's ""decoupling"" with, to China-Russia back-to-back partnership today, and the outbreak of the Ukraine crisis, great powers are beginning to reorganize.I clearly remember Dr Kissinger telling me at the time that the breakthrough in the Shanghai Communiqué was largely due to a mutual recognition that establishing direct contacts was possible and in the interest of both sides.Kissinger said President Nixon made the goal of establishing diplomatic relations with China an integral part of his international strategy as soon as he took office. The China side had the same consideration.According to Kissinger, there were also concerns on the China side at the time about the threat from the Soviet Union. Those were the two bases on which the Shanghai Communiqué made its breakthrough. The basic spirit of the communiqué, in his view, was to establish a direct cooperative relationship between the US and China.The two foundations Dr Kissinger spoke of reflect his idea of a balanced strategy. The central idea of his book World Order was that a balance of power based on the Peace of Westphalia was the key to avoiding war and building peace.This idea of strategic balance still influences US's global strategy today, and the adjustment of US policy toward China clearly comes from this idea.In recent years, some in US have insisted that the US-China relationship is headed for a breakdown because China has adopted a more aggressive strategy of foreign expansion, undermining the order that the US has worked on for years to establish in the Asia-Pacific region and is upsetting the global balance of power.Some US scholars also cited Kissinger's advice before Nixon's visit to China 50 years ago.According to declassified documents, Kissinger told Nixon at the time that the US should ""play the balance of power game without any emotion.""Kissinger also predicted that in 20 years, China would be ""even more powerful"" and reminded the US president at that time to consider how to rely on Russia to keep China down.Such a balance of power game is to create a US-led structure to balance the relationship between global powers. Essentially it is not about trying to cooperate with the other side, but to ensure that the US can suppress and dismantle the other side in order to achieve US hegemony. Such a balancing structure will eventually force many small and medium-sized countries to choose sides. The crisis in Ukraine, which has gone so far, is a typical example.However, after China's peaceful rise, such a balancing strategy has become increasingly difficult to achieve. China and the US have become increasingly interdependent over the course of the past 50 years, and it is clear that their relationship is no longer tempered by equilibrium. Any forces that US would like to leverage to reorganize the so-called balance will hardly stop China's continued development.Fifty years ago, the US-China relationship made a breakthrough because of the US balancing strategy, and now, 50 years later, the relationship is beginning to ""decouple."" This is because, in US's balanced strategy, it has never seen itself as a party that can be on an equal footing with its so-called rivals, but always calculating how to prevent other countries from challenging its hegemonic position.The author is a senior editor with People's Daily, and currently a senior fellow with the Chongyang Institute for Financial Studies at Renmin University of China. dinggang@globaltimes.com.cn.

403,"All sides should give Russia, Ukraine some space to resolve issue: Global Times editorial",Global Times,2022-02-23,"Russia President Vladimir Putin on Monday signed two decrees recognizing ""the Lugansk (LPR)"" and ""the Donetsk (DPR)"" as independent and sovereign states. Ukraine decided to recall its charge d'affairs in Russia and will reconsider its diplomatic relations with Russia. The sudden change in the Ukraine situation has aroused great concern around the world. In this regard, China State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi said on Tuesday that the legitimate security concerns of any country must be respected, and the purposes and principles of the UN Charter must be upheld. He said China once again called on all parties to exercise restraint, appreciate the importance of implementing the principle of indivisible security, and de-escalate the situation and resolve differences through dialogue and negotiations.It should be noted that it is very regrettable that the Ukraine issue has evolved so far. The US has continued its intensive containment on Russia, which finally forced Russia to try to realize its security demands in such a way. This is the outburst of the dissatisfaction of the party whose security demands have been ignored for a long time since the end of the Cold War. The situation in Ukraine is deteriorating. At this time, the international community cannot discard its efforts for peace and to avoid further escalating the situation.The prospect of the situation between Russia and Ukraine remains highly uncertain. The US and West countries immediately condemned Russia's move. The White House officials said further ""coordinated"" sanctions directed at Russia would be announced on Tuesday. UN Secretary-General António Guterres said Russia's decision is ""a violation of the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Ukraine and inconsistent with the principles of the Charter of the UN."" He called for addressing ""all issues peacefully."" Many countries said they should not give up diplomatic means to peacefully solve the problem and underlined that ""constructive diplomacy is the need of the hour.""The Russia-Ukraine crisis is a dual crisis, in which bilateral conflicts between Russia and Ukraine are intertwined with the strategic suppression that NATO's eastward expansion has brought to Russia. All relevant parties have put forward their own security demands before. Although no consensus was reached, that doesn't necessarily mean a complete breakup of negotiations. It hasn't reached the point that the issue must be solved by war. Whether the situation will further escalate next mainly depends on the scale of the US sanctions imposed on Russia and whether Russia will be provoked to take more aggressive measures.Peace and no war is in the biggest and common interests of all countries in the EU continent. In this sense, only by achieving a soft landing for the Russia-Ukraine crisis can EU realize peace. True security should be inalienable, common, integrated, cooperative and sustainable. This means all sides' security interests should be respected and safeguarded, and if any party's security concerns are ignored or even trampled on, geopolitical disputes will continue and never cease. The knot must be untied by the one who tied it. Russia and Ukraine need to have face-to-face dialogues. The US and NATO should be pulled back from the Russia-Ukraine crisis as much as possible and there should be no more complicated elements added to influence the situation.In particular, at a time when the situation is uncertain, all sides should leave some space for Russia and Ukraine to solve the problems. Confrontation, sanctions, or even a direct battle will not help ease tensions. The flames scattered in eastern Ukraine are reminding all parties of the fact that blindly imposing pressure will only lead to an escalation of conflicts. What is most needed there are restraints and rationality, as well as constructive efforts of the international community.   China has no self-interest in the Ukraine issue. It has always upheld a fair and responsible attitude and will decide its own position based on the merits of the matter itself. Although all parties have different views on the Ukraine crisis, the top priority now is to avoid any actions that could intensify tensions. The international community should reach such a consensus as soon as possible. The development of the Ukraine situation is the result of a series of complex factors. Now that it has come to the brink of a cliff, all parties should work together to pull it back.",OPINION,EDITORIAL,"United Nations Security Council meets after Russia recognized two breakaway regions in eastern Ukraine as independent entities, in New York City on Monday.

407,"EU agrees Russia sanctions package, warns of further action",Xinhua,2022-02-23," The EU (EU) is ready to take further action against Russia if it continues to escalate the crisis, EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen warned here on Tuesday.In a statement, von der Leyen said EU member states had given their political consent to a new package of sanctions against Russia following its recognition of the independence of the Ukraine regions of Donetsk and Luhansk.The package contains a number of ""calibrated measures"" targeting banks that finance the Russia military apparatus and contribute to the destabilization of Ukraine.It also bans trade between the two breakaway regions and the EU, as it did with Crimea in 2014, and limits the Russia government's ability to raise capital on the EU's financial markets.Russia President Vladimir Putin on Monday evening signed decrees recognizing the independence of two self-proclaimed regions in eastern Ukraine's Donbass as ""the Lugansk (LPR)"" and ""the Donetsk (DPR).""Russia has done everything to preserve the territorial integrity of Ukraine by fighting for the implementation of 2015 Minsk agreement, but all the efforts ended up in vain, Vladimir Putin said on Monday.The security crisis occurred due to NATO's eastward expansion, which has led to the loss of mutual trust with Russia, he noted.According to Josep Borrell, EU's High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, the package comprises sanctions against 351 members of the Russia State Duma (lower house of the country's Federal Assembly) who voted to recognize the two regions.The EU will also ""target 27 individuals and entities who are playing a role in undermining or threatening Ukraine's territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence,"" he said.Furthermore, the sanctions aim to target the Russia state's ability to access the EU's capital and financial markets and services.""If Russia continues to escalate this crisis that it has created, we are ready to take further action in response,"" von der Leyen said.On the controversial Russia-Germany Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, von der Leyen said she believed that the Germany government was ""absolutely right"" to stop the project, which must be assessed in light of the security of energy supply for all of EU.""This crisis shows that EU is still too dependent on Russia gas. We have to diversify our suppliers and massively invest in renewables. This is a strategic investment in our energy independence,"" she said.The conflict in eastern Ukraine began in April 2014 with fightings between the Ukraine government troops and local armed groups who seized several towns.With the mediation of the global community, the two sides in Belarus' capital of Minsk reached ceasefire agreements in September 2014 and February 2015 respectively.Russia has been seeking NATO's guarantee to halt eastward expansion. However, U.S. President Joe Biden's administration took a hard line against Russia, supporting Ukraine's efforts to join the U.S.-led military alliance and increasing its military assistance to Ukraine, which has re-escalated tensions in the region.The situation in eastern Ukraine has been getting worse since Feb. 17, as the Ukraine government and local armed groups blamed each other for launching aggressive bombards.",WORLD,EUROPE,"European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen makes a statement on the Ukraine issue in Brussels, Belgium, on Feb. 22, 2022.

Ukraine refused to recognize their self-proclaimed status.Calling Russia's move ""the beginning of a Russia invasion of Ukraine,"" Joe Biden said in remarks delivered from the White House that his administration will impose sanctions on two Russia financial institutions - the VEB and the country's military bank -- as well as on Russia's sovereign debt and three individuals.He explained that the measure ""means we've cut off Russia's government from West financing.

411,"US hardly leads the West out of helplessness, but is in fact the cause",Zhao Minghao,2022-02-23,"The Munich Security Conference 2022 was held under the shadow of multiple challenges including the Ukraine crisis. The Munich Security Index 2022 shows perceptions of risk that pervade the societies of G7 countries due to COVID-19 pandemic, geopolitical tensions, domestic political polarization, and rising inequality. As the Munich Security Report 2022 points out, many West people believe that they are living in a ""new era of successive and interconnected disruptions,"" and there is a growing ""collective helplessness.""Such helplessness comes from domestic political dysfunction. Economic inequality, ethnic tensions, and intergenerational conflicts are old problems that become even worse in a polarized political environment. The stagnation of political reforms has largely contributed to ""crisis fatigue"" within the G7 countries mentioned in the Munich Security Report 2022. People feel less confident in their governments. According to a recent NBC News poll, only 22 percent answered that things are ""headed in the right direction.""The trend toward the retreat of democracy continues, warned Wolfgang Ischinger, chairman of the Munich Security Conference. The ""illiberal movement"" within the West is worsening, and there are challenges like populism and neo-fascism. US leadership in the West has been damaged due to its domestic illiberal movement. During the Joe Biden presidency, the US is more divided under the crisis of democracy. Helplessness stems from the external challenges West countries face, which are often self-imposed. NATO enlargement and the EU's expansion eastward are the key factors influencing Russia's strong responses to the Ukraine crisis, according to John Mearsheimer, professor at the University of Chicago. He pointed out that the Ukraine crisis is the West's fault as the West had been moving into Russia's backyard and threatening its core strategic interests. Indeed, Ukraine has the right to make a choice, but that choice should not expose its neighbor to a major security threat. Given the US and EU interference in Ukraine, it's hard to argue that Kiev's choice is truly ""independent."" Leaked classified documents show that senior US officials like Victoria Nuland, US' current under secretary of state for political affairs, have been weighing in on the make-up of the Ukraine government. For the US, the survival of NATO depends on deliberately created geopolitical tensions. The Obama administration's actions during the Russo-Georgian War and the Joe Biden administration's moves during the recent Ukraine crisis show to the world a rattled US government. ""Helpless"" EU must realize that there is indeed a geopolitical factor. Some EU countries, including Germany, seem to be interested in participating in the geopolitical game in the Indo-Pacific region, following US to provoke Beijing on the Taiwan question. This will bring them into trouble. Another contribution to the West's helplessness is the Afghanistan issue. With the hasty withdrawal of the US troops from Afghanistan, the humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan is getting worse because of the de facto US sanctions against the Taliban. The West does have a sense of frustration over Afghanistan, but it cannot be allowed to shrug off its responsibility in an immoral matter. The West is facing what former EU Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker called a ""polycrisis."" The US is hardly leading the West out of helplessness, and is in fact the cause. As the Munich Security Report 2022 emphasizes, collectively, they have the chance to turn the tide. Individually they risk being swept away. EU needs to make efforts to this end, especially to persuade US not to indulge in confrontations with China and Russia. The author is a senior fellow at the Charhar Institute and China Forum Expert at Tsinghua University. opinion@globaltimes.com.cn",OPINION,VIEWPOINT,"Outgoing Munich Security Conference Chairman Wolfgang Ischinger speaks at the end of the Munich Security Conference (MSC) in Munich, southern Germany, on February 20, 2022.

412,Can US’ balancing strategy last after Ukraine crisis?,Ding Gang,2022-02-23,"On February 21, 1972, US President Richard Nixon came to Beijing to begin a ""world-changing"" visit. He became the first sitting US president to visit China.On February 28, China and the US issued the Shanghai Joint Communiqué, which laid the foundation for the subsequent development of US-China relations.Twenty years ago, in February 2002, I interviewed Dr Kissinger in New York. Over the past two days, I have gone over my notes from that interview and have been filled with emotion.The China-US relationship seems to have gone through a strange circle, from breaking the ice in 1972, to steadily rising to a warm point in 2002, and then beginning to freeze again.The world is also in the midst of dramatic change. From Chairman Mao Zedong's handshake with President Nixon, to former President Donald Trump's ""decoupling"" with, to China-Russia back-to-back partnership today, and the outbreak of the Ukraine crisis, great powers are beginning to reorganize.I clearly remember Dr Kissinger telling me at the time that the breakthrough in the Shanghai Communiqué was largely due to a mutual recognition that establishing direct contacts was possible and in the interest of both sides.Kissinger said President Nixon made the goal of establishing diplomatic relations with China an integral part of his international strategy as soon as he took office. The China side had the same consideration.According to Kissinger, there were also concerns on the China side at the time about the threat from the Soviet Union. Those were the two bases on which the Shanghai Communiqué made its breakthrough. The basic spirit of the communiqué, in his view, was to establish a direct cooperative relationship between the US and China.The two foundations Dr Kissinger spoke of reflect his idea of a balanced strategy. The central idea of his book World Order was that a balance of power based on the Peace of Westphalia was the key to avoiding war and building peace.This idea of strategic balance still influences US's global strategy today, and the adjustment of US policy toward China clearly comes from this idea.In recent years, some in US have insisted that the US-China relationship is headed for a breakdown because China has adopted a more aggressive strategy of foreign expansion, undermining the order that the US has worked on for years to establish in the Asia-Pacific region and is upsetting the global balance of power.Some US scholars also cited Kissinger's advice before Nixon's visit to China 50 years ago.According to declassified documents, Kissinger told Nixon at the time that the US should ""play the balance of power game without any emotion.""Kissinger also predicted that in 20 years, China would be ""even more powerful"" and reminded the US president at that time to consider how to rely on Russia to keep China down.Such a balance of power game is to create a US-led structure to balance the relationship between global powers. Essentially it is not about trying to cooperate with the other side, but to ensure that the US can suppress and dismantle the other side in order to achieve US hegemony. Such a balancing structure will eventually force many small and medium-sized countries to choose sides. The crisis in Ukraine, which has gone so far, is a typical example.However, after China's peaceful rise, such a balancing strategy has become increasingly difficult to achieve. China and the US have become increasingly interdependent over the course of the past 50 years, and it is clear that their relationship is no longer tempered by equilibrium. Any forces that US would like to leverage to reorganize the so-called balance will hardly stop China's continued development.Fifty years ago, the US-China relationship made a breakthrough because of the US balancing strategy, and now, 50 years later, the relationship is beginning to ""decouple."" This is because, in US's balanced strategy, it has never seen itself as a party that can be on an equal footing with its so-called rivals, but always calculating how to prevent other countries from challenging its hegemonic position.The author is a senior editor with People's Daily, and currently a senior fellow with the Chongyang Institute for Financial Studies at Renmin University of China. dinggang@globaltimes.com.cn.

413,"All sides should give Russia, Ukraine some space to resolve issue: Global Times editorial",Global Times,2022-02-23,"Russia President Vladimir Putin on Monday signed two decrees recognizing ""the Lugansk (LPR)"" and ""the Donetsk (DPR)"" as independent and sovereign states. Ukraine decided to recall its charge d'affairs in Russia and will reconsider its diplomatic relations with Russia. The sudden change in the Ukraine situation has aroused great concern around the world. In this regard, China State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi said on Tuesday that the legitimate security concerns of any country must be respected, and the purposes and principles of the UN Charter must be upheld. He said China once again called on all parties to exercise restraint, appreciate the importance of implementing the principle of indivisible security, and de-escalate the situation and resolve differences through dialogue and negotiations.It should be noted that it is very regrettable that the Ukraine issue has evolved so far. The US has continued its intensive containment on Russia, which finally forced Russia to try to realize its security demands in such a way. This is the outburst of the dissatisfaction of the party whose security demands have been ignored for a long time since the end of the Cold War. The situation in Ukraine is deteriorating. At this time, the international community cannot discard its efforts for peace and to avoid further escalating the situation.The prospect of the situation between Russia and Ukraine remains highly uncertain. The US and West countries immediately condemned Russia's move. The White House officials said further ""coordinated"" sanctions directed at Russia would be announced on Tuesday. UN Secretary-General António Guterres said Russia's decision is ""a violation of the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Ukraine and inconsistent with the principles of the Charter of the UN."" He called for addressing ""all issues peacefully."" Many countries said they should not give up diplomatic means to peacefully solve the problem and underlined that ""constructive diplomacy is the need of the hour.""The Russia-Ukraine crisis is a dual crisis, in which bilateral conflicts between Russia and Ukraine are intertwined with the strategic suppression that NATO's eastward expansion has brought to Russia. All relevant parties have put forward their own security demands before. Although no consensus was reached, that doesn't necessarily mean a complete breakup of negotiations. It hasn't reached the point that the issue must be solved by war. Whether the situation will further escalate next mainly depends on the scale of the US sanctions imposed on Russia and whether Russia will be provoked to take more aggressive measures.Peace and no war is in the biggest and common interests of all countries in the EU continent. In this sense, only by achieving a soft landing for the Russia-Ukraine crisis can EU realize peace. True security should be inalienable, common, integrated, cooperative and sustainable. This means all sides' security interests should be respected and safeguarded, and if any party's security concerns are ignored or even trampled on, geopolitical disputes will continue and never cease. The knot must be untied by the one who tied it. Russia and Ukraine need to have face-to-face dialogues. The US and NATO should be pulled back from the Russia-Ukraine crisis as much as possible and there should be no more complicated elements added to influence the situation.In particular, at a time when the situation is uncertain, all sides should leave some space for Russia and Ukraine to solve the problems. Confrontation, sanctions, or even a direct battle will not help ease tensions. The flames scattered in eastern Ukraine are reminding all parties of the fact that blindly imposing pressure will only lead to an escalation of conflicts. What is most needed there are restraints and rationality, as well as constructive efforts of the international community.   China has no self-interest in the Ukraine issue. It has always upheld a fair and responsible attitude and will decide its own position based on the merits of the matter itself. Although all parties have different views on the Ukraine crisis, the top priority now is to avoid any actions that could intensify tensions. The international community should reach such a consensus as soon as possible. The development of the Ukraine situation is the result of a series of complex factors. Now that it has come to the brink of a cliff, all parties should work together to pull it back.",OPINION,EDITORIAL,"United Nations Security Council meets after Russia recognized two breakaway regions in eastern Ukraine as independent entities, in New York City on Monday.

417,"EU agrees Russia sanctions package, warns of further action",Xinhua,2022-02-23," The EU (EU) is ready to take further action against Russia if it continues to escalate the crisis, EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen warned here on Tuesday.In a statement, von der Leyen said EU member states had given their political consent to a new package of sanctions against Russia following its recognition of the independence of the Ukraine regions of Donetsk and Luhansk.The package contains a number of ""calibrated measures"" targeting banks that finance the Russia military apparatus and contribute to the destabilization of Ukraine.It also bans trade between the two breakaway regions and the EU, as it did with Crimea in 2014, and limits the Russia government's ability to raise capital on the EU's financial markets.Russia President Vladimir Putin on Monday evening signed decrees recognizing the independence of two self-proclaimed regions in eastern Ukraine's Donbass as ""the Lugansk (LPR)"" and ""the Donetsk (DPR).""Russia has done everything to preserve the territorial integrity of Ukraine by fighting for the implementation of 2015 Minsk agreement, but all the efforts ended up in vain, Vladimir Putin said on Monday.The security crisis occurred due to NATO's eastward expansion, which has led to the loss of mutual trust with Russia, he noted.According to Josep Borrell, EU's High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, the package comprises sanctions against 351 members of the Russia State Duma (lower house of the country's Federal Assembly) who voted to recognize the two regions.The EU will also ""target 27 individuals and entities who are playing a role in undermining or threatening Ukraine's territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence,"" he said.Furthermore, the sanctions aim to target the Russia state's ability to access the EU's capital and financial markets and services.""If Russia continues to escalate this crisis that it has created, we are ready to take further action in response,"" von der Leyen said.On the controversial Russia-Germany Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, von der Leyen said she believed that the Germany government was ""absolutely right"" to stop the project, which must be assessed in light of the security of energy supply for all of EU.""This crisis shows that EU is still too dependent on Russia gas. We have to diversify our suppliers and massively invest in renewables. This is a strategic investment in our energy independence,"" she said.The conflict in eastern Ukraine began in April 2014 with fightings between the Ukraine government troops and local armed groups who seized several towns.With the mediation of the global community, the two sides in Belarus' capital of Minsk reached ceasefire agreements in September 2014 and February 2015 respectively.Russia has been seeking NATO's guarantee to halt eastward expansion. However, U.S. President Joe Biden's administration took a hard line against Russia, supporting Ukraine's efforts to join the U.S.-led military alliance and increasing its military assistance to Ukraine, which has re-escalated tensions in the region.The situation in eastern Ukraine has been getting worse since Feb. 17, as the Ukraine government and local armed groups blamed each other for launching aggressive bombards.",WORLD,EUROPE,"European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen makes a statement on the Ukraine issue in Brussels, Belgium, on Feb. 22, 2022.

Ukraine refused to recognize their self-proclaimed status.Calling Russia's move ""the beginning of a Russia invasion of Ukraine,"" Joe Biden said in remarks delivered from the White House that his administration will impose sanctions on two Russia financial institutions - the VEB and the country's military bank -- as well as on Russia's sovereign debt and three individuals.He explained that the measure ""means we've cut off Russia's government from West financing.

421,"US hardly leads the West out of helplessness, but is in fact the cause",Zhao Minghao,2022-02-23,"The Munich Security Conference 2022 was held under the shadow of multiple challenges including the Ukraine crisis. The Munich Security Index 2022 shows perceptions of risk that pervade the societies of G7 countries due to COVID-19 pandemic, geopolitical tensions, domestic political polarization, and rising inequality. As the Munich Security Report 2022 points out, many West people believe that they are living in a ""new era of successive and interconnected disruptions,"" and there is a growing ""collective helplessness.""Such helplessness comes from domestic political dysfunction. Economic inequality, ethnic tensions, and intergenerational conflicts are old problems that become even worse in a polarized political environment. The stagnation of political reforms has largely contributed to ""crisis fatigue"" within the G7 countries mentioned in the Munich Security Report 2022. People feel less confident in their governments. According to a recent NBC News poll, only 22 percent answered that things are ""headed in the right direction.""The trend toward the retreat of democracy continues, warned Wolfgang Ischinger, chairman of the Munich Security Conference. The ""illiberal movement"" within the West is worsening, and there are challenges like populism and neo-fascism. US leadership in the West has been damaged due to its domestic illiberal movement. During the Joe Biden presidency, the US is more divided under the crisis of democracy. Helplessness stems from the external challenges West countries face, which are often self-imposed. NATO enlargement and the EU's expansion eastward are the key factors influencing Russia's strong responses to the Ukraine crisis, according to John Mearsheimer, professor at the University of Chicago. He pointed out that the Ukraine crisis is the West's fault as the West had been moving into Russia's backyard and threatening its core strategic interests. Indeed, Ukraine has the right to make a choice, but that choice should not expose its neighbor to a major security threat. Given the US and EU interference in Ukraine, it's hard to argue that Kiev's choice is truly ""independent."" Leaked classified documents show that senior US officials like Victoria Nuland, US' current under secretary of state for political affairs, have been weighing in on the make-up of the Ukraine government. For the US, the survival of NATO depends on deliberately created geopolitical tensions. The Obama administration's actions during the Russo-Georgian War and the Joe Biden administration's moves during the recent Ukraine crisis show to the world a rattled US government. ""Helpless"" EU must realize that there is indeed a geopolitical factor. Some EU countries, including Germany, seem to be interested in participating in the geopolitical game in the Indo-Pacific region, following US to provoke Beijing on the Taiwan question. This will bring them into trouble. Another contribution to the West's helplessness is the Afghanistan issue. With the hasty withdrawal of the US troops from Afghanistan, the humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan is getting worse because of the de facto US sanctions against the Taliban. The West does have a sense of frustration over Afghanistan, but it cannot be allowed to shrug off its responsibility in an immoral matter. The West is facing what former EU Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker called a ""polycrisis."" The US is hardly leading the West out of helplessness, and is in fact the cause. As the Munich Security Report 2022 emphasizes, collectively, they have the chance to turn the tide. Individually they risk being swept away. EU needs to make efforts to this end, especially to persuade US not to indulge in confrontations with China and Russia. The author is a senior fellow at the Charhar Institute and China Forum Expert at Tsinghua University. opinion@globaltimes.com.cn",OPINION,VIEWPOINT,"Outgoing Munich Security Conference Chairman Wolfgang Ischinger speaks at the end of the Munich Security Conference (MSC) in Munich, southern Germany, on February 20, 2022.

422,Can US’ balancing strategy last after Ukraine crisis?,Ding Gang,2022-02-23,"On February 21, 1972, US President Richard Nixon came to Beijing to begin a ""world-changing"" visit. He became the first sitting US president to visit China.On February 28, China and the US issued the Shanghai Joint Communiqué, which laid the foundation for the subsequent development of US-China relations.Twenty years ago, in February 2002, I interviewed Dr Kissinger in New York. Over the past two days, I have gone over my notes from that interview and have been filled with emotion.The China-US relationship seems to have gone through a strange circle, from breaking the ice in 1972, to steadily rising to a warm point in 2002, and then beginning to freeze again.The world is also in the midst of dramatic change. From Chairman Mao Zedong's handshake with President Nixon, to former President Donald Trump's ""decoupling"" with, to China-Russia back-to-back partnership today, and the outbreak of the Ukraine crisis, great powers are beginning to reorganize.I clearly remember Dr Kissinger telling me at the time that the breakthrough in the Shanghai Communiqué was largely due to a mutual recognition that establishing direct contacts was possible and in the interest of both sides.Kissinger said President Nixon made the goal of establishing diplomatic relations with China an integral part of his international strategy as soon as he took office. The China side had the same consideration.According to Kissinger, there were also concerns on the China side at the time about the threat from the Soviet Union. Those were the two bases on which the Shanghai Communiqué made its breakthrough. The basic spirit of the communiqué, in his view, was to establish a direct cooperative relationship between the US and China.The two foundations Dr Kissinger spoke of reflect his idea of a balanced strategy. The central idea of his book World Order was that a balance of power based on the Peace of Westphalia was the key to avoiding war and building peace.This idea of strategic balance still influences US's global strategy today, and the adjustment of US policy toward China clearly comes from this idea.In recent years, some in US have insisted that the US-China relationship is headed for a breakdown because China has adopted a more aggressive strategy of foreign expansion, undermining the order that the US has worked on for years to establish in the Asia-Pacific region and is upsetting the global balance of power.Some US scholars also cited Kissinger's advice before Nixon's visit to China 50 years ago.According to declassified documents, Kissinger told Nixon at the time that the US should ""play the balance of power game without any emotion.""Kissinger also predicted that in 20 years, China would be ""even more powerful"" and reminded the US president at that time to consider how to rely on Russia to keep China down.Such a balance of power game is to create a US-led structure to balance the relationship between global powers. Essentially it is not about trying to cooperate with the other side, but to ensure that the US can suppress and dismantle the other side in order to achieve US hegemony. Such a balancing structure will eventually force many small and medium-sized countries to choose sides. The crisis in Ukraine, which has gone so far, is a typical example.However, after China's peaceful rise, such a balancing strategy has become increasingly difficult to achieve. China and the US have become increasingly interdependent over the course of the past 50 years, and it is clear that their relationship is no longer tempered by equilibrium. Any forces that US would like to leverage to reorganize the so-called balance will hardly stop China's continued development.Fifty years ago, the US-China relationship made a breakthrough because of the US balancing strategy, and now, 50 years later, the relationship is beginning to ""decouple."" This is because, in US's balanced strategy, it has never seen itself as a party that can be on an equal footing with its so-called rivals, but always calculating how to prevent other countries from challenging its hegemonic position.The author is a senior editor with People's Daily, and currently a senior fellow with the Chongyang Institute for Financial Studies at Renmin University of China. dinggang@globaltimes.com.cn.

423,"All sides should give Russia, Ukraine some space to resolve issue: Global Times editorial",Global Times,2022-02-23,"Russia President Vladimir Putin on Monday signed two decrees recognizing ""the Lugansk (LPR)"" and ""the Donetsk (DPR)"" as independent and sovereign states. Ukraine decided to recall its charge d'affairs in Russia and will reconsider its diplomatic relations with Russia. The sudden change in the Ukraine situation has aroused great concern around the world. In this regard, China State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi said on Tuesday that the legitimate security concerns of any country must be respected, and the purposes and principles of the UN Charter must be upheld. He said China once again called on all parties to exercise restraint, appreciate the importance of implementing the principle of indivisible security, and de-escalate the situation and resolve differences through dialogue and negotiations.It should be noted that it is very regrettable that the Ukraine issue has evolved so far. The US has continued its intensive containment on Russia, which finally forced Russia to try to realize its security demands in such a way. This is the outburst of the dissatisfaction of the party whose security demands have been ignored for a long time since the end of the Cold War. The situation in Ukraine is deteriorating. At this time, the international community cannot discard its efforts for peace and to avoid further escalating the situation.The prospect of the situation between Russia and Ukraine remains highly uncertain. The US and West countries immediately condemned Russia's move. The White House officials said further ""coordinated"" sanctions directed at Russia would be announced on Tuesday. UN Secretary-General António Guterres said Russia's decision is ""a violation of the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Ukraine and inconsistent with the principles of the Charter of the UN."" He called for addressing ""all issues peacefully."" Many countries said they should not give up diplomatic means to peacefully solve the problem and underlined that ""constructive diplomacy is the need of the hour.""The Russia-Ukraine crisis is a dual crisis, in which bilateral conflicts between Russia and Ukraine are intertwined with the strategic suppression that NATO's eastward expansion has brought to Russia. All relevant parties have put forward their own security demands before. Although no consensus was reached, that doesn't necessarily mean a complete breakup of negotiations. It hasn't reached the point that the issue must be solved by war. Whether the situation will further escalate next mainly depends on the scale of the US sanctions imposed on Russia and whether Russia will be provoked to take more aggressive measures.Peace and no war is in the biggest and common interests of all countries in the EU continent. In this sense, only by achieving a soft landing for the Russia-Ukraine crisis can EU realize peace. True security should be inalienable, common, integrated, cooperative and sustainable. This means all sides' security interests should be respected and safeguarded, and if any party's security concerns are ignored or even trampled on, geopolitical disputes will continue and never cease. The knot must be untied by the one who tied it. Russia and Ukraine need to have face-to-face dialogues. The US and NATO should be pulled back from the Russia-Ukraine crisis as much as possible and there should be no more complicated elements added to influence the situation.In particular, at a time when the situation is uncertain, all sides should leave some space for Russia and Ukraine to solve the problems. Confrontation, sanctions, or even a direct battle will not help ease tensions. The flames scattered in eastern Ukraine are reminding all parties of the fact that blindly imposing pressure will only lead to an escalation of conflicts. What is most needed there are restraints and rationality, as well as constructive efforts of the international community.   China has no self-interest in the Ukraine issue. It has always upheld a fair and responsible attitude and will decide its own position based on the merits of the matter itself. Although all parties have different views on the Ukraine crisis, the top priority now is to avoid any actions that could intensify tensions. The international community should reach such a consensus as soon as possible. The development of the Ukraine situation is the result of a series of complex factors. Now that it has come to the brink of a cliff, all parties should work together to pull it back.",OPINION,EDITORIAL,"United Nations Security Council meets after Russia recognized two breakaway regions in eastern Ukraine as independent entities, in New York City on Monday.

427,"EU agrees Russia sanctions package, warns of further action",Xinhua,2022-02-23," The EU (EU) is ready to take further action against Russia if it continues to escalate the crisis, EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen warned here on Tuesday.In a statement, von der Leyen said EU member states had given their political consent to a new package of sanctions against Russia following its recognition of the independence of the Ukraine regions of Donetsk and Luhansk.The package contains a number of ""calibrated measures"" targeting banks that finance the Russia military apparatus and contribute to the destabilization of Ukraine.It also bans trade between the two breakaway regions and the EU, as it did with Crimea in 2014, and limits the Russia government's ability to raise capital on the EU's financial markets.Russia President Vladimir Putin on Monday evening signed decrees recognizing the independence of two self-proclaimed regions in eastern Ukraine's Donbass as ""the Lugansk (LPR)"" and ""the Donetsk (DPR).""Russia has done everything to preserve the territorial integrity of Ukraine by fighting for the implementation of 2015 Minsk agreement, but all the efforts ended up in vain, Vladimir Putin said on Monday.The security crisis occurred due to NATO's eastward expansion, which has led to the loss of mutual trust with Russia, he noted.According to Josep Borrell, EU's High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, the package comprises sanctions against 351 members of the Russia State Duma (lower house of the country's Federal Assembly) who voted to recognize the two regions.The EU will also ""target 27 individuals and entities who are playing a role in undermining or threatening Ukraine's territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence,"" he said.Furthermore, the sanctions aim to target the Russia state's ability to access the EU's capital and financial markets and services.""If Russia continues to escalate this crisis that it has created, we are ready to take further action in response,"" von der Leyen said.On the controversial Russia-Germany Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, von der Leyen said she believed that the Germany government was ""absolutely right"" to stop the project, which must be assessed in light of the security of energy supply for all of EU.""This crisis shows that EU is still too dependent on Russia gas. We have to diversify our suppliers and massively invest in renewables. This is a strategic investment in our energy independence,"" she said.The conflict in eastern Ukraine began in April 2014 with fightings between the Ukraine government troops and local armed groups who seized several towns.With the mediation of the global community, the two sides in Belarus' capital of Minsk reached ceasefire agreements in September 2014 and February 2015 respectively.Russia has been seeking NATO's guarantee to halt eastward expansion. However, U.S. President Joe Biden's administration took a hard line against Russia, supporting Ukraine's efforts to join the U.S.-led military alliance and increasing its military assistance to Ukraine, which has re-escalated tensions in the region.The situation in eastern Ukraine has been getting worse since Feb. 17, as the Ukraine government and local armed groups blamed each other for launching aggressive bombards.",WORLD,EUROPE,"European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen makes a statement on the Ukraine issue in Brussels, Belgium, on Feb. 22, 2022.

Ukraine refused to recognize their self-proclaimed status.Calling Russia's move ""the beginning of a Russia invasion of Ukraine,"" Joe Biden said in remarks delivered from the White House that his administration will impose sanctions on two Russia financial institutions - the VEB and the country's military bank -- as well as on Russia's sovereign debt and three individuals.He explained that the measure ""means we've cut off Russia's government from West financing.

431,"US hardly leads the West out of helplessness, but is in fact the cause",Zhao Minghao,2022-02-23,"The Munich Security Conference 2022 was held under the shadow of multiple challenges including the Ukraine crisis. The Munich Security Index 2022 shows perceptions of risk that pervade the societies of G7 countries due to COVID-19 pandemic, geopolitical tensions, domestic political polarization, and rising inequality. As the Munich Security Report 2022 points out, many West people believe that they are living in a ""new era of successive and interconnected disruptions,"" and there is a growing ""collective helplessness.""Such helplessness comes from domestic political dysfunction. Economic inequality, ethnic tensions, and intergenerational conflicts are old problems that become even worse in a polarized political environment. The stagnation of political reforms has largely contributed to ""crisis fatigue"" within the G7 countries mentioned in the Munich Security Report 2022. People feel less confident in their governments. According to a recent NBC News poll, only 22 percent answered that things are ""headed in the right direction.""The trend toward the retreat of democracy continues, warned Wolfgang Ischinger, chairman of the Munich Security Conference. The ""illiberal movement"" within the West is worsening, and there are challenges like populism and neo-fascism. US leadership in the West has been damaged due to its domestic illiberal movement. During the Joe Biden presidency, the US is more divided under the crisis of democracy. Helplessness stems from the external challenges West countries face, which are often self-imposed. NATO enlargement and the EU's expansion eastward are the key factors influencing Russia's strong responses to the Ukraine crisis, according to John Mearsheimer, professor at the University of Chicago. He pointed out that the Ukraine crisis is the West's fault as the West had been moving into Russia's backyard and threatening its core strategic interests. Indeed, Ukraine has the right to make a choice, but that choice should not expose its neighbor to a major security threat. Given the US and EU interference in Ukraine, it's hard to argue that Kiev's choice is truly ""independent."" Leaked classified documents show that senior US officials like Victoria Nuland, US' current under secretary of state for political affairs, have been weighing in on the make-up of the Ukraine government. For the US, the survival of NATO depends on deliberately created geopolitical tensions. The Obama administration's actions during the Russo-Georgian War and the Joe Biden administration's moves during the recent Ukraine crisis show to the world a rattled US government. ""Helpless"" EU must realize that there is indeed a geopolitical factor. Some EU countries, including Germany, seem to be interested in participating in the geopolitical game in the Indo-Pacific region, following US to provoke Beijing on the Taiwan question. This will bring them into trouble. Another contribution to the West's helplessness is the Afghanistan issue. With the hasty withdrawal of the US troops from Afghanistan, the humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan is getting worse because of the de facto US sanctions against the Taliban. The West does have a sense of frustration over Afghanistan, but it cannot be allowed to shrug off its responsibility in an immoral matter. The West is facing what former EU Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker called a ""polycrisis."" The US is hardly leading the West out of helplessness, and is in fact the cause. As the Munich Security Report 2022 emphasizes, collectively, they have the chance to turn the tide. Individually they risk being swept away. EU needs to make efforts to this end, especially to persuade US not to indulge in confrontations with China and Russia. The author is a senior fellow at the Charhar Institute and China Forum Expert at Tsinghua University. opinion@globaltimes.com.cn",OPINION,VIEWPOINT,"Outgoing Munich Security Conference Chairman Wolfgang Ischinger speaks at the end of the Munich Security Conference (MSC) in Munich, southern Germany, on February 20, 2022.

432,Can US’ balancing strategy last after Ukraine crisis?,Ding Gang,2022-02-23,"On February 21, 1972, US President Richard Nixon came to Beijing to begin a ""world-changing"" visit. He became the first sitting US president to visit China.On February 28, China and the US issued the Shanghai Joint Communiqué, which laid the foundation for the subsequent development of US-China relations.Twenty years ago, in February 2002, I interviewed Dr Kissinger in New York. Over the past two days, I have gone over my notes from that interview and have been filled with emotion.The China-US relationship seems to have gone through a strange circle, from breaking the ice in 1972, to steadily rising to a warm point in 2002, and then beginning to freeze again.The world is also in the midst of dramatic change. From Chairman Mao Zedong's handshake with President Nixon, to former President Donald Trump's ""decoupling"" with, to China-Russia back-to-back partnership today, and the outbreak of the Ukraine crisis, great powers are beginning to reorganize.I clearly remember Dr Kissinger telling me at the time that the breakthrough in the Shanghai Communiqué was largely due to a mutual recognition that establishing direct contacts was possible and in the interest of both sides.Kissinger said President Nixon made the goal of establishing diplomatic relations with China an integral part of his international strategy as soon as he took office. The China side had the same consideration.According to Kissinger, there were also concerns on the China side at the time about the threat from the Soviet Union. Those were the two bases on which the Shanghai Communiqué made its breakthrough. The basic spirit of the communiqué, in his view, was to establish a direct cooperative relationship between the US and China.The two foundations Dr Kissinger spoke of reflect his idea of a balanced strategy. The central idea of his book World Order was that a balance of power based on the Peace of Westphalia was the key to avoiding war and building peace.This idea of strategic balance still influences US's global strategy today, and the adjustment of US policy toward China clearly comes from this idea.In recent years, some in US have insisted that the US-China relationship is headed for a breakdown because China has adopted a more aggressive strategy of foreign expansion, undermining the order that the US has worked on for years to establish in the Asia-Pacific region and is upsetting the global balance of power.Some US scholars also cited Kissinger's advice before Nixon's visit to China 50 years ago.According to declassified documents, Kissinger told Nixon at the time that the US should ""play the balance of power game without any emotion.""Kissinger also predicted that in 20 years, China would be ""even more powerful"" and reminded the US president at that time to consider how to rely on Russia to keep China down.Such a balance of power game is to create a US-led structure to balance the relationship between global powers. Essentially it is not about trying to cooperate with the other side, but to ensure that the US can suppress and dismantle the other side in order to achieve US hegemony. Such a balancing structure will eventually force many small and medium-sized countries to choose sides. The crisis in Ukraine, which has gone so far, is a typical example.However, after China's peaceful rise, such a balancing strategy has become increasingly difficult to achieve. China and the US have become increasingly interdependent over the course of the past 50 years, and it is clear that their relationship is no longer tempered by equilibrium. Any forces that US would like to leverage to reorganize the so-called balance will hardly stop China's continued development.Fifty years ago, the US-China relationship made a breakthrough because of the US balancing strategy, and now, 50 years later, the relationship is beginning to ""decouple."" This is because, in US's balanced strategy, it has never seen itself as a party that can be on an equal footing with its so-called rivals, but always calculating how to prevent other countries from challenging its hegemonic position.The author is a senior editor with People's Daily, and currently a senior fellow with the Chongyang Institute for Financial Studies at Renmin University of China. dinggang@globaltimes.com.cn.

433,"All sides should give Russia, Ukraine some space to resolve issue: Global Times editorial",Global Times,2022-02-23,"Russia President Vladimir Putin on Monday signed two decrees recognizing ""the Lugansk (LPR)"" and ""the Donetsk (DPR)"" as independent and sovereign states. Ukraine decided to recall its charge d'affairs in Russia and will reconsider its diplomatic relations with Russia. The sudden change in the Ukraine situation has aroused great concern around the world. In this regard, China State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi said on Tuesday that the legitimate security concerns of any country must be respected, and the purposes and principles of the UN Charter must be upheld. He said China once again called on all parties to exercise restraint, appreciate the importance of implementing the principle of indivisible security, and de-escalate the situation and resolve differences through dialogue and negotiations.It should be noted that it is very regrettable that the Ukraine issue has evolved so far. The US has continued its intensive containment on Russia, which finally forced Russia to try to realize its security demands in such a way. This is the outburst of the dissatisfaction of the party whose security demands have been ignored for a long time since the end of the Cold War. The situation in Ukraine is deteriorating. At this time, the international community cannot discard its efforts for peace and to avoid further escalating the situation.The prospect of the situation between Russia and Ukraine remains highly uncertain. The US and West countries immediately condemned Russia's move. The White House officials said further ""coordinated"" sanctions directed at Russia would be announced on Tuesday. UN Secretary-General António Guterres said Russia's decision is ""a violation of the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Ukraine and inconsistent with the principles of the Charter of the UN."" He called for addressing ""all issues peacefully."" Many countries said they should not give up diplomatic means to peacefully solve the problem and underlined that ""constructive diplomacy is the need of the hour.""The Russia-Ukraine crisis is a dual crisis, in which bilateral conflicts between Russia and Ukraine are intertwined with the strategic suppression that NATO's eastward expansion has brought to Russia. All relevant parties have put forward their own security demands before. Although no consensus was reached, that doesn't necessarily mean a complete breakup of negotiations. It hasn't reached the point that the issue must be solved by war. Whether the situation will further escalate next mainly depends on the scale of the US sanctions imposed on Russia and whether Russia will be provoked to take more aggressive measures.Peace and no war is in the biggest and common interests of all countries in the EU continent. In this sense, only by achieving a soft landing for the Russia-Ukraine crisis can EU realize peace. True security should be inalienable, common, integrated, cooperative and sustainable. This means all sides' security interests should be respected and safeguarded, and if any party's security concerns are ignored or even trampled on, geopolitical disputes will continue and never cease. The knot must be untied by the one who tied it. Russia and Ukraine need to have face-to-face dialogues. The US and NATO should be pulled back from the Russia-Ukraine crisis as much as possible and there should be no more complicated elements added to influence the situation.In particular, at a time when the situation is uncertain, all sides should leave some space for Russia and Ukraine to solve the problems. Confrontation, sanctions, or even a direct battle will not help ease tensions. The flames scattered in eastern Ukraine are reminding all parties of the fact that blindly imposing pressure will only lead to an escalation of conflicts. What is most needed there are restraints and rationality, as well as constructive efforts of the international community.   China has no self-interest in the Ukraine issue. It has always upheld a fair and responsible attitude and will decide its own position based on the merits of the matter itself. Although all parties have different views on the Ukraine crisis, the top priority now is to avoid any actions that could intensify tensions. The international community should reach such a consensus as soon as possible. The development of the Ukraine situation is the result of a series of complex factors. Now that it has come to the brink of a cliff, all parties should work together to pull it back.",OPINION,EDITORIAL,"United Nations Security Council meets after Russia recognized two breakaway regions in eastern Ukraine as independent entities, in New York City on Monday.

437,"EU agrees Russia sanctions package, warns of further action",Xinhua,2022-02-23," The EU (EU) is ready to take further action against Russia if it continues to escalate the crisis, EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen warned here on Tuesday.In a statement, von der Leyen said EU member states had given their political consent to a new package of sanctions against Russia following its recognition of the independence of the Ukraine regions of Donetsk and Luhansk.The package contains a number of ""calibrated measures"" targeting banks that finance the Russia military apparatus and contribute to the destabilization of Ukraine.It also bans trade between the two breakaway regions and the EU, as it did with Crimea in 2014, and limits the Russia government's ability to raise capital on the EU's financial markets.Russia President Vladimir Putin on Monday evening signed decrees recognizing the independence of two self-proclaimed regions in eastern Ukraine's Donbass as ""the Lugansk (LPR)"" and ""the Donetsk (DPR).""Russia has done everything to preserve the territorial integrity of Ukraine by fighting for the implementation of 2015 Minsk agreement, but all the efforts ended up in vain, Vladimir Putin said on Monday.The security crisis occurred due to NATO's eastward expansion, which has led to the loss of mutual trust with Russia, he noted.According to Josep Borrell, EU's High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, the package comprises sanctions against 351 members of the Russia State Duma (lower house of the country's Federal Assembly) who voted to recognize the two regions.The EU will also ""target 27 individuals and entities who are playing a role in undermining or threatening Ukraine's territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence,"" he said.Furthermore, the sanctions aim to target the Russia state's ability to access the EU's capital and financial markets and services.""If Russia continues to escalate this crisis that it has created, we are ready to take further action in response,"" von der Leyen said.On the controversial Russia-Germany Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, von der Leyen said she believed that the Germany government was ""absolutely right"" to stop the project, which must be assessed in light of the security of energy supply for all of EU.""This crisis shows that EU is still too dependent on Russia gas. We have to diversify our suppliers and massively invest in renewables. This is a strategic investment in our energy independence,"" she said.The conflict in eastern Ukraine began in April 2014 with fightings between the Ukraine government troops and local armed groups who seized several towns.With the mediation of the global community, the two sides in Belarus' capital of Minsk reached ceasefire agreements in September 2014 and February 2015 respectively.Russia has been seeking NATO's guarantee to halt eastward expansion. However, U.S. President Joe Biden's administration took a hard line against Russia, supporting Ukraine's efforts to join the U.S.-led military alliance and increasing its military assistance to Ukraine, which has re-escalated tensions in the region.The situation in eastern Ukraine has been getting worse since Feb. 17, as the Ukraine government and local armed groups blamed each other for launching aggressive bombards.",WORLD,EUROPE,"European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen makes a statement on the Ukraine issue in Brussels, Belgium, on Feb. 22, 2022.

Ukraine refused to recognize their self-proclaimed status.Calling Russia's move ""the beginning of a Russia invasion of Ukraine,"" Joe Biden said in remarks delivered from the White House that his administration will impose sanctions on two Russia financial institutions - the VEB and the country's military bank -- as well as on Russia's sovereign debt and three individuals.He explained that the measure ""means we've cut off Russia's government from West financing.

441,"US hardly leads the West out of helplessness, but is in fact the cause",Zhao Minghao,2022-02-23,"The Munich Security Conference 2022 was held under the shadow of multiple challenges including the Ukraine crisis. The Munich Security Index 2022 shows perceptions of risk that pervade the societies of G7 countries due to COVID-19 pandemic, geopolitical tensions, domestic political polarization, and rising inequality. As the Munich Security Report 2022 points out, many West people believe that they are living in a ""new era of successive and interconnected disruptions,"" and there is a growing ""collective helplessness.""Such helplessness comes from domestic political dysfunction. Economic inequality, ethnic tensions, and intergenerational conflicts are old problems that become even worse in a polarized political environment. The stagnation of political reforms has largely contributed to ""crisis fatigue"" within the G7 countries mentioned in the Munich Security Report 2022. People feel less confident in their governments. According to a recent NBC News poll, only 22 percent answered that things are ""headed in the right direction.""The trend toward the retreat of democracy continues, warned Wolfgang Ischinger, chairman of the Munich Security Conference. The ""illiberal movement"" within the West is worsening, and there are challenges like populism and neo-fascism. US leadership in the West has been damaged due to its domestic illiberal movement. During the Joe Biden presidency, the US is more divided under the crisis of democracy. Helplessness stems from the external challenges West countries face, which are often self-imposed. NATO enlargement and the EU's expansion eastward are the key factors influencing Russia's strong responses to the Ukraine crisis, according to John Mearsheimer, professor at the University of Chicago. He pointed out that the Ukraine crisis is the West's fault as the West had been moving into Russia's backyard and threatening its core strategic interests. Indeed, Ukraine has the right to make a choice, but that choice should not expose its neighbor to a major security threat. Given the US and EU interference in Ukraine, it's hard to argue that Kiev's choice is truly ""independent."" Leaked classified documents show that senior US officials like Victoria Nuland, US' current under secretary of state for political affairs, have been weighing in on the make-up of the Ukraine government. For the US, the survival of NATO depends on deliberately created geopolitical tensions. The Obama administration's actions during the Russo-Georgian War and the Joe Biden administration's moves during the recent Ukraine crisis show to the world a rattled US government. ""Helpless"" EU must realize that there is indeed a geopolitical factor. Some EU countries, including Germany, seem to be interested in participating in the geopolitical game in the Indo-Pacific region, following US to provoke Beijing on the Taiwan question. This will bring them into trouble. Another contribution to the West's helplessness is the Afghanistan issue. With the hasty withdrawal of the US troops from Afghanistan, the humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan is getting worse because of the de facto US sanctions against the Taliban. The West does have a sense of frustration over Afghanistan, but it cannot be allowed to shrug off its responsibility in an immoral matter. The West is facing what former EU Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker called a ""polycrisis."" The US is hardly leading the West out of helplessness, and is in fact the cause. As the Munich Security Report 2022 emphasizes, collectively, they have the chance to turn the tide. Individually they risk being swept away. EU needs to make efforts to this end, especially to persuade US not to indulge in confrontations with China and Russia. The author is a senior fellow at the Charhar Institute and China Forum Expert at Tsinghua University. opinion@globaltimes.com.cn",OPINION,VIEWPOINT,"Outgoing Munich Security Conference Chairman Wolfgang Ischinger speaks at the end of the Munich Security Conference (MSC) in Munich, southern Germany, on February 20, 2022.

442,Can US’ balancing strategy last after Ukraine crisis?,Ding Gang,2022-02-23,"On February 21, 1972, US President Richard Nixon came to Beijing to begin a ""world-changing"" visit. He became the first sitting US president to visit China.On February 28, China and the US issued the Shanghai Joint Communiqué, which laid the foundation for the subsequent development of US-China relations.Twenty years ago, in February 2002, I interviewed Dr Kissinger in New York. Over the past two days, I have gone over my notes from that interview and have been filled with emotion.The China-US relationship seems to have gone through a strange circle, from breaking the ice in 1972, to steadily rising to a warm point in 2002, and then beginning to freeze again.The world is also in the midst of dramatic change. From Chairman Mao Zedong's handshake with President Nixon, to former President Donald Trump's ""decoupling"" with, to China-Russia back-to-back partnership today, and the outbreak of the Ukraine crisis, great powers are beginning to reorganize.I clearly remember Dr Kissinger telling me at the time that the breakthrough in the Shanghai Communiqué was largely due to a mutual recognition that establishing direct contacts was possible and in the interest of both sides.Kissinger said President Nixon made the goal of establishing diplomatic relations with China an integral part of his international strategy as soon as he took office. The China side had the same consideration.According to Kissinger, there were also concerns on the China side at the time about the threat from the Soviet Union. Those were the two bases on which the Shanghai Communiqué made its breakthrough. The basic spirit of the communiqué, in his view, was to establish a direct cooperative relationship between the US and China.The two foundations Dr Kissinger spoke of reflect his idea of a balanced strategy. The central idea of his book World Order was that a balance of power based on the Peace of Westphalia was the key to avoiding war and building peace.This idea of strategic balance still influences US's global strategy today, and the adjustment of US policy toward China clearly comes from this idea.In recent years, some in US have insisted that the US-China relationship is headed for a breakdown because China has adopted a more aggressive strategy of foreign expansion, undermining the order that the US has worked on for years to establish in the Asia-Pacific region and is upsetting the global balance of power.Some US scholars also cited Kissinger's advice before Nixon's visit to China 50 years ago.According to declassified documents, Kissinger told Nixon at the time that the US should ""play the balance of power game without any emotion.""Kissinger also predicted that in 20 years, China would be ""even more powerful"" and reminded the US president at that time to consider how to rely on Russia to keep China down.Such a balance of power game is to create a US-led structure to balance the relationship between global powers. Essentially it is not about trying to cooperate with the other side, but to ensure that the US can suppress and dismantle the other side in order to achieve US hegemony. Such a balancing structure will eventually force many small and medium-sized countries to choose sides. The crisis in Ukraine, which has gone so far, is a typical example.However, after China's peaceful rise, such a balancing strategy has become increasingly difficult to achieve. China and the US have become increasingly interdependent over the course of the past 50 years, and it is clear that their relationship is no longer tempered by equilibrium. Any forces that US would like to leverage to reorganize the so-called balance will hardly stop China's continued development.Fifty years ago, the US-China relationship made a breakthrough because of the US balancing strategy, and now, 50 years later, the relationship is beginning to ""decouple."" This is because, in US's balanced strategy, it has never seen itself as a party that can be on an equal footing with its so-called rivals, but always calculating how to prevent other countries from challenging its hegemonic position.The author is a senior editor with People's Daily, and currently a senior fellow with the Chongyang Institute for Financial Studies at Renmin University of China. dinggang@globaltimes.com.cn.

443,"All sides should give Russia, Ukraine some space to resolve issue: Global Times editorial",Global Times,2022-02-23,"Russia President Vladimir Putin on Monday signed two decrees recognizing ""the Lugansk (LPR)"" and ""the Donetsk (DPR)"" as independent and sovereign states. Ukraine decided to recall its charge d'affairs in Russia and will reconsider its diplomatic relations with Russia. The sudden change in the Ukraine situation has aroused great concern around the world. In this regard, China State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi said on Tuesday that the legitimate security concerns of any country must be respected, and the purposes and principles of the UN Charter must be upheld. He said China once again called on all parties to exercise restraint, appreciate the importance of implementing the principle of indivisible security, and de-escalate the situation and resolve differences through dialogue and negotiations.It should be noted that it is very regrettable that the Ukraine issue has evolved so far. The US has continued its intensive containment on Russia, which finally forced Russia to try to realize its security demands in such a way. This is the outburst of the dissatisfaction of the party whose security demands have been ignored for a long time since the end of the Cold War. The situation in Ukraine is deteriorating. At this time, the international community cannot discard its efforts for peace and to avoid further escalating the situation.The prospect of the situation between Russia and Ukraine remains highly uncertain. The US and West countries immediately condemned Russia's move. The White House officials said further ""coordinated"" sanctions directed at Russia would be announced on Tuesday. UN Secretary-General António Guterres said Russia's decision is ""a violation of the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Ukraine and inconsistent with the principles of the Charter of the UN."" He called for addressing ""all issues peacefully."" Many countries said they should not give up diplomatic means to peacefully solve the problem and underlined that ""constructive diplomacy is the need of the hour.""The Russia-Ukraine crisis is a dual crisis, in which bilateral conflicts between Russia and Ukraine are intertwined with the strategic suppression that NATO's eastward expansion has brought to Russia. All relevant parties have put forward their own security demands before. Although no consensus was reached, that doesn't necessarily mean a complete breakup of negotiations. It hasn't reached the point that the issue must be solved by war. Whether the situation will further escalate next mainly depends on the scale of the US sanctions imposed on Russia and whether Russia will be provoked to take more aggressive measures.Peace and no war is in the biggest and common interests of all countries in the EU continent. In this sense, only by achieving a soft landing for the Russia-Ukraine crisis can EU realize peace. True security should be inalienable, common, integrated, cooperative and sustainable. This means all sides' security interests should be respected and safeguarded, and if any party's security concerns are ignored or even trampled on, geopolitical disputes will continue and never cease. The knot must be untied by the one who tied it. Russia and Ukraine need to have face-to-face dialogues. The US and NATO should be pulled back from the Russia-Ukraine crisis as much as possible and there should be no more complicated elements added to influence the situation.In particular, at a time when the situation is uncertain, all sides should leave some space for Russia and Ukraine to solve the problems. Confrontation, sanctions, or even a direct battle will not help ease tensions. The flames scattered in eastern Ukraine are reminding all parties of the fact that blindly imposing pressure will only lead to an escalation of conflicts. What is most needed there are restraints and rationality, as well as constructive efforts of the international community.   China has no self-interest in the Ukraine issue. It has always upheld a fair and responsible attitude and will decide its own position based on the merits of the matter itself. Although all parties have different views on the Ukraine crisis, the top priority now is to avoid any actions that could intensify tensions. The international community should reach such a consensus as soon as possible. The development of the Ukraine situation is the result of a series of complex factors. Now that it has come to the brink of a cliff, all parties should work together to pull it back.",OPINION,EDITORIAL,"United Nations Security Council meets after Russia recognized two breakaway regions in eastern Ukraine as independent entities, in New York City on Monday.

447,"EU agrees Russia sanctions package, warns of further action",Xinhua,2022-02-23," The EU (EU) is ready to take further action against Russia if it continues to escalate the crisis, EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen warned here on Tuesday.In a statement, von der Leyen said EU member states had given their political consent to a new package of sanctions against Russia following its recognition of the independence of the Ukraine regions of Donetsk and Luhansk.The package contains a number of ""calibrated measures"" targeting banks that finance the Russia military apparatus and contribute to the destabilization of Ukraine.It also bans trade between the two breakaway regions and the EU, as it did with Crimea in 2014, and limits the Russia government's ability to raise capital on the EU's financial markets.Russia President Vladimir Putin on Monday evening signed decrees recognizing the independence of two self-proclaimed regions in eastern Ukraine's Donbass as ""the Lugansk (LPR)"" and ""the Donetsk (DPR).""Russia has done everything to preserve the territorial integrity of Ukraine by fighting for the implementation of 2015 Minsk agreement, but all the efforts ended up in vain, Vladimir Putin said on Monday.The security crisis occurred due to NATO's eastward expansion, which has led to the loss of mutual trust with Russia, he noted.According to Josep Borrell, EU's High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, the package comprises sanctions against 351 members of the Russia State Duma (lower house of the country's Federal Assembly) who voted to recognize the two regions.The EU will also ""target 27 individuals and entities who are playing a role in undermining or threatening Ukraine's territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence,"" he said.Furthermore, the sanctions aim to target the Russia state's ability to access the EU's capital and financial markets and services.""If Russia continues to escalate this crisis that it has created, we are ready to take further action in response,"" von der Leyen said.On the controversial Russia-Germany Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, von der Leyen said she believed that the Germany government was ""absolutely right"" to stop the project, which must be assessed in light of the security of energy supply for all of EU.""This crisis shows that EU is still too dependent on Russia gas. We have to diversify our suppliers and massively invest in renewables. This is a strategic investment in our energy independence,"" she said.The conflict in eastern Ukraine began in April 2014 with fightings between the Ukraine government troops and local armed groups who seized several towns.With the mediation of the global community, the two sides in Belarus' capital of Minsk reached ceasefire agreements in September 2014 and February 2015 respectively.Russia has been seeking NATO's guarantee to halt eastward expansion. However, U.S. President Joe Biden's administration took a hard line against Russia, supporting Ukraine's efforts to join the U.S.-led military alliance and increasing its military assistance to Ukraine, which has re-escalated tensions in the region.The situation in eastern Ukraine has been getting worse since Feb. 17, as the Ukraine government and local armed groups blamed each other for launching aggressive bombards.",WORLD,EUROPE,"European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen makes a statement on the Ukraine issue in Brussels, Belgium, on Feb. 22, 2022.

451,"US hardly leads the West out of helplessness, but is in fact the cause",Zhao Minghao,2022-02-23,"The Munich Security Conference 2022 was held under the shadow of multiple challenges including the Ukraine crisis. The Munich Security Index 2022 shows perceptions of risk that pervade the societies of G7 countries due to COVID-19 pandemic, geopolitical tensions, domestic political polarization, and rising inequality. As the Munich Security Report 2022 points out, many West people believe that they are living in a ""new era of successive and interconnected disruptions,"" and there is a growing ""collective helplessness.""Such helplessness comes from domestic political dysfunction. Economic inequality, ethnic tensions, and intergenerational conflicts are old problems that become even worse in a polarized political environment. The stagnation of political reforms has largely contributed to ""crisis fatigue"" within the G7 countries mentioned in the Munich Security Report 2022. People feel less confident in their governments. According to a recent NBC News poll, only 22 percent answered that things are ""headed in the right direction.""The trend toward the retreat of democracy continues, warned Wolfgang Ischinger, chairman of the Munich Security Conference. The ""illiberal movement"" within the West is worsening, and there are challenges like populism and neo-fascism. US leadership in the West has been damaged due to its domestic illiberal movement. During the Joe Biden presidency, the US is more divided under the crisis of democracy. Helplessness stems from the external challenges West countries face, which are often self-imposed. NATO enlargement and the EU's expansion eastward are the key factors influencing Russia's strong responses to the Ukraine crisis, according to John Mearsheimer, professor at the University of Chicago. He pointed out that the Ukraine crisis is the West's fault as the West had been moving into Russia's backyard and threatening its core strategic interests. Indeed, Ukraine has the right to make a choice, but that choice should not expose its neighbor to a major security threat. Given the US and EU interference in Ukraine, it's hard to argue that Kiev's choice is truly ""independent."" Leaked classified documents show that senior US officials like Victoria Nuland, US' current under secretary of state for political affairs, have been weighing in on the make-up of the Ukraine government. For the US, the survival of NATO depends on deliberately created geopolitical tensions. The Obama administration's actions during the Russo-Georgian War and the Joe Biden administration's moves during the recent Ukraine crisis show to the world a rattled US government. ""Helpless"" EU must realize that there is indeed a geopolitical factor. Some EU countries, including Germany, seem to be interested in participating in the geopolitical game in the Indo-Pacific region, following US to provoke Beijing on the Taiwan question. This will bring them into trouble. Another contribution to the West's helplessness is the Afghanistan issue. With the hasty withdrawal of the US troops from Afghanistan, the humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan is getting worse because of the de facto US sanctions against the Taliban. The West does have a sense of frustration over Afghanistan, but it cannot be allowed to shrug off its responsibility in an immoral matter. The West is facing what former EU Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker called a ""polycrisis."" The US is hardly leading the West out of helplessness, and is in fact the cause. As the Munich Security Report 2022 emphasizes, collectively, they have the chance to turn the tide. Individually they risk being swept away. EU needs to make efforts to this end, especially to persuade US not to indulge in confrontations with China and Russia. The author is a senior fellow at the Charhar Institute and China Forum Expert at Tsinghua University. opinion@globaltimes.com.cn",OPINION,VIEWPOINT,"Outgoing Munich Security Conference Chairman Wolfgang Ischinger speaks at the end of the Munich Security Conference (MSC) in Munich, southern Germany, on February 20, 2022.

452,Can US’ balancing strategy last after Ukraine crisis?,Ding Gang,2022-02-23,"On February 21, 1972, US President Richard Nixon came to Beijing to begin a ""world-changing"" visit. He became the first sitting US president to visit China.On February 28, China and the US issued the Shanghai Joint Communiqué, which laid the foundation for the subsequent development of US-China relations.Twenty years ago, in February 2002, I interviewed Dr Kissinger in New York. Over the past two days, I have gone over my notes from that interview and have been filled with emotion.The China-US relationship seems to have gone through a strange circle, from breaking the ice in 1972, to steadily rising to a warm point in 2002, and then beginning to freeze again.The world is also in the midst of dramatic change. From Chairman Mao Zedong's handshake with President Nixon, to former President Donald Trump's ""decoupling"" with, to China-Russia back-to-back partnership today, and the outbreak of the Ukraine crisis, great powers are beginning to reorganize.I clearly remember Dr Kissinger telling me at the time that the breakthrough in the Shanghai Communiqué was largely due to a mutual recognition that establishing direct contacts was possible and in the interest of both sides.Kissinger said President Nixon made the goal of establishing diplomatic relations with China an integral part of his international strategy as soon as he took office. The China side had the same consideration.According to Kissinger, there were also concerns on the China side at the time about the threat from the Soviet Union. Those were the two bases on which the Shanghai Communiqué made its breakthrough. The basic spirit of the communiqué, in his view, was to establish a direct cooperative relationship between the US and China.The two foundations Dr Kissinger spoke of reflect his idea of a balanced strategy. The central idea of his book World Order was that a balance of power based on the Peace of Westphalia was the key to avoiding war and building peace.This idea of strategic balance still influences US's global strategy today, and the adjustment of US policy toward China clearly comes from this idea.In recent years, some in US have insisted that the US-China relationship is headed for a breakdown because China has adopted a more aggressive strategy of foreign expansion, undermining the order that the US has worked on for years to establish in the Asia-Pacific region and is upsetting the global balance of power.Some US scholars also cited Kissinger's advice before Nixon's visit to China 50 years ago.According to declassified documents, Kissinger told Nixon at the time that the US should ""play the balance of power game without any emotion.""Kissinger also predicted that in 20 years, China would be ""even more powerful"" and reminded the US president at that time to consider how to rely on Russia to keep China down.Such a balance of power game is to create a US-led structure to balance the relationship between global powers. Essentially it is not about trying to cooperate with the other side, but to ensure that the US can suppress and dismantle the other side in order to achieve US hegemony. Such a balancing structure will eventually force many small and medium-sized countries to choose sides. The crisis in Ukraine, which has gone so far, is a typical example.However, after China's peaceful rise, such a balancing strategy has become increasingly difficult to achieve. China and the US have become increasingly interdependent over the course of the past 50 years, and it is clear that their relationship is no longer tempered by equilibrium. Any forces that US would like to leverage to reorganize the so-called balance will hardly stop China's continued development.Fifty years ago, the US-China relationship made a breakthrough because of the US balancing strategy, and now, 50 years later, the relationship is beginning to ""decouple."" This is because, in US's balanced strategy, it has never seen itself as a party that can be on an equal footing with its so-called rivals, but always calculating how to prevent other countries from challenging its hegemonic position.The author is a senior editor with People's Daily, and currently a senior fellow with the Chongyang Institute for Financial Studies at Renmin University of China. dinggang@globaltimes.com.cn.

453,"All sides should give Russia, Ukraine some space to resolve issue: Global Times editorial",Global Times,2022-02-23,"Russia President Vladimir Putin on Monday signed two decrees recognizing ""the Lugansk (LPR)"" and ""the Donetsk (DPR)"" as independent and sovereign states. Ukraine decided to recall its charge d'affairs in Russia and will reconsider its diplomatic relations with Russia. The sudden change in the Ukraine situation has aroused great concern around the world. In this regard, China State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi said on Tuesday that the legitimate security concerns of any country must be respected, and the purposes and principles of the UN Charter must be upheld. He said China once again called on all parties to exercise restraint, appreciate the importance of implementing the principle of indivisible security, and de-escalate the situation and resolve differences through dialogue and negotiations.It should be noted that it is very regrettable that the Ukraine issue has evolved so far. The US has continued its intensive containment on Russia, which finally forced Russia to try to realize its security demands in such a way. This is the outburst of the dissatisfaction of the party whose security demands have been ignored for a long time since the end of the Cold War. The situation in Ukraine is deteriorating. At this time, the international community cannot discard its efforts for peace and to avoid further escalating the situation.The prospect of the situation between Russia and Ukraine remains highly uncertain. The US and West countries immediately condemned Russia's move. The White House officials said further ""coordinated"" sanctions directed at Russia would be announced on Tuesday. UN Secretary-General António Guterres said Russia's decision is ""a violation of the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Ukraine and inconsistent with the principles of the Charter of the UN."" He called for addressing ""all issues peacefully."" Many countries said they should not give up diplomatic means to peacefully solve the problem and underlined that ""constructive diplomacy is the need of the hour.""The Russia-Ukraine crisis is a dual crisis, in which bilateral conflicts between Russia and Ukraine are intertwined with the strategic suppression that NATO's eastward expansion has brought to Russia. All relevant parties have put forward their own security demands before. Although no consensus was reached, that doesn't necessarily mean a complete breakup of negotiations. It hasn't reached the point that the issue must be solved by war. Whether the situation will further escalate next mainly depends on the scale of the US sanctions imposed on Russia and whether Russia will be provoked to take more aggressive measures.Peace and no war is in the biggest and common interests of all countries in the EU continent. In this sense, only by achieving a soft landing for the Russia-Ukraine crisis can EU realize peace. True security should be inalienable, common, integrated, cooperative and sustainable. This means all sides' security interests should be respected and safeguarded, and if any party's security concerns are ignored or even trampled on, geopolitical disputes will continue and never cease. The knot must be untied by the one who tied it. Russia and Ukraine need to have face-to-face dialogues. The US and NATO should be pulled back from the Russia-Ukraine crisis as much as possible and there should be no more complicated elements added to influence the situation.In particular, at a time when the situation is uncertain, all sides should leave some space for Russia and Ukraine to solve the problems. Confrontation, sanctions, or even a direct battle will not help ease tensions. The flames scattered in eastern Ukraine are reminding all parties of the fact that blindly imposing pressure will only lead to an escalation of conflicts. What is most needed there are restraints and rationality, as well as constructive efforts of the international community.   China has no self-interest in the Ukraine issue. It has always upheld a fair and responsible attitude and will decide its own position based on the merits of the matter itself. Although all parties have different views on the Ukraine crisis, the top priority now is to avoid any actions that could intensify tensions. The international community should reach such a consensus as soon as possible. The development of the Ukraine situation is the result of a series of complex factors. Now that it has come to the brink of a cliff, all parties should work together to pull it back.",OPINION,EDITORIAL,"United Nations Security Council meets after Russia recognized two breakaway regions in eastern Ukraine as independent entities, in New York City on Monday.

457,"EU agrees Russia sanctions package, warns of further action",Xinhua,2022-02-23," The EU (EU) is ready to take further action against Russia if it continues to escalate the crisis, EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen warned here on Tuesday.In a statement, von der Leyen said EU member states had given their political consent to a new package of sanctions against Russia following its recognition of the independence of the Ukraine regions of Donetsk and Luhansk.The package contains a number of ""calibrated measures"" targeting banks that finance the Russia military apparatus and contribute to the destabilization of Ukraine.It also bans trade between the two breakaway regions and the EU, as it did with Crimea in 2014, and limits the Russia government's ability to raise capital on the EU's financial markets.Russia President Vladimir Putin on Monday evening signed decrees recognizing the independence of two self-proclaimed regions in eastern Ukraine's Donbass as ""the Lugansk (LPR)"" and ""the Donetsk (DPR).""Russia has done everything to preserve the territorial integrity of Ukraine by fighting for the implementation of 2015 Minsk agreement, but all the efforts ended up in vain, Vladimir Putin said on Monday.The security crisis occurred due to NATO's eastward expansion, which has led to the loss of mutual trust with Russia, he noted.According to Josep Borrell, EU's High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, the package comprises sanctions against 351 members of the Russia State Duma (lower house of the country's Federal Assembly) who voted to recognize the two regions.The EU will also ""target 27 individuals and entities who are playing a role in undermining or threatening Ukraine's territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence,"" he said.Furthermore, the sanctions aim to target the Russia state's ability to access the EU's capital and financial markets and services.""If Russia continues to escalate this crisis that it has created, we are ready to take further action in response,"" von der Leyen said.On the controversial Russia-Germany Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, von der Leyen said she believed that the Germany government was ""absolutely right"" to stop the project, which must be assessed in light of the security of energy supply for all of EU.""This crisis shows that EU is still too dependent on Russia gas. We have to diversify our suppliers and massively invest in renewables. This is a strategic investment in our energy independence,"" she said.The conflict in eastern Ukraine began in April 2014 with fightings between the Ukraine government troops and local armed groups who seized several towns.With the mediation of the global community, the two sides in Belarus' capital of Minsk reached ceasefire agreements in September 2014 and February 2015 respectively.Russia has been seeking NATO's guarantee to halt eastward expansion. However, U.S. President Joe Biden's administration took a hard line against Russia, supporting Ukraine's efforts to join the U.S.-led military alliance and increasing its military assistance to Ukraine, which has re-escalated tensions in the region.The situation in eastern Ukraine has been getting worse since Feb. 17, as the Ukraine government and local armed groups blamed each other for launching aggressive bombards.",WORLD,EUROPE,"European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen makes a statement on the Ukraine issue in Brussels, Belgium, on Feb. 22, 2022.

Ukraine refused to recognize their self-proclaimed status.Calling Russia's move ""the beginning of a Russia invasion of Ukraine,"" Joe Biden said in remarks delivered from the White House that his administration will impose sanctions on two Russia financial institutions - the VEB and the country's military bank -- as well as on Russia's sovereign debt and three individuals.He explained that the measure ""means we've cut off Russia's government from West financing.

461,"US hardly leads the West out of helplessness, but is in fact the cause",Zhao Minghao,2022-02-23,"The Munich Security Conference 2022 was held under the shadow of multiple challenges including the Ukraine crisis. The Munich Security Index 2022 shows perceptions of risk that pervade the societies of G7 countries due to COVID-19 pandemic, geopolitical tensions, domestic political polarization, and rising inequality. As the Munich Security Report 2022 points out, many West people believe that they are living in a ""new era of successive and interconnected disruptions,"" and there is a growing ""collective helplessness.""Such helplessness comes from domestic political dysfunction. Economic inequality, ethnic tensions, and intergenerational conflicts are old problems that become even worse in a polarized political environment. The stagnation of political reforms has largely contributed to ""crisis fatigue"" within the G7 countries mentioned in the Munich Security Report 2022. People feel less confident in their governments. According to a recent NBC News poll, only 22 percent answered that things are ""headed in the right direction.""The trend toward the retreat of democracy continues, warned Wolfgang Ischinger, chairman of the Munich Security Conference. The ""illiberal movement"" within the West is worsening, and there are challenges like populism and neo-fascism. US leadership in the West has been damaged due to its domestic illiberal movement. During the Joe Biden presidency, the US is more divided under the crisis of democracy. Helplessness stems from the external challenges West countries face, which are often self-imposed. NATO enlargement and the EU's expansion eastward are the key factors influencing Russia's strong responses to the Ukraine crisis, according to John Mearsheimer, professor at the University of Chicago. He pointed out that the Ukraine crisis is the West's fault as the West had been moving into Russia's backyard and threatening its core strategic interests. Indeed, Ukraine has the right to make a choice, but that choice should not expose its neighbor to a major security threat. Given the US and EU interference in Ukraine, it's hard to argue that Kiev's choice is truly ""independent."" Leaked classified documents show that senior US officials like Victoria Nuland, US' current under secretary of state for political affairs, have been weighing in on the make-up of the Ukraine government. For the US, the survival of NATO depends on deliberately created geopolitical tensions. The Obama administration's actions during the Russo-Georgian War and the Joe Biden administration's moves during the recent Ukraine crisis show to the world a rattled US government. ""Helpless"" EU must realize that there is indeed a geopolitical factor. Some EU countries, including Germany, seem to be interested in participating in the geopolitical game in the Indo-Pacific region, following US to provoke Beijing on the Taiwan question. This will bring them into trouble. Another contribution to the West's helplessness is the Afghanistan issue. With the hasty withdrawal of the US troops from Afghanistan, the humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan is getting worse because of the de facto US sanctions against the Taliban. The West does have a sense of frustration over Afghanistan, but it cannot be allowed to shrug off its responsibility in an immoral matter. The West is facing what former EU Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker called a ""polycrisis."" The US is hardly leading the West out of helplessness, and is in fact the cause. As the Munich Security Report 2022 emphasizes, collectively, they have the chance to turn the tide. Individually they risk being swept away. EU needs to make efforts to this end, especially to persuade US not to indulge in confrontations with China and Russia. The author is a senior fellow at the Charhar Institute and China Forum Expert at Tsinghua University. opinion@globaltimes.com.cn",OPINION,VIEWPOINT,"Outgoing Munich Security Conference Chairman Wolfgang Ischinger speaks at the end of the Munich Security Conference (MSC) in Munich, southern Germany, on February 20, 2022.

462,Can US’ balancing strategy last after Ukraine crisis?,Ding Gang,2022-02-23,"On February 21, 1972, US President Richard Nixon came to Beijing to begin a ""world-changing"" visit. He became the first sitting US president to visit China.On February 28, China and the US issued the Shanghai Joint Communiqué, which laid the foundation for the subsequent development of US-China relations.Twenty years ago, in February 2002, I interviewed Dr Kissinger in New York. Over the past two days, I have gone over my notes from that interview and have been filled with emotion.The China-US relationship seems to have gone through a strange circle, from breaking the ice in 1972, to steadily rising to a warm point in 2002, and then beginning to freeze again.The world is also in the midst of dramatic change. From Chairman Mao Zedong's handshake with President Nixon, to former President Donald Trump's ""decoupling"" with, to China-Russia back-to-back partnership today, and the outbreak of the Ukraine crisis, great powers are beginning to reorganize.I clearly remember Dr Kissinger telling me at the time that the breakthrough in the Shanghai Communiqué was largely due to a mutual recognition that establishing direct contacts was possible and in the interest of both sides.Kissinger said President Nixon made the goal of establishing diplomatic relations with China an integral part of his international strategy as soon as he took office. The China side had the same consideration.According to Kissinger, there were also concerns on the China side at the time about the threat from the Soviet Union. Those were the two bases on which the Shanghai Communiqué made its breakthrough. The basic spirit of the communiqué, in his view, was to establish a direct cooperative relationship between the US and China.The two foundations Dr Kissinger spoke of reflect his idea of a balanced strategy. The central idea of his book World Order was that a balance of power based on the Peace of Westphalia was the key to avoiding war and building peace.This idea of strategic balance still influences US's global strategy today, and the adjustment of US policy toward China clearly comes from this idea.In recent years, some in US have insisted that the US-China relationship is headed for a breakdown because China has adopted a more aggressive strategy of foreign expansion, undermining the order that the US has worked on for years to establish in the Asia-Pacific region and is upsetting the global balance of power.Some US scholars also cited Kissinger's advice before Nixon's visit to China 50 years ago.According to declassified documents, Kissinger told Nixon at the time that the US should ""play the balance of power game without any emotion.""Kissinger also predicted that in 20 years, China would be ""even more powerful"" and reminded the US president at that time to consider how to rely on Russia to keep China down.Such a balance of power game is to create a US-led structure to balance the relationship between global powers. Essentially it is not about trying to cooperate with the other side, but to ensure that the US can suppress and dismantle the other side in order to achieve US hegemony. Such a balancing structure will eventually force many small and medium-sized countries to choose sides. The crisis in Ukraine, which has gone so far, is a typical example.However, after China's peaceful rise, such a balancing strategy has become increasingly difficult to achieve. China and the US have become increasingly interdependent over the course of the past 50 years, and it is clear that their relationship is no longer tempered by equilibrium. Any forces that US would like to leverage to reorganize the so-called balance will hardly stop China's continued development.Fifty years ago, the US-China relationship made a breakthrough because of the US balancing strategy, and now, 50 years later, the relationship is beginning to ""decouple."" This is because, in US's balanced strategy, it has never seen itself as a party that can be on an equal footing with its so-called rivals, but always calculating how to prevent other countries from challenging its hegemonic position.The author is a senior editor with People's Daily, and currently a senior fellow with the Chongyang Institute for Financial Studies at Renmin University of China. dinggang@globaltimes.com.cn.

463,"All sides should give Russia, Ukraine some space to resolve issue: Global Times editorial",Global Times,2022-02-23,"Russia President Vladimir Putin on Monday signed two decrees recognizing ""the Lugansk (LPR)"" and ""the Donetsk (DPR)"" as independent and sovereign states. Ukraine decided to recall its charge d'affairs in Russia and will reconsider its diplomatic relations with Russia. The sudden change in the Ukraine situation has aroused great concern around the world. In this regard, China State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi said on Tuesday that the legitimate security concerns of any country must be respected, and the purposes and principles of the UN Charter must be upheld. He said China once again called on all parties to exercise restraint, appreciate the importance of implementing the principle of indivisible security, and de-escalate the situation and resolve differences through dialogue and negotiations.It should be noted that it is very regrettable that the Ukraine issue has evolved so far. The US has continued its intensive containment on Russia, which finally forced Russia to try to realize its security demands in such a way. This is the outburst of the dissatisfaction of the party whose security demands have been ignored for a long time since the end of the Cold War. The situation in Ukraine is deteriorating. At this time, the international community cannot discard its efforts for peace and to avoid further escalating the situation.The prospect of the situation between Russia and Ukraine remains highly uncertain. The US and West countries immediately condemned Russia's move. The White House officials said further ""coordinated"" sanctions directed at Russia would be announced on Tuesday. UN Secretary-General António Guterres said Russia's decision is ""a violation of the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Ukraine and inconsistent with the principles of the Charter of the UN."" He called for addressing ""all issues peacefully."" Many countries said they should not give up diplomatic means to peacefully solve the problem and underlined that ""constructive diplomacy is the need of the hour.""The Russia-Ukraine crisis is a dual crisis, in which bilateral conflicts between Russia and Ukraine are intertwined with the strategic suppression that NATO's eastward expansion has brought to Russia. All relevant parties have put forward their own security demands before. Although no consensus was reached, that doesn't necessarily mean a complete breakup of negotiations. It hasn't reached the point that the issue must be solved by war. Whether the situation will further escalate next mainly depends on the scale of the US sanctions imposed on Russia and whether Russia will be provoked to take more aggressive measures.Peace and no war is in the biggest and common interests of all countries in the EU continent. In this sense, only by achieving a soft landing for the Russia-Ukraine crisis can EU realize peace. True security should be inalienable, common, integrated, cooperative and sustainable. This means all sides' security interests should be respected and safeguarded, and if any party's security concerns are ignored or even trampled on, geopolitical disputes will continue and never cease. The knot must be untied by the one who tied it. Russia and Ukraine need to have face-to-face dialogues. The US and NATO should be pulled back from the Russia-Ukraine crisis as much as possible and there should be no more complicated elements added to influence the situation.In particular, at a time when the situation is uncertain, all sides should leave some space for Russia and Ukraine to solve the problems. Confrontation, sanctions, or even a direct battle will not help ease tensions. The flames scattered in eastern Ukraine are reminding all parties of the fact that blindly imposing pressure will only lead to an escalation of conflicts. What is most needed there are restraints and rationality, as well as constructive efforts of the international community.   China has no self-interest in the Ukraine issue. It has always upheld a fair and responsible attitude and will decide its own position based on the merits of the matter itself. Although all parties have different views on the Ukraine crisis, the top priority now is to avoid any actions that could intensify tensions. The international community should reach such a consensus as soon as possible. The development of the Ukraine situation is the result of a series of complex factors. Now that it has come to the brink of a cliff, all parties should work together to pull it back.",OPINION,EDITORIAL,"United Nations Security Council meets after Russia recognized two breakaway regions in eastern Ukraine as independent entities, in New York City on Monday.

467,"EU agrees Russia sanctions package, warns of further action",Xinhua,2022-02-23," The EU (EU) is ready to take further action against Russia if it continues to escalate the crisis, EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen warned here on Tuesday.In a statement, von der Leyen said EU member states had given their political consent to a new package of sanctions against Russia following its recognition of the independence of the Ukraine regions of Donetsk and Luhansk.The package contains a number of ""calibrated measures"" targeting banks that finance the Russia military apparatus and contribute to the destabilization of Ukraine.It also bans trade between the two breakaway regions and the EU, as it did with Crimea in 2014, and limits the Russia government's ability to raise capital on the EU's financial markets.Russia President Vladimir Putin on Monday evening signed decrees recognizing the independence of two self-proclaimed regions in eastern Ukraine's Donbass as ""the Lugansk (LPR)"" and ""the Donetsk (DPR).""Russia has done everything to preserve the territorial integrity of Ukraine by fighting for the implementation of 2015 Minsk agreement, but all the efforts ended up in vain, Vladimir Putin said on Monday.The security crisis occurred due to NATO's eastward expansion, which has led to the loss of mutual trust with Russia, he noted.According to Josep Borrell, EU's High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, the package comprises sanctions against 351 members of the Russia State Duma (lower house of the country's Federal Assembly) who voted to recognize the two regions.The EU will also ""target 27 individuals and entities who are playing a role in undermining or threatening Ukraine's territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence,"" he said.Furthermore, the sanctions aim to target the Russia state's ability to access the EU's capital and financial markets and services.""If Russia continues to escalate this crisis that it has created, we are ready to take further action in response,"" von der Leyen said.On the controversial Russia-Germany Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, von der Leyen said she believed that the Germany government was ""absolutely right"" to stop the project, which must be assessed in light of the security of energy supply for all of EU.""This crisis shows that EU is still too dependent on Russia gas. We have to diversify our suppliers and massively invest in renewables. This is a strategic investment in our energy independence,"" she said.The conflict in eastern Ukraine began in April 2014 with fightings between the Ukraine government troops and local armed groups who seized several towns.With the mediation of the global community, the two sides in Belarus' capital of Minsk reached ceasefire agreements in September 2014 and February 2015 respectively.Russia has been seeking NATO's guarantee to halt eastward expansion. However, U.S. President Joe Biden's administration took a hard line against Russia, supporting Ukraine's efforts to join the U.S.-led military alliance and increasing its military assistance to Ukraine, which has re-escalated tensions in the region.The situation in eastern Ukraine has been getting worse since Feb. 17, as the Ukraine government and local armed groups blamed each other for launching aggressive bombards.",WORLD,EUROPE,"European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen makes a statement on the Ukraine issue in Brussels, Belgium, on Feb. 22, 2022.

Ukraine refused to recognize their self-proclaimed status.Calling Russia's move ""the beginning of a Russia invasion of Ukraine,"" Joe Biden said in remarks delivered from the White House that his administration will impose sanctions on two Russia financial institutions - the VEB and the country's military bank -- as well as on Russia's sovereign debt and three individuals.He explained that the measure ""means we've cut off Russia's government from West financing.

471,"US hardly leads the West out of helplessness, but is in fact the cause",Zhao Minghao,2022-02-23,"The Munich Security Conference 2022 was held under the shadow of multiple challenges including the Ukraine crisis. The Munich Security Index 2022 shows perceptions of risk that pervade the societies of G7 countries due to COVID-19 pandemic, geopolitical tensions, domestic political polarization, and rising inequality. As the Munich Security Report 2022 points out, many West people believe that they are living in a ""new era of successive and interconnected disruptions,"" and there is a growing ""collective helplessness.""Such helplessness comes from domestic political dysfunction. Economic inequality, ethnic tensions, and intergenerational conflicts are old problems that become even worse in a polarized political environment. The stagnation of political reforms has largely contributed to ""crisis fatigue"" within the G7 countries mentioned in the Munich Security Report 2022. People feel less confident in their governments. According to a recent NBC News poll, only 22 percent answered that things are ""headed in the right direction.""The trend toward the retreat of democracy continues, warned Wolfgang Ischinger, chairman of the Munich Security Conference. The ""illiberal movement"" within the West is worsening, and there are challenges like populism and neo-fascism. US leadership in the West has been damaged due to its domestic illiberal movement. During the Joe Biden presidency, the US is more divided under the crisis of democracy. Helplessness stems from the external challenges West countries face, which are often self-imposed. NATO enlargement and the EU's expansion eastward are the key factors influencing Russia's strong responses to the Ukraine crisis, according to John Mearsheimer, professor at the University of Chicago. He pointed out that the Ukraine crisis is the West's fault as the West had been moving into Russia's backyard and threatening its core strategic interests. Indeed, Ukraine has the right to make a choice, but that choice should not expose its neighbor to a major security threat. Given the US and EU interference in Ukraine, it's hard to argue that Kiev's choice is truly ""independent."" Leaked classified documents show that senior US officials like Victoria Nuland, US' current under secretary of state for political affairs, have been weighing in on the make-up of the Ukraine government. For the US, the survival of NATO depends on deliberately created geopolitical tensions. The Obama administration's actions during the Russo-Georgian War and the Joe Biden administration's moves during the recent Ukraine crisis show to the world a rattled US government. ""Helpless"" EU must realize that there is indeed a geopolitical factor. Some EU countries, including Germany, seem to be interested in participating in the geopolitical game in the Indo-Pacific region, following US to provoke Beijing on the Taiwan question. This will bring them into trouble. Another contribution to the West's helplessness is the Afghanistan issue. With the hasty withdrawal of the US troops from Afghanistan, the humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan is getting worse because of the de facto US sanctions against the Taliban. The West does have a sense of frustration over Afghanistan, but it cannot be allowed to shrug off its responsibility in an immoral matter. The West is facing what former EU Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker called a ""polycrisis."" The US is hardly leading the West out of helplessness, and is in fact the cause. As the Munich Security Report 2022 emphasizes, collectively, they have the chance to turn the tide. Individually they risk being swept away. EU needs to make efforts to this end, especially to persuade US not to indulge in confrontations with China and Russia. The author is a senior fellow at the Charhar Institute and China Forum Expert at Tsinghua University. opinion@globaltimes.com.cn",OPINION,VIEWPOINT,"Outgoing Munich Security Conference Chairman Wolfgang Ischinger speaks at the end of the Munich Security Conference (MSC) in Munich, southern Germany, on February 20, 2022.

472,Can US’ balancing strategy last after Ukraine crisis?,Ding Gang,2022-02-23,"On February 21, 1972, US President Richard Nixon came to Beijing to begin a ""world-changing"" visit. He became the first sitting US president to visit China.On February 28, China and the US issued the Shanghai Joint Communiqué, which laid the foundation for the subsequent development of US-China relations.Twenty years ago, in February 2002, I interviewed Dr Kissinger in New York. Over the past two days, I have gone over my notes from that interview and have been filled with emotion.The China-US relationship seems to have gone through a strange circle, from breaking the ice in 1972, to steadily rising to a warm point in 2002, and then beginning to freeze again.The world is also in the midst of dramatic change. From Chairman Mao Zedong's handshake with President Nixon, to former President Donald Trump's ""decoupling"" with, to China-Russia back-to-back partnership today, and the outbreak of the Ukraine crisis, great powers are beginning to reorganize.I clearly remember Dr Kissinger telling me at the time that the breakthrough in the Shanghai Communiqué was largely due to a mutual recognition that establishing direct contacts was possible and in the interest of both sides.Kissinger said President Nixon made the goal of establishing diplomatic relations with China an integral part of his international strategy as soon as he took office. The China side had the same consideration.According to Kissinger, there were also concerns on the China side at the time about the threat from the Soviet Union. Those were the two bases on which the Shanghai Communiqué made its breakthrough. The basic spirit of the communiqué, in his view, was to establish a direct cooperative relationship between the US and China.The two foundations Dr Kissinger spoke of reflect his idea of a balanced strategy. The central idea of his book World Order was that a balance of power based on the Peace of Westphalia was the key to avoiding war and building peace.This idea of strategic balance still influences US's global strategy today, and the adjustment of US policy toward China clearly comes from this idea.In recent years, some in US have insisted that the US-China relationship is headed for a breakdown because China has adopted a more aggressive strategy of foreign expansion, undermining the order that the US has worked on for years to establish in the Asia-Pacific region and is upsetting the global balance of power.Some US scholars also cited Kissinger's advice before Nixon's visit to China 50 years ago.According to declassified documents, Kissinger told Nixon at the time that the US should ""play the balance of power game without any emotion.""Kissinger also predicted that in 20 years, China would be ""even more powerful"" and reminded the US president at that time to consider how to rely on Russia to keep China down.Such a balance of power game is to create a US-led structure to balance the relationship between global powers. Essentially it is not about trying to cooperate with the other side, but to ensure that the US can suppress and dismantle the other side in order to achieve US hegemony. Such a balancing structure will eventually force many small and medium-sized countries to choose sides. The crisis in Ukraine, which has gone so far, is a typical example.However, after China's peaceful rise, such a balancing strategy has become increasingly difficult to achieve. China and the US have become increasingly interdependent over the course of the past 50 years, and it is clear that their relationship is no longer tempered by equilibrium. Any forces that US would like to leverage to reorganize the so-called balance will hardly stop China's continued development.Fifty years ago, the US-China relationship made a breakthrough because of the US balancing strategy, and now, 50 years later, the relationship is beginning to ""decouple."" This is because, in US's balanced strategy, it has never seen itself as a party that can be on an equal footing with its so-called rivals, but always calculating how to prevent other countries from challenging its hegemonic position.The author is a senior editor with People's Daily, and currently a senior fellow with the Chongyang Institute for Financial Studies at Renmin University of China. dinggang@globaltimes.com.cn.

473,"All sides should give Russia, Ukraine some space to resolve issue: Global Times editorial",Global Times,2022-02-23,"Russia President Vladimir Putin on Monday signed two decrees recognizing ""the Lugansk (LPR)"" and ""the Donetsk (DPR)"" as independent and sovereign states. Ukraine decided to recall its charge d'affairs in Russia and will reconsider its diplomatic relations with Russia. The sudden change in the Ukraine situation has aroused great concern around the world. In this regard, China State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi said on Tuesday that the legitimate security concerns of any country must be respected, and the purposes and principles of the UN Charter must be upheld. He said China once again called on all parties to exercise restraint, appreciate the importance of implementing the principle of indivisible security, and de-escalate the situation and resolve differences through dialogue and negotiations.It should be noted that it is very regrettable that the Ukraine issue has evolved so far. The US has continued its intensive containment on Russia, which finally forced Russia to try to realize its security demands in such a way. This is the outburst of the dissatisfaction of the party whose security demands have been ignored for a long time since the end of the Cold War. The situation in Ukraine is deteriorating. At this time, the international community cannot discard its efforts for peace and to avoid further escalating the situation.The prospect of the situation between Russia and Ukraine remains highly uncertain. The US and West countries immediately condemned Russia's move. The White House officials said further ""coordinated"" sanctions directed at Russia would be announced on Tuesday. UN Secretary-General António Guterres said Russia's decision is ""a violation of the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Ukraine and inconsistent with the principles of the Charter of the UN."" He called for addressing ""all issues peacefully."" Many countries said they should not give up diplomatic means to peacefully solve the problem and underlined that ""constructive diplomacy is the need of the hour.""The Russia-Ukraine crisis is a dual crisis, in which bilateral conflicts between Russia and Ukraine are intertwined with the strategic suppression that NATO's eastward expansion has brought to Russia. All relevant parties have put forward their own security demands before. Although no consensus was reached, that doesn't necessarily mean a complete breakup of negotiations. It hasn't reached the point that the issue must be solved by war. Whether the situation will further escalate next mainly depends on the scale of the US sanctions imposed on Russia and whether Russia will be provoked to take more aggressive measures.Peace and no war is in the biggest and common interests of all countries in the EU continent. In this sense, only by achieving a soft landing for the Russia-Ukraine crisis can EU realize peace. True security should be inalienable, common, integrated, cooperative and sustainable. This means all sides' security interests should be respected and safeguarded, and if any party's security concerns are ignored or even trampled on, geopolitical disputes will continue and never cease. The knot must be untied by the one who tied it. Russia and Ukraine need to have face-to-face dialogues. The US and NATO should be pulled back from the Russia-Ukraine crisis as much as possible and there should be no more complicated elements added to influence the situation.In particular, at a time when the situation is uncertain, all sides should leave some space for Russia and Ukraine to solve the problems. Confrontation, sanctions, or even a direct battle will not help ease tensions. The flames scattered in eastern Ukraine are reminding all parties of the fact that blindly imposing pressure will only lead to an escalation of conflicts. What is most needed there are restraints and rationality, as well as constructive efforts of the international community.   China has no self-interest in the Ukraine issue. It has always upheld a fair and responsible attitude and will decide its own position based on the merits of the matter itself. Although all parties have different views on the Ukraine crisis, the top priority now is to avoid any actions that could intensify tensions. The international community should reach such a consensus as soon as possible. The development of the Ukraine situation is the result of a series of complex factors. Now that it has come to the brink of a cliff, all parties should work together to pull it back.",OPINION,EDITORIAL,"United Nations Security Council meets after Russia recognized two breakaway regions in eastern Ukraine as independent entities, in New York City on Monday.

477,"EU agrees Russia sanctions package, warns of further action",Xinhua,2022-02-23," The EU (EU) is ready to take further action against Russia if it continues to escalate the crisis, EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen warned here on Tuesday.In a statement, von der Leyen said EU member states had given their political consent to a new package of sanctions against Russia following its recognition of the independence of the Ukraine regions of Donetsk and Luhansk.The package contains a number of ""calibrated measures"" targeting banks that finance the Russia military apparatus and contribute to the destabilization of Ukraine.It also bans trade between the two breakaway regions and the EU, as it did with Crimea in 2014, and limits the Russia government's ability to raise capital on the EU's financial markets.Russia President Vladimir Putin on Monday evening signed decrees recognizing the independence of two self-proclaimed regions in eastern Ukraine's Donbass as ""the Lugansk (LPR)"" and ""the Donetsk (DPR).""Russia has done everything to preserve the territorial integrity of Ukraine by fighting for the implementation of 2015 Minsk agreement, but all the efforts ended up in vain, Vladimir Putin said on Monday.The security crisis occurred due to NATO's eastward expansion, which has led to the loss of mutual trust with Russia, he noted.According to Josep Borrell, EU's High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, the package comprises sanctions against 351 members of the Russia State Duma (lower house of the country's Federal Assembly) who voted to recognize the two regions.The EU will also ""target 27 individuals and entities who are playing a role in undermining or threatening Ukraine's territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence,"" he said.Furthermore, the sanctions aim to target the Russia state's ability to access the EU's capital and financial markets and services.""If Russia continues to escalate this crisis that it has created, we are ready to take further action in response,"" von der Leyen said.On the controversial Russia-Germany Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, von der Leyen said she believed that the Germany government was ""absolutely right"" to stop the project, which must be assessed in light of the security of energy supply for all of EU.""This crisis shows that EU is still too dependent on Russia gas. We have to diversify our suppliers and massively invest in renewables. This is a strategic investment in our energy independence,"" she said.The conflict in eastern Ukraine began in April 2014 with fightings between the Ukraine government troops and local armed groups who seized several towns.With the mediation of the global community, the two sides in Belarus' capital of Minsk reached ceasefire agreements in September 2014 and February 2015 respectively.Russia has been seeking NATO's guarantee to halt eastward expansion. However, U.S. President Joe Biden's administration took a hard line against Russia, supporting Ukraine's efforts to join the U.S.-led military alliance and increasing its military assistance to Ukraine, which has re-escalated tensions in the region.The situation in eastern Ukraine has been getting worse since Feb. 17, as the Ukraine government and local armed groups blamed each other for launching aggressive bombards.",WORLD,EUROPE,"European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen makes a statement on the Ukraine issue in Brussels, Belgium, on Feb. 22, 2022.

Ukraine refused to recognize their self-proclaimed status.Calling Russia's move ""the beginning of a Russia invasion of Ukraine,"" Joe Biden said in remarks delivered from the White House that his administration will impose sanctions on two Russia financial institutions - the VEB and the country's military bank -- as well as on Russia's sovereign debt and three individuals.He explained that the measure ""means we've cut off Russia's government from West financing. It can no longer raise money from the West and cannot trade in its new debt on our markets or EU markets either.""Joe Biden also mentioned the suspension of the Nord Stream 2 natural gas pipeline project between Russia and Germany, which Berlin announced earlier in the day.

481,"US hardly leads the West out of helplessness, but is in fact the cause",Zhao Minghao,2022-02-23,"The Munich Security Conference 2022 was held under the shadow of multiple challenges including the Ukraine crisis. The Munich Security Index 2022 shows perceptions of risk that pervade the societies of G7 countries due to COVID-19 pandemic, geopolitical tensions, domestic political polarization, and rising inequality. As the Munich Security Report 2022 points out, many West people believe that they are living in a ""new era of successive and interconnected disruptions,"" and there is a growing ""collective helplessness.""Such helplessness comes from domestic political dysfunction. Economic inequality, ethnic tensions, and intergenerational conflicts are old problems that become even worse in a polarized political environment. The stagnation of political reforms has largely contributed to ""crisis fatigue"" within the G7 countries mentioned in the Munich Security Report 2022. People feel less confident in their governments. According to a recent NBC News poll, only 22 percent answered that things are ""headed in the right direction.""The trend toward the retreat of democracy continues, warned Wolfgang Ischinger, chairman of the Munich Security Conference. The ""illiberal movement"" within the West is worsening, and there are challenges like populism and neo-fascism. US leadership in the West has been damaged due to its domestic illiberal movement. During the Joe Biden presidency, the US is more divided under the crisis of democracy. Helplessness stems from the external challenges West countries face, which are often self-imposed. NATO enlargement and the EU's expansion eastward are the key factors influencing Russia's strong responses to the Ukraine crisis, according to John Mearsheimer, professor at the University of Chicago. He pointed out that the Ukraine crisis is the West's fault as the West had been moving into Russia's backyard and threatening its core strategic interests. Indeed, Ukraine has the right to make a choice, but that choice should not expose its neighbor to a major security threat. Given the US and EU interference in Ukraine, it's hard to argue that Kiev's choice is truly ""independent."" Leaked classified documents show that senior US officials like Victoria Nuland, US' current under secretary of state for political affairs, have been weighing in on the make-up of the Ukraine government. For the US, the survival of NATO depends on deliberately created geopolitical tensions. The Obama administration's actions during the Russo-Georgian War and the Joe Biden administration's moves during the recent Ukraine crisis show to the world a rattled US government. ""Helpless"" EU must realize that there is indeed a geopolitical factor. Some EU countries, including Germany, seem to be interested in participating in the geopolitical game in the Indo-Pacific region, following US to provoke Beijing on the Taiwan question. This will bring them into trouble. Another contribution to the West's helplessness is the Afghanistan issue. With the hasty withdrawal of the US troops from Afghanistan, the humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan is getting worse because of the de facto US sanctions against the Taliban. The West does have a sense of frustration over Afghanistan, but it cannot be allowed to shrug off its responsibility in an immoral matter. The West is facing what former EU Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker called a ""polycrisis."" The US is hardly leading the West out of helplessness, and is in fact the cause. As the Munich Security Report 2022 emphasizes, collectively, they have the chance to turn the tide. Individually they risk being swept away. EU needs to make efforts to this end, especially to persuade US not to indulge in confrontations with China and Russia. The author is a senior fellow at the Charhar Institute and China Forum Expert at Tsinghua University. opinion@globaltimes.com.cn",OPINION,VIEWPOINT,"Outgoing Munich Security Conference Chairman Wolfgang Ischinger speaks at the end of the Munich Security Conference (MSC) in Munich, southern Germany, on February 20, 2022.

482,Can US’ balancing strategy last after Ukraine crisis?,Ding Gang,2022-02-23,"On February 21, 1972, US President Richard Nixon came to Beijing to begin a ""world-changing"" visit. He became the first sitting US president to visit China.On February 28, China and the US issued the Shanghai Joint Communiqué, which laid the foundation for the subsequent development of US-China relations.Twenty years ago, in February 2002, I interviewed Dr Kissinger in New York. Over the past two days, I have gone over my notes from that interview and have been filled with emotion.The China-US relationship seems to have gone through a strange circle, from breaking the ice in 1972, to steadily rising to a warm point in 2002, and then beginning to freeze again.The world is also in the midst of dramatic change. From Chairman Mao Zedong's handshake with President Nixon, to former President Donald Trump's ""decoupling"" with, to China-Russia back-to-back partnership today, and the outbreak of the Ukraine crisis, great powers are beginning to reorganize.I clearly remember Dr Kissinger telling me at the time that the breakthrough in the Shanghai Communiqué was largely due to a mutual recognition that establishing direct contacts was possible and in the interest of both sides.Kissinger said President Nixon made the goal of establishing diplomatic relations with China an integral part of his international strategy as soon as he took office. The China side had the same consideration.According to Kissinger, there were also concerns on the China side at the time about the threat from the Soviet Union. Those were the two bases on which the Shanghai Communiqué made its breakthrough. The basic spirit of the communiqué, in his view, was to establish a direct cooperative relationship between the US and China.The two foundations Dr Kissinger spoke of reflect his idea of a balanced strategy. The central idea of his book World Order was that a balance of power based on the Peace of Westphalia was the key to avoiding war and building peace.This idea of strategic balance still influences US's global strategy today, and the adjustment of US policy toward China clearly comes from this idea.In recent years, some in US have insisted that the US-China relationship is headed for a breakdown because China has adopted a more aggressive strategy of foreign expansion, undermining the order that the US has worked on for years to establish in the Asia-Pacific region and is upsetting the global balance of power.Some US scholars also cited Kissinger's advice before Nixon's visit to China 50 years ago.According to declassified documents, Kissinger told Nixon at the time that the US should ""play the balance of power game without any emotion.""Kissinger also predicted that in 20 years, China would be ""even more powerful"" and reminded the US president at that time to consider how to rely on Russia to keep China down.Such a balance of power game is to create a US-led structure to balance the relationship between global powers. Essentially it is not about trying to cooperate with the other side, but to ensure that the US can suppress and dismantle the other side in order to achieve US hegemony. Such a balancing structure will eventually force many small and medium-sized countries to choose sides. The crisis in Ukraine, which has gone so far, is a typical example.However, after China's peaceful rise, such a balancing strategy has become increasingly difficult to achieve. China and the US have become increasingly interdependent over the course of the past 50 years, and it is clear that their relationship is no longer tempered by equilibrium. Any forces that US would like to leverage to reorganize the so-called balance will hardly stop China's continued development.Fifty years ago, the US-China relationship made a breakthrough because of the US balancing strategy, and now, 50 years later, the relationship is beginning to ""decouple."" This is because, in US's balanced strategy, it has never seen itself as a party that can be on an equal footing with its so-called rivals, but always calculating how to prevent other countries from challenging its hegemonic position.The author is a senior editor with People's Daily, and currently a senior fellow with the Chongyang Institute for Financial Studies at Renmin University of China. dinggang@globaltimes.com.cn.

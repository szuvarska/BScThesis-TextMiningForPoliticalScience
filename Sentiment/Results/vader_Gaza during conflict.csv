VADER,The US' guarantee of Israeli impunity and lack of accountability has fostered a culture of war and excessive actions by Israel.,negative,2023-11-08
VADER,"This has led to strategic miscalculations, as Israel believed it could control millions of Palestinians without granting them rights or a state, which many consider to be an apartheid system. ",negative,2023-11-08
VADER,Israel's confidence in its actions stems from the assurance provided by the US.,positive,2023-11-08
VADER,So the second thing that needs to happen is for Israel to understand that there is a choice to be made and that there are costs for continuing to treat the Palestinians like this. ,positive,2023-11-08

0,US can no longer be perfunctory toward Guterres’ this appeal: Global Times editorial,Global Times,2022-08-22,"Since this year, the UN (UN) has repeatedly sounded the alarm on the global food crisis. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Saturday in Turkey once again underlined the unimpeded access to the global markets of Russia food and fertilizer; otherwise ""there may not be enough food in 2023."" This is a major appeal made by UN Secretary-General to the international community from the highest standpoint of safeguarding global common interests and preventing humanitarian crisis, which deserves positive response and strong support from all relevant countries.Guterres had clear target when he made these remarks. At present, it is no secret who is the biggest obstacle for Russia's fertilizers and agricultural products to enter the world market, and which segments they are mainly stuck in. Although the US and West countries have not included Russia agricultural products and fertilizers on their sanctions list, Guterres made it clear that the export of these products is still affected by a ""chilling effect."" The reality is true that most international traders are afraid of buying for fear of US and EU sanctions.On the other hand, even though the US and the West have lifted financial restrictions on Russia grain and fertilizers, etc., the issue of freight restrictions has remained unsettled. Russia ships are barred from entering key ports in regions such as the Mediterranean, while foreign ships are also banned from traveling to Russia ports to pick up food and other goods. That means even if one dares to buy them, these goods will either be difficult to ship or bear high shipping costs.The sanctions imposed by the US and the West against Russia have actually created a strong atmosphere of terror, and the normal and even just agricultural trade has been intensively disrupted and undermined. No matter how many high-sounding reasons the US and the West label on their sanctions, the bad consequences they have triggered are increasingly manifested. Apart from the food issue, many hegemonism and power politics practices that originate in US often eventually result in people's livelihood difficulties and even disasters in some developing countries. After all, it is the poor countries and the impoverished people who bear everything.In addition, on one side, it is the scene of people in poor countries starving, but on the other side, it is the feast of Wall Street and big grain merchants. The four companies known as the four ""largest grain traders"" control 75 to 90 percent of the world's grain trade, and three of them are US companies. According to US media reports, high food prices have made the wealth of US grain giants soar. Among them, three more members of the Cargill family joined the Bloomberg Billionaires list of the richest 500 people alive this year, while Bunge has raised its full-year profit forecast by over 20 percent this year. For the US, which has gained ill-gotten profits by provoking wars in other countries, food has also become a bargaining chip in its game of becoming rich overnight.In May, the UN Food Programme issued a warning that ""mankind may face the biggest food crisis after World War II"" and about 1.7 billion people will face hunger. As the negative factors such as COVID-19 continue to ferment, the current extreme drought in the northern hemisphere will cause a new blow to global food production. Compared with these uncontrollable natural disasters, opening a ""green channel"" for agricultural products and fertilizers exportations from Russia and Ukraine is obviously the cheapest and easiest to achieve and the effect will be instant. This is what many agricultural producing countries in Africa, Southeast Asia and South US are eagerly looking forward to.Guterres revealed that the UN was working with the US and the EU to overcome obstacles to Russia food and fertilizers reaching world markets. As UN secretary general, that's probably all he could say. But people know in their hearts that whether the world can avoid a food crisis next year largely depends on to what extent the US and EU could cooperate with the UN's overall coordination. The international community cannot pin the hope on the US and the West that they will enhance their awareness and take the initiative to change. It needs to continuously increase public opinion and moral pressure, and urge them to seriously perform their international obligations and responsibilities.Third world countries have long been criticizing that sanctions imposed by the US and the West on Russia have intensified the global food crisis, to which the US has made various excuses, claiming that it has ""no interest in weaponizing food to create humanitarian crises at the expense of vulnerable populations."" One month ago, the US hypocritically put on a show to buy Russia fertilizers. But since the UN secretary general still has to worry about the issue, which demonstrates that the problem has not been solved and also shows that the US lacks sincerity and executing capability. August COVID-19 marks the World Humanitarian Day, and Guterres also made a special appeal to rich countries in hope they can open their wallets and hearts to help those bearing the brunt of the global food crisis. Next, we will see what actual actions these countries will take. The international community has sharp eyes.",OPINION,EDITORIAL,United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres.

1,Healthy and stable China-S.Korea ties depend on addressing core concerns,Wang Junsheng,2022-08-23,"Wednesday marks the 30th anniversary of the establishment of China-South Korea diplomatic relations. Over the past 30 years, the two countries have gone through an extraordinary journey including regional political turbulence after the end of the Cold War, the international financial crisis in 2008, and crises on the Korean Peninsula. Now, given the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict, COVID-19 pandemic, regional turmoil and a sluggish global economy, the world has come to a complex and sensitive period. Facing this backdrop, China and South Korea, as two important countries, should take the anniversary as an opportunity to further strengthen their communication and cooperation. It is of great significance not only for the two countries, but also for the peace and development of the region and the world. Over the past 30 years, China and South Korea have improved ties simultaneously in the fields of politics, economy, culture and security. Politically, the two have established strategic partnership of cooperation as early as 2008. Economically, in 2021, bilateral trade exceeded $360 billion. Before COVID-19 pandemic, the two countries' people-to-people exchanges reached 10 million visits per year. In terms of security, the two have held high-level security dialogues. Few countries have such ties which have promoted cooperation across different fields at the same time. One key for the smooth development of the bilateral relationship has been mutual respect. China attaches great importance to its ties with South Korea. Even after the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic, Yang Jiechi, a member of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee and director of the Office of the Foreign Affairs Commission of the CPC Central Committee, and China State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi have paid three visits to South Korea in total, making South Korea the most frequently visited country by China high-level official during the pandemic. On March 10, 2022, President Xi Jinping sent a congratulatory message to Yoon Suk-yeol on his election as President of South Korea. On March 25, the two held a phone conversation. On May 9, China Vice President Wang Qishan led a delegation to South Korea to attend the inauguration ceremony of Yoon, making Wang the highest-rank China official to attend a South Korea president's inauguration and highlighting the continued high importance China attaches to the development of relations with South Korea. Another key for the rapid development of bilateral relations is the need for each side to accommodate the core concerns of the other. The two countries have different positions and face distinct pressing issues, making it normal for them to have respective considerations on related issues. During the 30 years since the establishment of diplomatic relations, there have been questions such as ""Should Seoul follow the US in interfering in China's internal affairs such as Taiwan question?"" and ""What kind of relationship will China develop with North Korea?"" Despite issue of THAAD deployment, both countries have generally taken consideration of each other's core concerns, which is the key to ensuring the healthy development and stability of bilateral ties. On the 30th anniversary of establishment of diplomatic ties, China and South Korea need to revisit their original intentions on bilateral relations, especially the relevant provisions in the Joint Communique on the Establishment of Diplomatic Relations between the Republic of Korea (ROK) and the China (PRC), which clearly states that ROK recognizes PRC as ""the sole legal government of China"" and said it ""respects the position of the China side that there is but one China in the world, Taiwan is part of China,"" and stipulates that China respects the desire of the Korean people for quick reunification through peaceful means and supports their efforts to reach that goal. As long as the two sides properly deal with third-party factors such as the US in accordance with the principles of the communique, bilateral political relations can maintain a healthy development. As the international status of both China and South Korea have risen, it's clear that the importance of the current bilateral ties has increased rather than declined, which has even long gone beyond simple bilateral relations, but has played a significant role in influencing the direction of regional and international issues. Looking ahead, both countries need to promote the stability and long-term future of the relationship and work together for the benefit of the people of both countries and the world, upholding the beneficial experience of the healthy and rapid development of bilateral relations.The author is a research fellow of East Asia studies at the China Academy of Social Sciences in Beijing. opinion@globaltimes.com.cn",OPINION,VIEWPOINT,Illustration: Chen Xia/GT,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'China': ('LOC', 9), 'South Korea': ('LOC', 10), 'Korean Peninsula': ('LOC', 1), 'Russia': ('LOC', 1), 'Ukraine': ('LOC', 1), 'Cold War': ('MISC', 1), 'COVID - 19': ('MISC', 3), 'Yang Jiechi': ('PER', 1), 'Wang Yi': ('PER', 2), 'Xi Jin': ('PER', 1), 'Yo': ('PER', 2), 'Su': ('PER', 1), 'Wang Qi': ('PER', 2), 'Political Bureau of': ('ORG', 1), 'Communist Party of China': ('ORG', 1), 'CPC': ('ORG', 1), 'Central Committee': ('ORG', 1), 'Office of the Foreign Affairs Commission': ('ORG', 1), 'CPC Central Committee': ('ORG', 2), 'Council': ('ORG', 1)}"
2,"China’s power in the world, economically and politically, a fact not going to change: former Corbyn adviser",Global Times,2022-08-23,"Editor's Note: For China people, the past decade has been epic and inspirational. The country, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping at the core, has made great endeavors in boosting its economy, deepening reforms, improving the rights of its people and acting as a responsible global power.After a ""golden era,"" China-UK relations have dimmed significantly over the past few years, as London has chosen to follow US's steps closely and regard Beijing's development as a ""threat"" to its interests instead of a reciprocal partner. Why do some UK politicians keep promoting a new cold war with China? Is there a misunderstanding in the UK about China's achievements? What could be the future of bilateral relations? Andrew Murray (Murray), a former communist, deputy president of London-based anti-war organization Stop the War Coalition, and former adviser to former Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn, shared his views on these issues with Global Times (Global Times) reporter Xia Wenxin.This is the 19th article of the Global Times series about this special decade.Global Times: You once claimed that ""a cold war with China is against the interests of the UK people."" Are there many people who hold this view in UK society today?Murray: I believe quite a number. There has been an intense propaganda campaign against China in recent years. But nevertheless, there are a number of people in business who are aware of the damage a new cold war would cause; in the higher education sector, people who are concerned about community relations and community cohesion; and people that want peace in international relations. I think there are a number of people who are aware that a cold war against China will not damage China so much as it will damage the interests of the UK people.I think it is important to emphasize that some people with the best intentions wished to oppose a cold war with China on the basis of a 100 percent defense of the China government and the China social system. Those are important issues to discuss, of course. But in my view, the argument against a cold war with China will be, making it clear, that this will damage the interests of UK businesses, workers employed in those businesses, the whole further and higher education sector, and the cultural sector. People may have very different views about the China government or the China social system, but that should not be a barrier to uniting them against a cold war.Global Times: Why is this view rejected by some UK politicians?Murray: Some UK politicians are simply swept along by the propaganda. I would think the main reason for the shift between the situation 10 years ago, when politicians were speaking of a ""golden age"" of China-UK relations, to the position today, is that most leading UK politicians follow US. There is now, unfortunately, a sort of bipartisan position of hostility to China in US. If you look at UK foreign policy over the last 70 years, it has been about, above all, following the US. I would say that is the main influence. Take Boris Johnson, now leaving as prime minister. He may have taken a more nuanced position toward China, but pressure from the US meant he had to fall into line with the anti-China campaign.Global Times: Both Tory leadership candidates, Elizabeth Truss and Rishi Sunak, have promised to take strong action against China after winning the election. In your opinion, will the future leader of the Conservative Party keep such a stance? Will the situation be different if the Labour Party comes to power?Murray: It depends on what the tough actions actually are, but I would expect that the same fact as I've just mentioned will continue to prevail. It seems Elizabeth Truss is most likely to win. She is already the foreign secretary, and she will continue to follow the US lead on this issue. I think that it's not realistic to hope for an improvement in China-UK relations in the near future.As for the Labour Party, it is hard to say so now. We had the previous Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn who would have been realistic to look for an improvement. But Keir Starmer (current Labour Party leader) and his foreign affairs folk actually have been very hostile to China since they took office two and a half years ago.In my view, there would not be a significant change. There might be some slight opportunities for amelioration. They might take a new look at some of the more challenging questions, but I wouldn't hold out great hope. As in the US, where Democrats and Republicans are not far apart on this question, I fear the same will be true here. The only factor that might make a difference is if there is a strong desire to confront Russia because of the war in Ukraine that might lead to a more pragmatic approach to China, simply to avoid having too many fights at one time.

Andrew Murray Photo: Courtesy of MurrayGT: You were a member of the Communist Party of Great UK and the Communist Party of UK. Is China's success under the leadership of the Communist Party of China (CPC) fully understood in UK society?Murray: Many of the CPC's enormous achievements are generally neglected in the narrative in UK society. I think that was based on a view that China would eventually become a sort of liberal, capitalist, bourgeois democracy. Now there is great anger that has not happened, and the CPC remains the leading force and develops plans for China society on a scientific basis. So, I think the role of the CPC is not well understood. Partly it is seen as if it was merely the same as the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in years gone by, despite the many differences and the historical experience between the two countries.Global Times: What has impressed you the most about China's achievements in the last decade? Do you have confidence in the future development of China?Murray: I've only visited China once, but it was just on a short visit, [I am impressed by] the enormous scale of the economic development in the course of this century. The vast extent of urban and industrial development is almost overwhelming to see.But what I personally think is important are the emphases that CPC has made in the last 10 years on trying to reduce social inequality, which had obviously widened considerably in the previous period of opening-up, and attempts to give stronger state's direction to the economy, not leave things simply to the market. Then, of course, the [China-proposed] Belt and Road Initiative has certainly represented the rise of China as a global economic power. I think those are the main features that have impressed me most.I'm sure China will definitely carry on developing in the foreseeable future. The economic growth will not perhaps be at the rate it was 20 years ago, but that is normal - you can't grow at a rate of 10-12 percent a year forever. But I'm confident that China will continue to develop.My hope is that its development will increasingly reveal the advantages of socialism. I hope having made this tremendous development will not let inequalities breed too far, or let private domination of the economy go beyond a certain limit. China does not seek to be a model for any other country. It says, we do what works for China, and other countries can learn as they please. But China increasingly reveals the advantages of socialist systems and societies.Global Times: How do you think China-UK ties will develop in the future? Is it possible to restart the ""golden era"" of bilateral relations?Murray: I don't think this will happen in the near future. Politically, there is a bipartisan negative view toward China. A great deal has been made around the recent episodes around the Taiwan island. And there is now a growing element in the UK ruling circles that sees China's development as a ""threat"" to UK's own positions in the world. So, if we look at the near future, I can't see any basis for expecting an improvement.Of course, the further ahead one looks, the more uncertain it becomes. China's power in the world, economically and politically, is now a fact that is not going to change. In the end, I believe the UK establishment will have to come to terms with that and learn to live with that, even though they will always be issues of difference, including the different nature of our two societies and different values. I think there could be an improvement, but I wouldn't expect that in the near term.Global Times: What changes are needed if London wants to repair its relations with Beijing?Murray: I think respect for internal affairs and respect for differences are essential. If those things are accepted, then when particular issues of difficulty come up, they can be resolved in a moment or an even amicable way.If we look at the issues that cause most controversy in relation to China, three of them - the position in Xinjiang with the Uygurs, the position in Hong Kong, and the position around Taiwan - are really internal affairs for the China. That must be respected, as we would expect China not to interfere in the matter of Scotland. Of course, one can have opinions on these things. One can even make criticisms if one wants. But they shouldn't interfere in state relations.The only issue that is a sort of international issue is the question of the boundaries in the China Sea, and that is a matter to be settled by the countries concerned and international organizations that should work to resolve those issues. So it's not really a direct concern of UK.",OPINION,VIEWPOINT,"Tower Bridge, London, the UK Photo:VCG",Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'China': ('LOC', 14), 'UK': ('LOC', 7), 'London': ('LOC', 2), 'US': ('LOC', 1), 'Beijing': ('LOC', 1), 'Communist Party of China': ('ORG', 1), 'CPC': ('ORG', 1), 'Central Committee': ('ORG', 1), 'Stop the War Coalition': ('ORG', 1), 'Labour Party': ('ORG', 1), 'Global Times': ('ORG', 4), 'Xi Jinping': ('PER', 1), 'Andrew Murray': ('PER', 3), 'Jeremy Corbyn': ('PER', 1), 'Xia Wenxin': ('PER', 1)}"
3,"Europe faces ‘coldest’ winter as energy crisis deepens, likely to prompt restructuring of global industrial chain",Qi Xijia,2022-08-23,"A deepening energy crisis in EU could put many economies on ice in the coming months, which may prompt a possible industrial restructuring, China analysts said on Tuesday.EU natural gas and electricity prices soared on Monday after Russia on Friday announced plans to shut off natural gas supplies to EU for three days, adding to concerns over a plunge in gas availability.Benchmark gas prices settled at a record high, while Germany power bills surged above 700 euros ($696) per megawatt-hour for the first time, Bloomberg reported.These developments come after Russia said it will stop its key Nord Stream gas pipeline for three days of equipment repairs on August 31, sparking concerns that it won't return to service after the work.The Nord Stream pipeline was already running at 20 percent of capacity, Reuters reported, stoking fears that Russia could halt gas supplies completely during the winter heating season and lead to an intensified energy crisis in EU. ""There is a good chance that Russia might cut off supplies to EU as a result of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, which could further exacerbate EU's energy crisis,"" Lin Boqiang, director of the China Center for Energy Economics Research at Xiamen University, told the Global Times on Tuesday.Although some EU countries are rushing to fill storage sites and diversify their sources of energy, such as by importing liquefied natural gas (LNG) from the US, such moves won't ease the crisis in the near future, Lin said.""If the EU wants to import lots of LNG from the US, it needs the corresponding infrastructure, which cannot be achieved shortly,"" Lin said.A major cause of the EU energy crisis is the sweeping economic sanctions launched by the US and its allies against Russia, experts said.While the US is self-sufficient in energy, it has dragged EU into a new cold war. EU is being forced to cut itself off from its main energy supplier and it is now suffering from soaring energy prices, Chen Jia, an independent research fellow on international strategy, told the Global Times on Tuesday.EU has lost about half of its zinc and aluminum smelting capacity within the past year, and a further surge in power prices could knock more plants offline during the coming winter, Bloomberg reported in July.It is feared that the situation will put EU energy-intensive industries under pressure, affect the commitment of EU to energy conservation and greenhouse gas emission reduction, and further aggravate divisions in EU society, Zhou Rong, a senior researcher at the Chongyang Institute for Financial Studies of Renmin University of China, told the Global Times on Tuesday.EU's aluminum smelters have cut output significantly and imports have surged since producers began cutting their output, raising EU consumers' carbon footprint by as much as 12 million tons per year, according to Bloomberg.As it is difficult to reverse the energy crisis in the EU, which is expected to deepen in the coming winter, some EU enterprises are considering a shift in some production capacity, and China is an ideal destination, Chen said.""China has the advantage of owning a complete global industry chain. If the top segment of the EU's industry chain decides to relocate to China, it will have China's full advantages of technology, manufacturing capacity and market as needed,"" Chen said.Amid the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, Germany companies have accelerated the pace of investment and factory establishment in China.In July, Germany chemical giant BASF gave final approval for the construction of the Zhanjiang Verbund site, according to an announcement on its official website. BASF will invest up to 10 billion euros by 2030 to build the new Verbund site, which will be BASF's third-largest Verbund site worldwide after Ludwigshafen, Germany, and Antwerp, Belgium, the announcement said.",SOURCE,ECONOMY,"A coal-fired power plant operated by German energy supplier RWE is seen in Neurath, western Germany, on July 13, 2022.

4,Severe drought in Europe ‘further expanding and worsening’: EU experts,AFP,2022-08-23,"A severe drought hitting swathes of EU is ""worsening"" and, while rain is helping some regions, accompanying thunderstorms are causing their own damage, EU researchers said in a report on Monday.The latest monthly analysis by the EU's Global Drought Observatory (GDO) highlighted the risk of ongoing soil dryness caused by successive heat waves since May and a ""persistent lack"" of rainfall.It maintained its warning issued with the previous report that nearly half of the EU's territory is at risk of drought, and noted that shriveling rivers and shrinking water sources are impacting energy generation at power plants and reducing crops.""The severe drought affecting many regions of EU since the beginning of the year has been further expanding and worsening as of early August,"" said the report.Increasing ""drought hazard"" was predicted for big chunks of Italy, Spain, Portugal, France, Germany, the Netherlands, ­Belgium, Ireland, Luxembourg, Romania and Hungary, as well as non-EU countries UK, Serbia, Ukraine and Moldova.In all, it calculated that 17 percent of EU was now in its red-alert category, higher than the 11 percent given in July.""Recent precipitation [in mid-August] may have alleviated drought conditions in some regions of EU. However, in some areas, associated thunderstorms caused damages, losses, and may have limited the beneficial effects of precipitation,"" it said.Mediterranean parts of the EU should expect ""warmer and drier than usual conditions"" up to November, it said.Regions hit with rain ""anomalies"" in the past three months included parts of Portugal, Spain, southern France, central Italy, Switzerland, southern Germany and much of Ukraine.The GDO report said that normal levels of rain were likely to now come to parts of EU between August and October but they ""may not be enough to fully recover from the deficit cumulated in more than half a year.""Parts of Spain, Portugal and Croatia may continue to suffer ""drier than normal weather conditions"" however, while dry conditions in the Alps were likely to ease.The report said that atmospheric conditions linked to the sort of heat waves baking EU were, over May, June and July, at their highest since 1950.",WORLD,EUROPE,Picture description not found,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'EU': ('ORG', 11), 'Global Drought Observatory': ('ORG', 1), 'GDO': ('ORG', 2), 'Italy': ('LOC', 2), 'Spain': ('LOC', 3), 'Portugal': ('LOC', 3), 'France': ('LOC', 2), 'Germany': ('LOC', 2), 'Netherlands': ('LOC', 1), 'Belgium': ('LOC', 1), 'Ireland': ('LOC', 1), 'Luxembourg': ('LOC', 1), 'Romania': ('LOC', 1), 'Hungary': ('LOC', 1), 'UK': ('LOC', 1), 'Serbia': ('LOC', 1), 'Ukraine': ('LOC', 2), 'Moldova': ('LOC', 1), 'Mediterranean': ('LOC', 1), 'Switzerland': ('LOC', 1), 'Croatia': ('LOC', 1), 'Alps': ('LOC', 1), 'non': ('MISC', 1)}"
5,"China issues urgent notice, vows all-out efforts to win battle of autumn harvest against drought, heat waves",Zhang Hui,2022-08-23," With China issuing the highest heat alert for 12 consecutive days on Tuesday, four China government departments including the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs (MOA) and Ministry of Water Resources jointly issued an urgent notice on reducing the impact of heat waves and drought on the country's autumn grain production. China is experiencing heat waves and dry weather with the longest duration, widest impact and largest average intensity since 1961, and the rapid development of drought combined with heat waves poses a severe threat to autumn grain production, according to a the notice published by the MOA on Tuesday. The involved regions should deeply understand the significance of reducing the impact of drought on the autumn grain harvest and on social and economic development, resolutely shoulder the political responsibility to guarantee national food security, and make all-out efforts to win the battle of the autumn grain harvest against drought and heat waves, the notice said.It said that water resources departments should strengthen the scientific management of rivers, lakes, reservoirs and other water resources to ensure the demand for agricultural irrigation water, and meteorological departments should promptly dispatch operational aircraft to severely drought-stricken areas and guide local governments in creating artificial rain. On Sunday, the MOA held a meeting on autumn grain output, saying that heat waves and drought have become the biggest threats affecting the autumn grain harvest in China, and dealing with the two factors to secure the autumn grain harvest was the primary task at present. China continued to issue the highest heat alert on Tuesday, with parts of Central China's Hunan Province, Southwest China's Sichuan Province and Chongqing, and China's Jiangxi Province experiencing temperatures as high as 40 C and above. Li Guoxiang, a research fellow at the China Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times on Tuesday that the heat-affected regions are the main rice production areas in China, and about 80-90 percent of China's rice seeding areas are in China. Globally, China is a major food producer and importer, and when food prices are still at high levels due to factors including the pandemic and the Russia-Ukraine conflict, ensuring China's grain harvest can not only reduce reliance on food imports, but could also contribute to stabilizing global food prices, Li said. Rice is the largest food crop in China, accounting for about 40 percent of autumn grain production. Autumn grain crops account for three-quarters of the annual grain output across China, China News Service reported. The impact of persistent drought on autumn grain production has sparked some worries on China's full-year grain output target in 2022 of 650 billion kilograms, but Li said that the drought will not affect the annual target, as the impact could be limited to a small scale with enough irrigation water. But this year's abnormal weather reminds China to establish a long-term mechanism, as extreme weather may occur more frequently in the future. In an interview with the Global Times in July, Lorenzo Labrador, scientific officer at the World Meteorological Organization's Global Atmosphere Watch Programme, said that he expected above-average temperatures all over the globe to become a trend. ""The reason is that, whereas heat waves are a normal atmospheric phenomenon, the increasing concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere that cause the atmosphere to retain more heat makes heat waves more likely and its temperatures more severe. We have been seeing this trend for a number of years now and it is likely to continue"". Wei Ke, associate research fellow at the Institute of Atmospheric Physics of the China Academy of Sciences, told the Global Times on Tuesday that he believed 2022 was the third year of a new era for the climate crisis, and human beings will embrace the fourth, fifth and more years of this era, with global warming pacing forward. According to him, 2020 was the first year of this new era, as the world from the US to Australia was hit by wildfire, and locust swarms plagued East Africa, West and South Asia. Wei said that future extreme disasters will come more frequently, and what's worse, they may come together, such as drought, flood and wildfire. ""In the future, we may face a combination of several disasters at a time. The influence could be much more severe,"" Wei said. Abnormal weather will also be more severe and frequent, according to Li. He said North China was more frequently hit by drought and China by flood in the past, but this year it is the opposite. Thus, both southern and northern China should prepare water resources facilities that can deal with both flood and drought, and also develop new types of crops to adapt. Wei said that regarding the possibility of combined disasters, China should prepare an early warning system that could issue warnings one or two months in advance.",CHINA,SOCIETY,"Battling intense drought and heat waves, local meteorological staffers in Huai'an, East China's Jiangsu Province, carry out rainmaking operations to increase precipitation across six spots in the city.

6,Taiwan policy shift in Washington is born out of desperation: former US Marine,Global Times,2022-08-22,"Editor's Note: The US is out of time. China's economic and military rise means that as each year goes by the US is less and less able to hold any sort of advantage over China should it provoke a conflict either directly or by proxy, said Brian Berletic (Berletic), a geopolitical analyst and a former solider of US Marine Corps. He argued that the US in fact is using Taiwan island as a proxy against the rest of China to exhaust it politically, economically, and militarily. Global Times (Global Times) reporters Yu Jincui and Bai Yunyi interviewed Berletic via email. Global Times: In your opinion, how has Pelosi's visit to Taiwan influenced the Taiwan Straits situation and China-US relations? Has the Taiwan Straits entered into a new status quo? Berletic: Rather than influencing the Taiwan Straits situation and China-US relations, I believe it is a symptom of both. The trip on US's part was a continuation of an incremental erosion of its own bilateral agreements made with Beijing regarding the One China policy, as well as the continuation of US's violations of international law regarding national sovereignty, political independence, and territorial integrity. I do however believe we have entered into a new status quo based on China's reaction to this most recent provocation coupled together with demonstrated China military strength that appears to have shocked many US.Global Times: How do you predict the situation in the Taiwan Straits in the next five years? Berletic: The US, for decades, has pursued an encirclement and containment policy toward China. Taiwan island has always been a central part of that policy. Whatever agreements the US made over the years were agreements clearly made in bad faith and the US will most certainly continue ""hollowing out"" the One China policy. How this will change over the next five years will be China's growing ability to stop and even reverse this process through its tremendous and ever-growing economic and military power. I think we will see this economic and military power translate into an incremental reversal of US efforts to create a growing crisis regarding Taiwan. Global Times: You once served in the Marine Corps. In your opinion, does the US have the ability to defend Taiwan? Berletic: China, even according to many US analysts, possesses powerful anti-access area denial (A2AD) capabilities. This would make it very difficult for the US to send military forces into or around Taiwan during a China military operation. This is why some US analysts have suggested the US incrementally expand the US military presence on Taiwan which is an escalation I would not be surprised to see the US commit to in the near future. The US lacks the ability to penetrate China A2AD capabilities without suffering severe costs in men and equipment. In addition to this, sustaining combat operations against China off their own coast and thousands of miles away from US shores would be incredibly difficult. A China military operation fully committed to success at any cost would present the US with a conflict it is unlikely to win. But this assumes the US actually seeks to ""defend"" Taiwan. If US's actual goal is to use Taiwan as a proxy to divide China politically, undermine it economically, and overextend it militarily, then ""success"" would be triggering a conflict in the first place, which is what it appears the US is actually most likely trying to do. Global Times: Some argue that the US wants to use Taiwan as a ""porcupine"" and is ready to fight to the last drop of Taiwan people's blood to weaken China just as what it did with Ukrainians. How do you view such an opinion? Does the US have such intent? Berletic: This is actually the most likely scenario - using Taiwan as a proxy against the rest of China to exhaust it politically, economically, and militarily. The US is indeed conducting a similar proxy conflict against Russia through Ukraine. Many aspects of US interference in regards to Taiwan including political and military support, mirror what preceded the conflict now raging in Ukraine. The US deliberately picked a red line to Russia in regards to Ukraine and is now doing the same to China in regards to Taiwan. The US demonstrably doesn't care about Taiwan's future in any sense and has already begun preparing itself in terms of semiconductor production for a disruption in Taiwan US itself is attempting to create. The US will do everything in its power to realize this provocation by crossing red lines for China it knows cannot be ignored. Global Times: Is there a trend that US is shifting from strategic ambiguity toward Taiwan to strategic clarity? Is this an adventurous move? Berletic: The shift in US is one born out of desperation rather than adventurism. The US is out of time. China's economic and military rise means that as each year goes by the US is less and less able to hold any sort of advantage over China should it provoke a conflict either directly or by proxy. It is difficult to imagine the Pentagon applying the brakes to a scenario that will undoubtedly at the very least enrich US arms manufacturers, many of whom hold tremendous influence over the Pentagon's leadership through the revolving door relationship best embodied by former general, then Raytheon board member and now Secretary of Defense Llyod Austin. Global Times: As a former soldier, what do you think of the probability of direct war between major powers (China, the US, and Russia) in the future? Or will proxy wars be the primary pattern of wars in the world in the future? Berletic: This is very difficult to predict. As the US declines as a global hegemon a certain sense of desperation has clearly taken hold. The interests driving US foreign policy will never voluntarily concede US's primacy on the global stage which means that while US would prefer waging a proxy war to preserve its global standings, if they are unsuccessful, they may decide it is worth it to commit to a direct confrontation they would attempt to keep from going ""nuclear."" US military planners like those at the RAND Corporation have written entire papers discussing a war between the US and China they believe would remain conventional and would ultimately see the US as the primary beneficiary. This thinking is deeply disturbing, but it is thinking taking place at the highest levels in the West nonetheless. Global Times: From the perspective of US power projection in the world, is US withdrawing from the Middle East and EU and putting more military resources and power into China's periphery? Is the US seeking to establish a de factor Asia version of NATO?Berletic: US has reconfigured its presence in the Middle East and EU from attempting to impose itself upon both regions, to dividing and destabilizing them. Both regions saw an opportunity to expel US interference and unite in peaceful prosperity with US's adversaries - namely China and Russia. In fact, EU's relationship with Russia was vastly improving before February of this year with the conflict provoked in Ukraine designed specifically to derail this growing cooperation, divide and weaken EU, and subordinate it to US interests once again. A similar process is taking place across the Middle East as well as in Asia. The idea of the US creating an ""Asia NATO"" is very appealing to US policymakers. However, the entire region prefers to cooperate with China leaving the US to assemble alliances with nations not even located in Asia - AUKUS for example. Just like in EU, the US is attempting to destabilize Asia, move into power irrationally anti-China governments, and create the same sort of division, conflict, and hostility seen in EU right now. It will be up to China, Russia, and the majority around the world to collectively condemn and work against this destructive agenda.",OPINION,VIEWPOINT,"The air force and naval aviation corps of the Eastern Theater Command of the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) fly warplanes to conduct operations around the Taiwan Island, Aug 4, 2022.

Algerian singer Amazigh Kateb performs at the Roman theater of Carthage on August 5, 2022. Photo: Agence France-Presse For the past five weeks, thousands of people flocked to the Roman theater of Carthage in the capital Tunis, waiting patiently for the show to start. The return of Tunisia's 56th International Festival of Carthage (FIC) has brought people an unforgettable time of joy in hard times.""Following a two-year hiatus due to the pandemic, we have noticed a remarkable presence of the audience. We're glad to see so many people thirsty for a return to normal life through art,"" Kamel Ferjani, the 56th FIC artistic director, told the Xinhua News Agency on Friday.The FIC has been a well-known musical event held in the North Africa country since 1964. It takes place in July and August every year, with all shows performed in the Roman theater of Carthage, a restored ancient theater located on the outskirts of the capital Tunis.For 2022, a selection of 33 shows was held from July 14 to August 20, and Tunisia took the lion's share with 15 shows, in addition to 18 shows from Egypt, Lebanon, South Korea, Switzerland, and many other countries.""We tried to ensure that all artistic styles are represented and of a high quality that appeals to all age groups, particularly young people,"" Ferjani said, adding that nearly half of the performances were new ones making their debut during the festival.Ferjani said they have worked against all odds to make the festival a success. ""We had to prepare under extremely difficult conditions, particularly during the sixth wave of COVID-19 that hit the country in January and February.""Mariam Ben Moulehom, a 21-year-old dental student, has been to the festival four times over the past month.""I watched the opening ceremony, the concert of Saber al Rebai, who is dubbed the prince of Arabic song, enjoyed Leila Toubel's play Taqouta on the occasion of Tunisian Women's Day and the most famous Sufi performance in Tunisia the El Hadhra,"" Moulehom enthusiastically listed the shows she had seen.""Every Tunisian enjoys the International Festival of Carthage, one of the most important music festivals in the Arab world. It provides US an excellent opportunity to see a variety of national and international performances,"" she told Xinhua. Saber Kammoun, a fish trader in his 50s, traveled nearly 270 kilometers with his family from their home in Sfax Province to the capital to attend the festival for the first time.""I love the relaxing atmosphere of the festival,"" he said.The festival provided Tunisians with more than just beautiful melodies and shimmering costumes; for many, it served as a respite from the economic challenges their nation is currently experiencing.Tunisia's economy has faced hurdles in recent years. Its economic problems, which had existed since 2011, were aggravated after the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic in 2020.In 2022, a stronger US dollar led by the Federal Reserve's rate hikes raised the cost of imports. As a net importer of food and energy, Tunisia's inflation, which has already been exacerbated by the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, continued to rise.In July, Tunisia's inflation rose to 8.2 percent, the highest record since October 1991.""I enjoyed the festival, because it is an opportunity for me to reduce the stress of daily life,"" Kammoun said, hoping he could come again in 2023.",ARTS,MUSIC,"Algerian singer Nedjim Bouizzoul performs at the Roman theater of Carthage during the 56th edition of the International Festival of Carthage on August 5, 2022.

9,"Concerns over escalating tensions in Asia-Pacific intensified as US, S.Korea to begin biggest military drills in years",Xu Keyue,2022-08-21,"As US is seeking to bolster strategic ties with one of its closest Asia allies, the US and South Korea will begin their biggest combined military exercise in four years from Monday as tensions in the Korean Peninsula escalate. China observers warned the exercise would raise tensions in the peninsula and wider Asia, and regional countries including China would be on high alert. The allies' summertime drills - Ulchi Freedom Shield (UFS) - which is nominally defensive as it has been annually staged, will take place from Monday to September 1 in South Korea, AP reported.The report noted that the drills will underscore US and Seoul's commitment to restore large-scale training exercises after they canceled some of their regular drills and downsized others to computer simulations in recent years to create space for diplomacy with North Korea and because of COVID-19 concerns.According to media reports, the drills will involve tens of thousands of troops in live-fire exercises combining land, sea and air forces. The maneuvers are set to include joint mock attacks, reinforcement of frontline units and simulations involving the securing of weapons of mass destruction.Units will also practice using drones for surveillance and a number of new developments in warfare that have emerged amid the Russia-Ukraine conflict, a South Korea Defense Ministry official told reporters in Seoul.North Korea has denounced the exercise as a dress rehearsal for northward invasion, the Xinhua News Agency reported on August 16. As China-US ties have become more confrontational, especially after US house speaker Nancy Pelosi paid a provocative visit to the island of Taiwan on August 2 despite China's strong opposition, this joint military exercise led by the US has more meanings and purpose - not only aimed at North Korea, but also to flex the US' muscle in the Asia-Pacific region and to demonstrate its military presence in the region and to deter China, Lü Chao, an expert on the Korean Peninsula issue at the Liaoning Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times on Sunday.During the drills, the US is likely to deploy more strategic weapons, such as aircraft carriers and strategic bombers, Lü predicted, noting that China needs to be vigilant on this amid mounting tensions in the Taiwan Straits.The military drills would escalate tensions in the Korean Peninsula, which have always been regarded as a ""powder keg"" in the Asia-Pacific region, and the development of the situation in the peninsula would affect the peace and stability of Northeast Asia and even all of Asia, Lü warned.If chaos breaks out on the Korean Peninsula, it will also pose a threat to China's national security. China will not sit idly by, Song Zhongping, a China military expert and TV commentator, told the Global Times.Also, the drills will inevitably attract the attention of Japan, and the possibility that Japan will be involved in the military exercises between the US and South Korea in the future could not be ruled out, Song said. The US is making efforts in building a trilateral military alliance, the military expert warned.The US Department of Defense said the US, South Korea and Japan navies took part in missile warning and ballistic missile search and tracking exercises off the coast of Hawaii from August 8 to 14, which it said was aimed at furthering trilateral cooperation ""in face of North Korean challenges,"" according to the AP report on August 16.Observers pointed out that Seoul is in a contradictory state. On the one hand, the South Korea-US military exercises are led by the US military and have to be carried out, and South Korea also makes a gesture of full cooperation in the drills. On the other hand, both the authorities and the people in South Korea are deeply concerned about a situation that could lead to an escalation of tensions on the Korean Peninsula.In protest against the planned South Korea-US war games, thousands of liberal activists gathered in central Seoul on August 13 in advance of the Liberation Day on August 15 to celebrate the 77th anniversary of the Korean Peninsula's liberation from the Imperial Japan's 1910-45 colonial rule, Xinhua reported.The administration of South Korea President Yoon Suk-yeol has been making efforts to strike a balance between the major powers, but the overall trend of its diplomacy appears to be further enhancing the South Korea-US alliance, some observers said.Tying itself to the US' Indo-Pacific Strategy is clearly not in line with the realistic interests of South Korea, despite US ramping up its coercive efforts to push the country to ""take sides"" and trying to expand NATO to the Asia region, experts noted.",CHINA,MILITARY,"Some tanks park in Paju, South Korea, on August 21, 2022, one day before the US and South Korea are scheduled to begin the Ulchi Freedom Shield drills from August 22 to September 1 in South Korea.

11,Berlin warned against joining anti-China alliance at its own expense,Chen Qingqing,2022-08-21,"Some major Germany media outlets have voiced concern over the Germany Air Force participating in Exercise Pitch Black for the first time. They warned that Berlin is joining an anti-China alliance in the Indo-Pacific, which in the long term will affect its trade relations with Beijing. China experts consider such rational voices as a reflection of the mainstream attitude toward China that representatives from business and political sectors shared in Germany. However, while Germany's Chancellor Olaf Scholz cautiously strikes a balance between major powers, the increasing military presence of Germany in the Indo-Pacific showed the divergences inside the Germany government, sending out a ""chaotic signal"" on its China policy, some experts said. They also believe that such ambiguity reflects Berlin's struggles in coming up with a balanced adjustment in its relations with Beijing as the Germany government has to take more factors into account, including the Ukraine crisis, China's relations with Russia and tensions in the Taiwan Straits. Exercise Pitch Black, a military drill involving the US, Australia and 15 other countries, reportedly started on Friday with the US' purpose being to pull more countries into an anti-China united frontline and show the ""unity"" of the West to pressure China over the Taiwan question.With its first large presence, the Germany Air Force (Luftwaffe) wants to demonstrate its strength against China in the Indo-Pacific, Germany national daily newspaper Die Welt said in an article recently, saying that this is honorable but Germany is not  US, and a ""thumbling should not think himself as a giant."" Another Germany media outlet, the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, said in a recent article that the Luftwaffe's excursion to the Indo-Pacific signals Germany's readiness for military engagement in probably the most important region of the world, geopolitically, but the newspaper also warned that ""Germany is too weak militarily."" Germany is sending 13 military aircraft to join the exercises in Australia, with six Eurofighters, three A330 tankers and four A400M transporters taking off from Germany. Germany air force chief Ingo Gerhartz was quoted as saying in media reports that the jets will ""barely touch"" the China Sea and will not pass through the Taiwan Straits.It is not necessary for Germany to hype the China Sea or the Taiwan question if it is just a routine military exercise, Cui Hongjian, director of the Department of EU Studies at the China Institute of International Studies, told the Global Times on Sunday.""We appear to take any military actions related to the US surrounding China now as moves targeting US. If Germany and China don't communicate well on the matter, it will increase risks of miscalculation,"" Cui warned. Some China experts believe that Germany's policy toward China, especially under the Scholz administration, has continued the tradition of the Merkel era, and has been adjusting and redefining the policy at the same time with differences in rhetoric adopted by the Germany chancellery, foreign ministry and the Bundeswehr, a catch-all term in Germany, incorporating the army, navy and air force.""Even if Germany leans toward the US on some China-related matters, I believe it would be just symbolic,"" Jiang Feng, a research fellow at Shanghai International Studies University, told the Global Times on Sunday. As now the US takes the rise of China as the biggest ""threat,"" voices in EU are echoing the claims. For example, Germany foreign minister Annalena Baerbock also cited China as a ""threat,"" Jiang said. But Germany understands clearly that it is crucially important to maintain China as a strategic partner for Germany's strategic and economic interests, so Berlin's China policy will be fundamentally different from that of US, Jiang noted.The Germany economy became more dependent on China in the first half of 2022, with direct investment and its trade deficit reaching new heights, despite political pressure on Berlin to pivot away from Beijing, Reuters reported on Friday, citing a study from the Germany Economic Institute. Still, the Germany air force tried to play down the connection between the military exercise with US strategy of containing China in the region, as Gerhartz was quoted as saying in the media reports that ""I don't think we are sending any threatening message toward China by flying to an exercise in Australia."" ""From the later stage of the Merkel administration, there have been contradictions between the Germany military and the government, forming a chaotic signal. If Germany intentionally emphasizes its presence from now on in the Indo-Pacific region, it may lead the country to an unbalanced status,"" Cui said. The Germany Navy frigate Bayern crossed the China Sea in December 2021 with the hype of West media outlets, emphasizing that this was the first time a Germany warship has entered the China Sea in the past 20 years.""Against the backdrop of the Ukraine crisis, when Germany adjusts its policy toward China, it has to consider more factors such as China-Russia relations, EU-Russia relations and China's relations with its neighboring countries. Previously, it only took China-US relations into account,"" Cui said. Germany is reviewing its strategy on China and will make the new posture public sometime in 2023, according to earlier media reports. Some experts also believe that compared to its relations with China previously established on trade and economic ties, future Germany-China relations will underscore some security concerns, seeking a new balance in a changing geopolitical landscape.",CHINA,DIPLOMACY,China-German Photo: VCG,"Reporter, Beijing","Chen Qingqing co-leads the Global Times China desk.

12,Wang Yi's attendance of follow-up meeting of FOCAC signals steady progress of ties,Zhang Han,2022-08-18," China  on Thursday held virtual discussions with Africa leaders in the 8th Ministerial Conference of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC) against the backdrop of a complex and volatile international environment and the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. China-Africa cooperation is based on concrete measures and projects, yielding tangible benefits, and the strong partnership is common interest-oriented and won't be shaken by US attempts to sow discord, analysts said. Wang put out three consensus achieved during the meeting: all participants are committed to promoting the building of a China-Africa community with a shared future in the new era, to strengthening solidarity and cooperation among developing countries, and to continuing to Poland the ""golden brand"" of FOCAC.While announcing Wang Yi's attendance at the Thursday meeting, China Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said at a Wednesday routine press briefing that both China and Africa find it necessary to hold the coordinators' meeting to strengthen coordination and planning, match their approaches to cooperation, identify priority areas and key projects and make steady and solid progress in the follow-up work so as to deliver more benefits to the two peoples. China will continue to follow the principles of sincerity, real results, amity and good faith and the principle of pursuing the greater good and shared interests, and work with the Africa side to inject new impetus into the growth of the China-Africa comprehensive strategic and cooperative partnership, Wang Wenbin said.The coordinators' meeting is part of the FOCAC mechanism to check on follow-up work, but the attendance of a state councilor and foreign minister is uncommon, ""signaling the great importance China attaches to its relations and cooperation with Africa,"" Liu Haifang, director of the Center for Africa Studies at Peking University, told the Global Times on Thursday. The FOCAC is not just a forum, but also includes a large amount of coordination and communication through various meetings and channels, which guarantees that bilateral cooperation will advance steadily and robustly.  The foundation of China-Africa cooperation is solid and well fostered over many decades and Africa has been the destination of the China foreign minister's first foreign visit in a year for 32 consecutive years. Trade between China and Africa reached an all-time high in 2021 of $254 billion, from about $10 billion in 2000, according to Xinhua News Agency. Liu also noted that through COVID-19 pandemic and Russia-Ukraine conflicts, Africa countries have increasingly realized that direct aid is not resilient against major global challenges and the continent is striving to find internal driving forces for development.The potential of China-Africa cooperation can therefore be better explored and diverse programs on infrastructure and industrial production are expected to prosper, Liu said. Against the backdrop of China-US competition and the Ukraine crisis, Antony Blinken visited South Africa, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Rwanda from August 7-12, on the heels of Russia Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov's tour to the continent. China never sees investment and cooperation with Africa as an exclusive opportunity, because ""the continent is big enough to receive global partners."" However, the US' true purpose behind its sudden interest in a continent US has long ignored is all too apparent.""We're back to Cold War-style strategic diplomacy,"" in which superpowers try to convince Africa countries that their narrative is the right one, and vie for their support, The New York Times reported on August 7. Africa suffered a great deal from colonialism and West hegemony, and has seen through US' strategic calculations. Fulufhelo Netswera, Executive Dean of the Faculty of Management Sciences at the Durban University of Technology and a former director of the South Africa BRICS Think Tank, wrote in an opinion piece that the US has little chance of success in creating a wedge between China and Africa. With its Cold War memory still fresh, Africa states won't be fooled by the West and are taking an independent and pragmatic approach in dealing with major powers. Though the influence of their colonial past remains strong, especially on security, Africa states are fighting for greater autonomy, experts said.",CHINA,DIPLOMACY,State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'China': ('LOC', 11), 'Africa': ('LOC', 11), 'US': ('LOC', 1), 'Poland': ('LOC', 1), 'Russia': ('LOC', 1), 'Ukraine': ('LOC', 1), '8th': ('MISC', 1), 'Conference': ('MISC', 1), 'COVID - 19': ('MISC', 1), 'Xi': ('MISC', 1), 'Forum on China - Africa Cooperation': ('ORG', 1), 'FOCAC': ('ORG', 4), 'Foreign Ministry': ('ORG', 1), 'Center for Africa Studies': ('ORG', 1), 'Peking University': ('ORG', 1), 'Global Times': ('ORG', 1), 'Agency': ('ORG', 1), 'CO': ('ORG', 1), 'Wang': ('PER', 1), 'Wang Yi': ('PER', 2), 'Wang Wenbin': ('PER', 2), 'Wang Wen': ('PER', 2), 'Liu Haifang': ('PER', 2)}"
13,"As the US attempts to sustain hegemony, China, Russia safeguard international order, justice",Global Times,2022-08-18,"How to evaluate the strength of a major power? To see its attitude toward its opponents. In his press briefing on Wednesday, US State Department Spokesman Ned Price referred to China-Russia relationship as a ""burgeoning"" one, which is ""of concern"" because the vision they have for the international order is ""starkly at odds to the liberal vision"" and ""with the underpinnings of the international system that have been in place for some eight decades following the end of the Second World War.""The US concerns toward China and Russia are also reflected in the latest massive coverage in the West media about China sending troops to Russia to participate in the ""Vostok"" exercises, and the hype of the so-called threat from the two countries.A thief crying ""stop thief."" The US' concerns about the China-Russia relationship are the product of US' own strategic anxiety. US worries that the US-centered international order established after World War II would collapse, and the coordination between China and Russia in the security realm could offset US' influence in the international order the US has long dominated.US' strategic anxiety stems from the fact that the US is declining, said Zhang Tengjun, deputy director of the Department for Asia-Pacific Studies at the China Institute of International Studies. ""The US maintains its strategic competition posture with China and Russia simultaneously in the directions of Ukraine and the Asia-Pacific. Under such circumstances, if China and Russia get closer, it will affect US' deployment of resources in the two directions and hinder its efforts to dominate regional order. But US' current strength does not allow it to focus on both,"" said Zhang.The mismatch of US' strength and its mentality of viewing itself as the world's No.1 is the root cause of the existing division and chaos of the world. Zhang held the view that the crux of the problem is not what China and Russia have done or not done, but whether the US and the West can overcome their fears and anxiety about their own decline.From the perspective of the international order, the US is the most prominent representative of hegemonism, while China and Russia are actually defending the international order, fairness and justice. Cui Heng, an assistant researcher at the Center for Russia Studies at China Normal University, believes that the strategic cooperation between China and Russia injects positive momentum into the international community. ""When the US-led NATO bombed Yugoslavia more than 20 years ago, no force could restrain the hegemony of the US. Can the US still do this today? Obviously not. At the regional level, the coordination between China and Russia is a constructive force. Taking Afghanistan as an example. The US left a mess, but in the end it is China, Russia and other neighboring countries that are helping clean up the mess,"" said Cui, adding that those who twist China-Russia relations reflect their wretched purposes, short-sightedness as well as failure to understand that the continuous strengthening of this bilateral relationship serves for world peace and stability.Henry Kissinger, former US secretary of state, said in a recent interview with the Wall Street Journal that ""we are at the edge of war with Russia and China on issues which we partly created, without any concept of how this is going to end or what it's supposed to lead to."" Sadly, even though Kissinger's advice serves for US interests, the mainstream elites in the US who have slipped into the abyss of US political correctness won't heed such advice. If the US goes its own way to become enemies with China and Russia, it is isolating itself in the world.",OPINION,VIEWPOINT,Illustration: Chen Xia/GT,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'US State Department': ('ORG', 1), 'Department for Asia - Pacific Studies': ('ORG', 1), 'China Institute of International Studies': ('ORG', 1), 'Center': ('ORG', 1), 'NATO': ('ORG', 1), 'Ned Price': ('PER', 1), 'Zhang Tengjun': ('PER', 3), 'China': ('LOC', 11), 'Russia': ('LOC', 11), 'US': ('LOC', 16), 'West': ('LOC', 2), 'Ukraine': ('LOC', 1), 'Asia': ('LOC', 1), 'Pacific': ('LOC', 1), 'Yugoslavia': ('LOC', 1), 'Second World War': ('MISC', 1), 'Vostok': ('MISC', 1), 'World War II': ('MISC', 1)}"
15,More bad news from China: the UK media's dangerous game,Mark Blacklock,2022-08-19,"It is difficult for a West journalist to report about China in an unbiased manner. The reasons for this are four fold: professional, ideological, geopolitical and - tying them all together - financial.International events coverage has changed massively in the UK in barely a generation. Decades ago, I worked for a national newspaper which once boasted a correspondent in every capital city on Earth, and I was eventually left occupying the outpost most distant from its London HQ - a small provincial English town about 250 miles to the north. As all media similarly shrank their staff, they relied on fewer sources of information and so fostered a narrower worldview among their listeners, viewers and readers. The nature of West reporting also has an impact. Newsgathering's predominant focus is not on the ordinary, but the extraordinary: a disaster or failure becomes news more readily than everyday life. This media lens, and fewer staff to seek alternatives, normalizes the hearing of bad news from China.Reporters making innumerable subjective judgements in the process of assembling a story they are supposed to tell objectively, are always at risk from unconscious bias. But they can also be expected to parrot their employers' editorial line, and an unbalanced story can masquerade as an authentic piece of journalism. It can be more subtle than crudely distorting facts. What is written can be less important than how it is written. What is included can be less important than what is left out. The choice of language and emphasis is key. Coverage of China events can seem like a barrage of hypercritical rhetoric, not always contiguous with the facts. It can shape public opinion with loaded language like ""threat,"" ""challenge,"" or ""aggression."" Demonstrations become ""riots,"" deradicalization programs become ""repression,"" schools become ""camps.""Many media organizations, particularly in the UK and the US, also have a built-in news agenda which determines stories from China, good or bad, being told in a partisan way which reflects poorly on Beijing. The reasons for this are complex, but media ownership is critical to the way decisions are made. Billionaires and conglomerates control the media in the UK and the US, a concentration of ownership which enables a wealthy elite to control the flow of information to people in an economic system in which the media are an integral part and which they need to protect. In 2021, 90 percent of UK's national newspapers were owned by three companies (including, obviously Rupert Murdoch's). This year, 90 percent of the US media is controlled by just six giant corporations whose executives similarly call the news shots. Right-wing think tanks such as the US government-funded National Endowment for Democracy produce ""research"" which feeds into the media machine, often repeated without challenge. In this way, governments get column inches with a veneer of veracity as easily as buying advertising space.By faithfully promoting a status quo which essentially serves the preservation of US hegemony (and where the US leads in foreign affairs, the UK almost invariably follows), the media are a powerful weapon in the projection of West foreign policy. They were used to encourage support for war in Afghanistan and Iraq, for deep military involvement in Ukraine and are now being mobilized to generate anti-China sentiment over Taiwan.  Ideologically, West capitalism's most overriding concern is for self-preservation and it sees China's alternative system of governance as a challenge. It believes that anything undermining the US global supremacy that US has always taken for granted must be confronted. China's extraordinary economic miracle which has lifted 800 million people out of poverty in a system of socialism with China characteristics is seen as a threat to neoliberal values.The West addresses this perceived threat with what it understands best: force. This can be economic sanctions or tariffs, or military might, such as the ring of US military outposts which circle China like a noose, or a naval presence around China territorial waters. Most recently, there was the confected outrage over Taiwan triggered by Nancy Pelosi's provocative visit. It was no coincidence that President Joe Biden's Chips and Science Act followed quickly. He walked through a door which Pelosi opened, and which the media held ajar. Now, relations between China and the US are worse than for decades.News coverage of China in the UK is dominated by a handful of subjects, and all of them are framed in a manner representing China's action in these areas as a threat to West interests in specific areas: the economy, foreign policy, military and security, China's unique political system is presented as a threat to US dominant, pre-eminent position on the world stage (and therefore to its allies, like UK).The consequences of this type of unremitting negative coverage can be measured by only one metric, that of rising tensions between nations. As most recently demonstrated in the role it played in ramping up tension over Taiwan, this kind of media behaviour leads only in one direction: down, towards the risk of conflict. The way the media reports on China, at the behest of governments - wittingly or unwittingly - can only risk destabilizing a region where stability should be the only way forward. It's a dangerous game to play.The author is a journalist and lecturer living in UK. opinion@globaltimes.com.cn",OPINION,VIEWPOINT,Illustration: Xia Qing/GT,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'West': ('MISC', 2), 'English': ('MISC', 1), 'China': ('LOC', 4), 'UK': ('LOC', 4), 'Earth': ('LOC', 1), 'London': ('LOC', 1), 'US': ('LOC', 2), 'Beijing': ('LOC', 1)}"
16,Russia becomes 3rd-largest market for yuan payments in July as bilateral trade remains normal; may climb further: analyst,GT staff reporters,2022-08-19,"China's yuan has retained its position as the fifth most active currency for global payments by value in July, signaling a stable internationalization pace; meanwhile, Russia has jumped to become the third-largest market using the yuan for global payments, a report from the global financial messaging firm Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT) showed on Friday.Yuan's share stood at 2.2 percent in July, up from the 1.86 percent in June and was behind the US dollar, the euro, the UK pound and Japan yen. Among them, the US dollar and yuan were the two currencies that saw expansion of use in the month. The share of US dollar expanded to 41.COVID-19 percent in July from the 38.77 percent in June, retaining its position as the most used global payment currency. Euro edged down to 35.49 percent in July from the 36.46 percent in June, and the pound dropped to 6.45 percent from the 7 percent a month ago. While the share of Japan yen dipped to 2.82 percent from 3.46 percent.In terms of international payments excluding payments within the Eurozone, the yuan ranked sixth with a share of 1.51 percent in July 2022.""The increasing share is a vivid demonstration that yuan's recognition and acceptance has seen a steady growth worldwide backed by a relatively stable exchange rate compared with other major currencies despite global volatiles,"" Dong Dengxin, Director of the Finance and Securities Institute of the Wuhan University of Science and Technology, told the Global Times on Friday.Dong noted that the share of yuan's use in global trade is even more if calculated in some border trade.In a major show of growing global recognition of the China currency, the IMF has lifted the China yuan's weight in the Special Drawing Rights (SDR) currency basket to 12.28 percent from 10.92 percent in its first regular review of the SDR valuation since the China currency was included in the basket in 2016, the People's Bank of China, the country's central bank, said in a statement in May.

Yuan's weighting in IMF Special Drawing Rights currency basket from 2016 to 2022 Graphic: GTZhou Maohua, a macroeconomic analyst at Everbright Bank told the Global Times on Friday that an increasing share demonstrates an accelerated pace of yuan's internationalization amid global uncertainties, while the proportion of yuan in global payments still does not match the size of China's economy and trade volume, indicating vast growth potential.The proportion of payments still has a lot of room for development compared to the US dollar and the euro, Zhou said, predicting that the role of the yuan in international payments, investment and reserves will continue to increase with an improving domestic economy.More worth noting is that Russia has jumped to become the third-largest market for yuan payments. The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region remains the top source of yuan transactions outside China mainland with 73.8 percent of the total, followed by the UK which accounted for 6.4 percent.Observers attributed the jumping share to a stable trade between China and Russia amid US-led West sanctions. In July, the trade volume between China and Russia came in at $16.79 billion. Among them, China's exports to Russia amounted to $6.77 billion, while China's imports from Russia amounted to $10.02 billion, both expanding from June.In the first seven months of 2022, China's trade with Russia rose 29 percent year-on-year to $97.71 billion, accelerating 1.8 percentage points from first half of the year.The SWIFT report showed that Russia firms and banks were involved in almost 4 percent of international yuan payments by value in July. That was an increase from 1.42 percent the previous month and from zero in February when the Russia-Ukraine conflict began.""If sanctions on Russia continue, the share will continue to increase in its use,"" Dong said. Observers noted that pursuing of local currency settlements in trade between the two countries also provides more convenience for bilateral traders to stabilize foreign trade and avoid US dollar hegemony.Wang Wentao, China's Commerce Minister said during a virtual meeting with Russia Economic Development Minister Maxim Reshetnikov in early August that since the beginning of the year, China-Russia trade has maintained strong growth momentum.The two sides should continue consolidating trade in key commodities while tapping into new growth areas such as digital economy, green development, cross-border e-commerce and trade in services, and push for a steady growth of China-Russia economic and trade cooperation, Wang said.",SOURCE,ECONOMY,Photo: IC,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'China': ('LOC', 5), 'Russia': ('LOC', 1), 'US': ('LOC', 3), 'UK': ('LOC', 1), 'Japan': ('LOC', 2), 'Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication': ('ORG', 1), 'SWIFT': ('ORG', 1), 'Yuan': ('ORG', 2), 'Eurozone': ('ORG', 1), 'Finance and Securities Institute': ('ORG', 1), 'Wuhan University of Science and Technology': ('ORG', 1), 'Global Times': ('ORG', 2), 'IMF': ('ORG', 2), 'Rights': ('ORG', 2), 'SDR': ('ORG', 2), 'People': ('ORG', 1), 'GTZ': ('ORG', 1), 'Maobright Bank': ('ORG', 2), 'Euro': ('MISC', 1), 'Dong Dengxin': ('PER', 2)}"
17,Türkiye seeks to settle row with Russia over nuclear plant construction,Xinhua,2022-08-19,"Türkiye is seeking to resolve a dispute with Russia regarding the construction of Türkiye's first nuclear power plant, a key component of growing bilateral energy cooperation.The Akkuyu plant constructed by Russia's state nuclear energy corporation Rosatom in south Türkiye's Mersin province has set an operational date for the first reactor by 2023, with the entire plant expected to be up and running by 2025.For Mithat Rende, a former Turkey ambassador and an analyst on energy affairs, the Akkuyu plant, which began with a 2010 intergovernmental agreement between Türkiye and Russia, is of ""strategic"" importance.""The Akkuyu power plant is of strategic importance for Türkiye because it has to work towards enhancing its energy security of supplies,"" Rende, also a member of the Turkey delegation that negotiated the nuclear plant deal with Russia, told Xinhua.""We need to build and operate the Akkuyu power plant as soon as possible ... the first reactor was due to be operational in 2018 but there were too many delays,"" Rende said, noting that new delays could happen given Türkiye's economic and financial woes as well as the recent West sanctions imposed on Russia due to the Russia-Ukraine conflict.Last week, Turkey Energy Minister Fatih Donmez said his government was seeking to resolve a legal dispute between Rosatom and local contractors.""Problems have not been overcome, and our initiatives continue. We will not allow any disruption in the project calendar,"" he told the state-run Anadolu Agency.Once completed, the plant is expected to produce up to 10 percent of electricity in Türkiye.The row was also on the agenda of Russia and Turkey leaders during a meeting in Russia's Sochi earlier this month.Following discussions, an agreement was reached between Russia President Vladimir Putin and his Turkey counterpart Recep Tayyip Erdogan on expanding cooperation in the economic and energy sectors.The Turkey leader stressed the importance of the nuclear project and ruled out any postponement. He denied rumors that the project has been delayed.Erdogan visited the construction site following his return from Sochi.A Turkey source close to the government, which has knowledge of the matter, told Xinhua that the construction process is still ""on track.""This source, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said that the Ankara government was ""confident"" that the recent Russia-Turkey summit gave ""clear signs"" that bilateral nuclear cooperation was still moving forward.The fact that both countries are in close contact over energy issues and the current dispute reflects the sound basis of their partnership, said Ilyas Kemaloglu, a scholar from Istanbul's Marmara University.""The sincere dialogue established between Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Vladimir Putin and the need of the two countries for each other is to the benefit of both nations,"" he said.""In today's conditions, as a door opening to the world for Russia, Türkiye is increasing its prestige and weight in the international arena as it is the only country in communication with both Russia and the West,"" the scholar added.

A number of China companies have made technological breakthroughs in the manufacture of neutral borosilicate glass and have established production capacity.According to the China Association for Vaccines, the annual output of vaccine vials in China could reach 8 billion.Facing a potential global vaccine vials shortage, domestic producers have actively prepared production capacity to meet growing market demand.""At present, we have received orders from EU countries, with a rise in the number of orders and inquiries. The company has sufficient production capacity to meet overseas market demand,"" Shandong Pharmaceutical Glass Co told the Global Times on Wednesday.Another glass-making enterprise requesting anonymity said that it is aware of a shortage of glass bottles in Germany, and recently received inquiries from EU. ""We are actively making preparations,"" it told the Global Times on Wednesday.China's glass industry has seen rapid development. According to the China Daily Glass Association, the output of daily-use glass products and glass packaging containers in the first half of 2021 reached 13.7 million tons, a cumulative increase of 15.70 percent year-on-year.The export value of the daily-use glass industry totaled $3.49 billion, up 52.06 percent. ""In 2021, in the face of multiple challenges including COVID-19, the industry achieved high year-on-year growth in production and exports. Entering 2022, combined with the effective control of the virus, central and local governments ramped up support for small enterprises, including the glass industry, to address their difficulties,"" the association said in a report.Foreign enterprises also hold a bullish view of China's glass manufacturing industry. SCHOTT AG opened a new factory in China's Zhejiang Province in June 2021, with production capacity of 20,000 tons after the first phase is completed.""The opening of the factory will alleviate market shortage of vaccine vials, and guarantee a stable supply of neutral borosilicate glass, providing more support for the world's anti-virus action,"" the company said.""China's manufacturing industry including the glass sector has made a great contribution to stabilizing global industrial chains since the outbreak of COVID-19, thanks to the country's effective control measures against the virus,"" Cong Yi, a professor at the Tianjin University of Finance and Economics, told the Global Times on Wednesday.Despite the pandemic and global energy crisis, the country's overseas manufacturing capability is expected to strengthen, Cong noted.",SOURCE,ECONOMY,"A staff member displays a sample of the COVID-19 inactivated vaccine at a vaccine production plant of China National Pharmaceutical Group Co., Ltd.

19,A trade war with China? It is the last thing Europe should consider: Global Times editorial,Global Times,2022-08-17," Is a trade war likely to break out between China and EU? This is a dangerous topic that the public opinion in EU, including Germany, has been hyping up. China and EU in recent years have been the major trading partner of each other, and weathered many storms together. With a highly complementary industrial chain and great economic interdependence, it stands to reason that the trade war should not have become a serious topic in EU's China policy discussion. However, some media have portrayed an ""upside-down world"" for Europeans: High economic dependence between China and EU is not a dividend but ""risk"" for the continent, while others say EU must prepare for a conflict with China. It must be pointed out that for EU, the damage these public opinion countercurrents would bring cannot be ignored. At present, the EU economy is facing multiple challenges including the Russia-Ukraine conflict, energy crisis, high inflation, repeated COVID-19 outbreaks, and lasting periods of high temperatures and droughts. At a time EU should cherish peace, an external environment favorable to development and mutually beneficial partners, some people in the continent intend to artificially create conflicts with China. Is it just simply because China has become increasingly important for EU interests, the continent therefore must decouple from, guard against and repulse China? It's impossible for a normal person not to eat because he is afraid of being chocked. It's even less likely that he will smash the rice bowl. In sum, the EU opinion now mainly focuses on two issues. First is whether to voluntarily reduce economic and trade dependence on the China market, or decouple from China in other words, to avoid being into a passive position in the future. Second, if EU doesn't accept some of China's policies and decisions, should it resort to trade sanctions? Obviously, many Europeans have been obsessed with these two problems, but it's fair to say there is indeed a problem with raising the two issues.     Regarding the first issue, the close economic and trade relations between China and EU should not be interpreted as a one-way dependence of one party on the other, but rather as a normal ""interdependence."" The EU economy, especially the Germany economy, is highly externally oriented, which is determined by the general trend of economic globalization that EU has grasped and thus fully gained the benefits. According to a report issued by the IFO Institute, a trade war and a decoupling of the EU and Germany from China would cost Germany almost six times as much as Brexit. The former US president Donald Trump wielded the stick of tariffs on many countries during his tenure, which was firmly opposed by EU, especially France and Germany. As the harm caused by the trade war at that time is still lingering in the EU continent today, the word ""trade war"" should not appear in the EU public opinion in particular. The second issue mirrors the arrogance and prejudice deep in some people's minds in EU toward China. They are used to judging others, including China with a sense of superiority. In their view, economic and trade sanctions can be used as a political suppression bargaining chip. In fact, EU is in no position nor has the power to do so. To a large extent, the first issue is measuring others according to EU's own standard and such mindset. The two issues are two sides of the same coin, reinforcing each other. Those who urge to suppress China are anxious and fearful about China's rising importance. We would also like to remind that some people in EU should not think about creating conditions for challenging China's core interests by reducing their economic and trade dependence on China, which is putting the cart before the horse.There are indeed many things that are troubling EU and have provided a breeding ground for various extremist views. China, which is far away from EU, has become a target for some people to vent their dissatisfaction. But none of the abovementioned problems are caused by China. And it's the wrong way to ease the anxiety by poisoning China-EU mutual trust foundation and undermining China-EU economic cooperation. In recent years, the US has exerted a strong traction on EU over major geopolitical issues. The result is the US benefited, while EU fell. Now, EU needs to sort out domestic affairs and figure out how much of its anxiety around China really comes from China, and how much comes from surrendering strategic autonomy to the US. Former Germany chancellor Helmut Schmidt reportedly said Germany should be careful not to be the moral apostle of the world. This sentence also applies to the entire EU today. A number of EU economists recently told media that people need to separate political differences from normal trade and China deserves due respect, warning EU against short-sighted actions. Their reminder is targeted as public opinion in EU is showing worrying tendency. Some of the content seem to be copied from the US. But EU is not a state of the US. This important fact cannot be ignored by the Europeans, otherwise, it's easy to fall into a big hole specifically dug for EU.",OPINION,EDITORIAL,Photo: VCG,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'China': ('LOC', 12), 'Germany': ('LOC', 2), 'Russia': ('LOC', 1), 'Ukraine': ('LOC', 1), 'EU': ('ORG', 15), 'Institute': ('ORG', 1), 'Europeans': ('MISC', 2), 'COVID - 19': ('MISC', 1)}"
20,Transcript of Ambassador Qin Gang's Interview with the US Mainstream Media,Chinese Embassy in the United States,2022-08-17,"On August 16, Ambassador Qin Gang took a joint interview of the US mainstream media in US DC, including Reuters, Associated Press, Bloomberg, National Public Radio, The US Post, The Wall Street Journal, The New Yorker, The Hill, POLITICO, Axios, Defense One, and he answered questions on China-US relations, the Taiwan question, Hong Kong-related issues, and China's diplomacy. The transcript of the interview is as follows:Josh Rogin (The US Post): Mr. Ambassador, thank you so much for taking time today. Recently, your counterpart in Paris, China ambassador in France, said on two separate occasions that the China government was planning for reeducation of the Taiwanese people after reunification. Can you explain to US what that means? What does that look like? Is the reeducation modeled after Hong Kong? Or is it modeled after Xinjiang? Is it modeled after Tibet? What kind of reeducation are you planning after reunification?Ambassador Qin Gang: I don't know under what circumstances and in what context our Ambassador said this. But my personal understanding is that people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait are China and the mainland and Taiwan belong to one and the same China. We need to reinforce the identity, our national identity. So I think this is what he really means, but I can't speak for him.Josh Rogin: A quick follow up. You mentioned that in your op-ed in The US Post that published it that peaceful reunification is the preference, and that seems to me that you need to persuade the Taiwanese people to join back with China voluntarily. How's that going? How goes your efforts to win the hearts and minds of the Taiwanese people? You think it's working?Ambassador Qin Gang: As a matter of fact, over the past years the mainland has done many things to promote the peaceful development of cross-Strait relations. We have shown our goodwill. Taiwan is a small place. Its market is limited, and there's not big room for Taiwan to develop its economy and livelihood. The future of Taiwan depends on the reunification with the mainland, and over the past decades, we've done so much. For example, there are one million Taiwan people living on the mainland. They are happy. They are doing their business, and they are opening their factories. They are studying on the mainland. Over the past years, the trade volume has doubled to more than $320 billion. Taiwan enjoyed $170 billion in surplus. The mainland is the largest trading partner and the largest source of trade surplus for Taiwan, and we have very frequent travel across the Taiwan Strait. I think that helps the understanding, mutual understanding.Josh Rogin: So why do you think that the Taiwanese people overwhelmingly say they don't want to join the mainland?Ambassador Qin Gang: We try to achieve peaceful reunification. It is our wish, because we believe that serves interests of the people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait. People on both sides are compatriots. The last thing we do is fight with our compatriots. We will make our utmost efforts and show the greatest sincerity to achieve peaceful reunification. The reason for US not to renounce non-peaceful means for reunification is not targeting at the China people in Taiwan. It is to deter a small number of separatist forces and to deter foreign intervention. For the arrangements after the reunification, we have proposed the philosophy of ""One Country, Two Systems"". This is the best design for Taiwan. ""One Country, Two Systems"" was first put forward to resolve the Taiwan question. We believe it has fully considered Taiwan's realities, and it's conducive to Taiwan's long-term stability and prosperity. As for how to deliver it, we will take suggestions from people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait and fully accommodate the interests, sentiments of our brothers and sisters in Taiwan. ""One Country, Two Systems"" is still the most inclusive solution to resolve the Taiwan question. It's a peaceful, democratic and win-win solution that shows our goodwill. Different political systems are not an obstacle to reunification and they are not a pretext to separate Taiwan from China. So we believe that as the China nation realizes reunification, there will be greater room and possibilities for the implementation of the Taiwan solution of ""two systems"".Steve Clemons (The Hill): Ambassador, if I may, you have said very specifically that the US said that you're looking at Pelosi trip as an excuse for China to set a new normal, basically saying that China was escalating the situation. One of the features that I saw in this was that a lot in the administration have serious reservations about Nancy Pelosi's trip. We actually saw they were divided within the administration. So who in the administration is actually telling you that China is using this pretext to change the status quo?Ambassador Qin Gang: It's not a secret to US. Last Friday I think, a senior official of the National UN did a press briefing, blaming China for escalating the situation and using the visit as a pretext.Steve Clemons: So it's Kurt Campbell.Ambassador Qin Gang: It's on the record. It's recorded in the media.Phelim Kine (POLITICO): Mr. Ambassador, a quick question, we've seen (inaudible) of the US, in Missouri and Pennsylvania and other places, where the idea of China threat is a big part of the political rhetoric, political discourse. It seems pretty likely that the fallout in this country from the PLA's response to Pelosi's visit to Taiwan is gonna accentuate that. And I guess my question to you is, are you concerned that we're going to see this idea of China threat being part of midterm election rhetoric? I wonder, do you have a message to US lawmakers and to US voters about how they should be seeing China? Thank you.Ambassador Qin Gang: I've been here as the ambassador for a year. And I have found that I'm in an environment of ""threat-phobia"". My country is being greatly mis-perceived and miscalculated as a challenge or even a threat to the US, as you mentioned just now. And this relationship, which is so important and so consequential, is now being driven by fear, not by common interests and common responsibilities. If you listen to the words and see the behaviors of the politicians in this country, it's not difficult to draw this conclusion. But I want to say that China is not a threat, it's not a challenge. China's development intention is just to get a better life for its people. We have no intention to replace the US and to destroy the US. We just want our people to lead a happy life. We need a peaceful and cooperative external environment, including, particularly, our relations with the US, so that we can focus on our domestic construction. But sadly, our intention is misunderstood. So I do hope that people can get rid of the ""threat-phobia"" and not blame China for everything, every problem of this country. China and the US are different. China cannot change the US. The US cannot change China. We have differences. But differences cannot justify groundless blames and crazy, unreasonable words and deeds. And we should not let differences and disagreements stand at the center of the stage of our relations. We should not let them define our relations. If people handle this relationship out of fear of China, it will cause tensions, tensions after tensions. It will put our relations on a wrong track, and very dangerously lead our relations to the course or direction of conflict and confrontation.Mary Louise Kelly (NPR): There's been a lot of conversations in US over what lessons China is taking from Russia's invasion of Ukraine. And I wonder if you would answer that. What are you learning as you watch the war unfolding in Ukraine? Do you see parallels? Do you see differences?Ambassador Qin Gang: I don't know what lessons the US should take from the Ukraine crisis. China is not a party in the crisis, not in history, not in reality. Everybody knows the root cause of the crisis. This is not between China and Ukraine. China is not NATO. Why this crisis happened? There are historical complexities and realistic considerations. What Russia wants cannot be given by China. China is a force for peace. At the very beginning of the crisis, China calls for peace, for ceasefire, for political solution through diplomatic consultations. And we don't send weapons, ammunitions. What China has sent to Ukraine are sleeping bags, medicine, humanitarian aid. So if there's any lesson to be drawn by the US, by NATO, or by other parties involved, maybe that is how to achieve security. A country cannot build its security at the cost of other countries. And all countries' legitimate security concerns have to be taken into considerations. It's not a zero-sum game, and Cold-War mentality is not a solution to security issues in modern world.That's why President Xi Jinping has proposed the Global Security Initiative, calling for all countries to join hands in building up a security which is common, comprehensive, shared and sustainable. I do hope that sooner or later the parties concerned in the crisis will come to the negotiation table to find a way out of the current difficulty, so that people can negotiate a future framework of the security.David Ignatius (The US Post): Mr. Ambassador, I'd like to ask you about strategic stability between the US and China. You spoke in Aspen, I remember, about the importance of stability between the two countries. President Joe Biden, last November in his phone call with President Xi Jinping, proposed that there be talks about strategic stability between these two nuclear powers. But so far as I know, those talks have not proceeded to any meaningful level despite your comments in Aspen and other China comments. So a question at a time when the tensions between the US and China are so obviously high and dangerous over Taiwan: Is China ready for these conversations? And do you expect that President Xi Jinping and President Joe Biden may meet together this year for discussion of this and other issues?Ambassador Qin Gang: First of all, on the possible summit between the Presidents, I have no idea at the moment. I have no information to share with you on this. And on strategic stability, of course China values a stable relationship with the US, and we also believe that as members of P5, China and the US share common responsibility for world peace and stability. We want to have communication and dialogue with the US side on this. But our understanding of strategic stability is not only about the military. It's not only on military terms. Actually it's about political foundation. It's like a house. For this house to be firm and stable, we need a solid foundation. The same theory applies to state-to-state relations. So what is the foundation of China-US relations? That is the one-China principle. That is the stipulations of the three joint communiques. We cannot talk about strategic stability without paying attention to the political foundation of our bilateral relations. If the political foundation, particularly the one-China principle is eroded, undermined, the whole building of China-US relations will be shaken, and it's not good for our two countries and not good for the world.Paul Beckett (The Wall Street Journal): (inaudible) Some cooperation between the two countries has suspended after Pelosi's visit, such as on climate. What do you want to see the US do to resume cooperation?Ambassador Qin Gang: About climate change?Paul Beckett: Any of the places that are frozen, what do you want to see for change?Ambassador Qin Gang: We are taking countermeasures. They shouldn't be surprised. Because before the visit, we warned the US side time and again that if she goes, it will have serious consequences on our exchanges and cooperation between our two countries. So it happened. And we mean what we say. We suspended dialogue, communication and cooperation on some subjects, in some areas, including climate. Now the US said that, by suspending the climate dialogue, China is punishing the world. but the question is, does the US represent the world?Paul Beckett: But what do you want to see in order to resume?Ambassador Qin Gang: To resume, I want to see the US at the moment to think about its own behavior on Taiwan, to reflect on what the true one-China principle is, and to refrain from doing anything more to escalate the tension, because there are some worries around these days in China that the US will take more actions, politically, militarily. If they happen, it will cause a new round of tensions and China will be forced to react.Paul Beckett: How do you view the subsequent congressional delegation?Ambassador Qin Gang: We object to it from the very beginning. Over the past decades, China has opposed congressional visits to Taiwan, because we believe that they are in violation of the one-China principle and the three joint communiques. They violate the commitment of the US of not developing official relations with Taiwan. Congress is part of the government of the US. It's not an independent, uncontrollable branch. It's obliged to abide by the foreign policy of the US. So that's why we object to and are very dissatisfied with Senator Markey's visit to Taiwan. It's provocative and unhelpful.Ellen Knickmeyer (AP): The US says it's going to send warships through the Taiwan Strait, as part of what (inaudible) in the area routinely. Is that a provocation? What's China's response to that?Ambassador Qin Gang: The US side has done too much and gone too far in this region. Since 2012, the US side has had more than 100 navigations through the Taiwan Strait, intensifying the tension and emboldening ""Taiwan independence"" separatist forces. As you have mentioned earlier, we have noted what the US military said these days, that they would have a military exercise or navigation again. But I do call on US colleagues to exercise restraint, not to do anything to escalate the tension. So if there's any move damaging China's territorial integrity and sovereignty, China will respond.Kevin Baron (Defense One): You talked a lot about what you want the US to do to reduce tensions. But can you talk a little bit about what China is going to do to change perceptions here as you mentioned earlier? You see the fear of China ramping up in the political discourse. In fact (inaudible) FBI Director Christopher Wray says in all 50 states, there are active espionage cases against the China, with all sorts of spying and industrial espionage. And as you mentioned in the political sphere, there is a little battle over what US should think about China, whether you can do business with China, in what direction people are supposed to go. What's China going to do to convince more US that they are not a threat, and they should not feel a threat, by all of these different, these rhetorics that US are hearing from their own security officials and their own security news, and what they're seeing in places like Hong Kong where China has removed or forcibly ended democracy and imposed its own system or what it wants?Ambassador Qin Gang: You mentioned the Director of FBI's allegations that China is doing espionage. This is a typical presentation of the fear of China. Espionage activities of China in 50 states — do you believe it? Do you have any evidence or proofs? You should not mistake normal exchanges and interactions as spying. This is a typical threat-phobia. It scares people, scares China people, young people. It scares China communities, and also scares US people doing business and having people-to-people exchanges. It's ideologically driven.You asked the question of Hong Kong. Let me say a few more words. The turbulence in Hong Kong was not caused by any problem with ""One Country, Two Systems"". It was caused by some anti-China forces, who used ""human rights"" and ""democracy"" as a pretext, to manipulate the concept of ""One Country, Two Systems"" and undermine Hong Kong's stability and prosperity.Hong Kong's turbulence was a struggle between secession and anti-secession. Those anti-China forces instigated chaos in Hong Kong, with the support of external forces, to create trouble for China. They asked for ""two systems"" without the ""one country"". Some people even held high the Union Jack, or the Stars and Stripes in Hong Kong, chanting ""two countries, two systems"", and demanding ""Hong Kong independence"" or return to UK colonial rule. Under such circumstances, China's central government had to defend national sovereignty, security and development interests, and safeguard Hong Kong's long-term stability and prosperity.Hong Kong's turbulence was a battle between violence and anti-violence, between law violation and law enforcement. Since the turbulence over proposed legislative amendments in 2019, Hong Kong experienced serious violence, vandalism, arson, traffic obstruction, attacks of police and assault on citizens. Some extremists even stormed the building of Hong Kong Legislative Council. The damage and danger they caused far exceeded the January 6 incident. They seriously jeopardized Hong Kong's security, stability, economy, democracy and even people's lives. You can search for videos of their violent activities on Youtube. You will know that this is never about democracy. This is never a ""beautiful sight to behold"", as Nancy Pelosi called it. Their activities are absolutely crimes. They are violence. The US is doing a reckoning over the January 6 incident. Likewise, Hong Kong will not allow such violent crimes.Facing the turbulences in 2019, China's central government has decisively introduced the Hong Kong national security law, improved the electoral system of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, and adopted the principle of ""patriots governing Hong Kong"". We have taken a host of measures to uphold and improve the ""One Country, Two Systems"". As a result, Hong Kong has realized a major shift from chaos to stability. The ""One Country, Two Systems"" has returned to the right track.Let me emphasize this. Such a shift has proved that ""one country"" is the premise and basis of the ""two systems"", and the ""two systems"" are subordinate to and derived from ""one country."" Doubts of ""One Country, Two Systems"" are short-sighted. It's too early to say that. Those doomsayings about ""One Country, Two Systems"" are doomed to fail. We believe that with ""One Country, Two Systems"", Hong Kong will enter a new era, with vigorous economic and social development and sound governance. I just read a figure, a result of a poll that the US business people's confidence in Hong Kong grew by 18% this year compared to last year.Iain Marlow (Bloomberg): I was actually previously based in Hong Kong until Christmas, and I saw some of my Bloomberg colleagues this morning saying that banks in Hong Kong are now offering hardship money to people to encourage them to move to Hong Kong, because no one wants to come anymore, because of zero-COVID-19 policies. And I was wondering if you could describe a little bit about your vision or how long these measures are gonna be in place. And I'm not talking just about Hong Kong, but in China. We've seen Condoleezza Rice at the Aspen Forum sort of mock the zero-COVID-19 policy and, in terms of it, beginning to hit at China's political reputation, saying that no one wants to replicate China anymore because of these sorts of restrictions that you put on people. I'm wondering if you could give a sense of how long you see these measures being in place and whether you view them as having any negative impact on China's standing in the world or China's integration with other countries, whether that's in Asia or across the world?Ambassador Qin Gang: I don't understand for what reason Condoleezza Rice mocked China's approach to tackle COVID-19. This country has the world record of the highest number of infections, the highest number of deaths. Why she mocked China? Given China's size and population, our work on COVID-19 has been successful and great. You're seeing the number of deaths and infections which are pretty small and seeing that China's economy coming back, experiencing very strong recovery. This is because China puts people in the center of its governance, and the Communist Party of China implements its mission, which is to serve the people wholeheartedly during their efforts to confront COVID-19. We call our approach as the ""dynamic zero-COVID-19"" policy. It's dynamic and it's not rigid. We readjust our policy according to circumstances, particularly the degree of the spread of COVID-19. It protected people, it protected China's economy, and it protected the global supply and industrial chains. If China suffers severely from COVID-19, think about the consequences. China is still manufacturing and providing a variety of products to countries around the world, including the US, at this difficult time.  Of course like in all the countries, COVID-19 has caused great difficulties to traveling and to people's lives. It's understandable. China is no exception. So we hope that the situation of COVID-19 will get relaxed sooner, so that people can enjoy their normal life, economic activities can be brought back and traveling can be restored, which is so important at this moment, because we have tensions between our two countries and we need more interactions, so that people can have correct mutual understanding.Evan Osnos (The New Yorker): Can I have a question of the Taiwan issue again, about the timeline? President Xi Jinping has said this is not an issue that we passed from generation to generation. I'm curious if the events of the last year or two, the conditions in the US-China relationship or more broadly in the world have accelerated that timeline in any way? There was a report recently that some in the US assessed that it may have accelerated China's timeline for reunification. I'm curious if that's the fact.Ambassador Qin Gang: I don't know if there is any specific time, but I do know there is a will. There's a prospect for peace reunification. There's a will of more than 1.4 billion China people for reunification. As what we said in the just published White Paper on the question of Taiwan, the question of Taiwan was caused because of a weak and chaotic China, and must be resolved in the course of national rejuvenation. This is a prospect. And I don't know if there is a timeline. I think that people are over-nervous about it. And there are lots of speculations on that, which I have found baseless.Evan Osnos: I have to follow up just briefly on that. In the event of reunification, how does China anticipate the international reaction to unfold? You expect that the international community would embrace this development or reject this development? And are you prepared to handle the consequences?Ambassador Qin Gang: You mean the consequences for what?Evan Osnos: If for instance, the rest of the world isolating China or international businesses respond by withdrawing there?Ambassador Qin Gang: Why they want to isolate China? Josh Rogin: If you attack them.Ambassador Qin Gang: There's no such a presumption. In the first place, Taiwan is a part of China. The question of Taiwan is a purely internal affair of China, which brooks no foreign intervention. Secondly, as I mentioned earlier, the mainland will pay the utmost efforts in great sincerity to achieve peaceful reunification. they use non-peaceful means only under the circumstances that Taiwan declares independence by a handful of separatist forces and the intervention of foreign forces. Whatever happens, this is purely an internal affair. You mentioned the international community. Let me say this, there are 181 countries having diplomatic relations with China based on the one-China principle. The overwhelming majority of the international community are supportive and accept the one-China policy. On Nancy Pelosi's visit to Taiwan, more than 170 countries (and international organizations) have voiced support for the one-China principle. They take 80% of global population. China has followed international law and basic norms governing international relations. Why countries criticize or isolate China because of an internal affair of China?  So I didn't find any legal and practical basis for that.Michael Martina (Reuters): I can follow up on the notion of the US transits of the Taiwan strait. We have every expectation to believe that US will continue to sell weapons to Taiwan as well, in the near future. You said that China will respond to that, as in the past years of actions. But in this post-Pelosi sort of world, we expect that China will take stronger and more aggressive response to these actions than it has going back years.Ambassador Qin Gang: In the past years, the US has sold many weapons to Taiwan which is in violation of the commitments in the three Sino-US joint communiques, particularly the joint communique of August 17, 1982. Tomorrow will be the 40th anniversary of the August 17 Joint Communique. We need to read some history. They say that people now have no interest in history or in law. And that's how we are in this. Let me read the sentences in the August 17 Joint Communique: ""The US Government states that it does not seek to carry out a long-term policy of arms sales to Taiwan, that its arms sales to Taiwan will not exceed, either in qualitative or in quantitative terms, the level of those supplied in recent years since the establishment of diplomatic relations between the US and China, and that it intends gradually to reduce its sale of arms to Taiwan, leading, over a period of time, to a final resolution."" So 40 years, too long. Has the US resolved this over the past 40 years? No. We haven't seen the US honor its commitments. They are still going on, the arms sales. The quantities are more, and the qualities are more sophisticated. This is written in black and white in the international document. The US government has reneged on this commitment. So of course we are opposed strongly to arms sales from the US. This is the move to change the status quo. This is the move to create tensions. And this is the move to obstruct our efforts to achieve peaceful reunification.David Lawler (Axios): I have another question on ""One China Two Systems"", but just quickly, you said the overwhelming will of the China people is for reunification. I wonder if you accept that based on the many polls in elections that the overwhelming will of people in Taiwan at present — I know you said you want to change that — but at present is not to be unified by China.Ambassador Qin Gang: Let me emphasize this, no matter how different the political systems are between the mainland and Taiwan, the historical fact that both sides belong to one and the same China remains unchanged and will never change. And the fact that people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait are China remains unchanged and will never change. We share the same root, cultural heritage, and national identity. We fully understand Taiwan has been separated from the motherland for decades. We fully understand the (different) political and social systems. We fully understand the sentiments of China people in Taiwan. So that's why we have designed the policy of ""One Country, Two Systems"". That is to accommodate the differences and accommodate the realities and people's sentiments. This is democracy. This is a great invention in the world. Can you imagine that any place in the US has a different political, social system? Although I do understand the federal and local differences, your overarching system is the same. In Taiwan, we have shown great goodwill and tolerance to usher in peaceful reunification. The current political system can continue (after reunification). ""Two systems"" is democracy.David Lawler: Which leads me to my next question. You said ""One Country, Two Systems"" still exists in Hong Kong.Ambassador Qin Gang: Yes.David Lawler: So does Beijing decide what both systems are or does Taiwan decide? For Hong Kong, obviously, Beijing is defining both systems.Ambassador Qin Gang: The future solutions to the political systems, the Taiwan solution, will be negotiated by people of both sides. It's a democratic process. The interests and concerns of Taiwan will be fully considered and accommodated based on the principle of ""one China"". When people talk about ""One Country, Two Systems"", please don't forget the foundation and precondition is ""one China"". We cannot allow the foundation or precondition of ""one China"" to be denied by the ""two systems"". If there's no ""one country"", there will be no ""two systems"".Iain Marlow (Bloomberg): I was just gonna ask if you thought that Hong Kong had a helpful input into how the ""two systems"" practice in Hong Kong. Because the national security law was sent into effect in a hurry. Even people like the Chief Executive and others didn't see it before it was enacted. I'm just wondering when those of US who were in Hong Kong who saw Taiwan opinion change against China over the course of what happened in Hong Kong, I think a lot of people in Taiwan obviously look at what happens in Hong Kong and say, we don't want what is happening there. So do you think the national security law in Hong Kong will be applied to Taiwan as well?Ambassador Qin Gang: Hong Kong has been ruled by UK colonialists for more than 100 years. It's natural that for people to get used to the new reality that Hong Kong has returned to the motherland, it takes time. Hong Kong returned to China just 25 years ago. And over the past 25 years, you can see that generally speaking, ""One Country, Two Systems"", the policy is successful. There were ups and downs, twists and turns, like what we saw 3 years ago in Hong Kong. But we learn, we draw lessons and we improve. What we are doing is improve ""One Country, Two Systems"", for the benefit of the long-lasting stability and prosperity. If we make a success story of ""One Country, Two Systems"" in Hong Kong, it will help our compatriots in Taiwan to better understand the ""One Country, Two Systems"" and to better think about the future.Nahal Toosi (POLITICO): Let me start by how you're approaching all of this. You're sticking to the talking points. You're often not really answering the question. It's pretty standard, I guess, in the diplomatic world. I was just curious as a China diplomat, do you genuinely feel empowered? Do you feel that the Foreign Ministry has power in your system? And where do you see China diplomacy going in the years ahead? Because if the US and China will fight or be rivals, wherever diplomacy is going will be a big credit. Can you talk a little bit about China diplomacy?Ambassador Qin Gang: First of all, I'm the China ambassador, not a freelance journalist (Everyone laughs).  I must represent my government's positions, and the will and wish of the China people. And what I said to you, actually, is heartful. I'm not telling lies, not spreading disinformation, or scaring people. I just tell you the truth and facts. I'm not always sticking to the talking points, as everybody has heard. On thorny issues of course we have talking points, like what officials of the White House and the State Department, they are doing. But I give more elaborations on our policies. And if you draw the conclusion that what I talked about are all stereotypes and rhetorics, I think that you are wasting your time. I really hope that everybody here today will find this conversation necessary and helpful. This is my wish. From my point of view, I gave plenty of information.To answer your question, what is China's diplomacy? China's diplomacy is to be friendly with the rest of the world, to better protect China's interests, as diplomacy of any other countries are doing. And also, China's diplomacy will work for peace, security, and common development. Here in the US, myself and my colleagues would like to be a bridge linking China and US people. I am not here in this country only talking and lecturing. At this difficult moment, I want to listen, communicate with people, reach out to people of different communities, listen to people for their observations. Why our relations now is going downhill? Asking for their wisdom about how can we get out of the difficulty. What can we do to make our relations stable and productive so that our relations will not be driven by fear, but by common interests. And I need people to help, telling me their suggestions so that I can digest and I can report to Beijing. This is my role: a bridge, a listening post and a helping hand.Nahal Toosi: So just be clear, you give each of US a separate interview at some point. You want to be a bridge, sharing our wisdom. And I'm not saying any of US are gonna give you any advice, but maybe...Ambassador Qin Gang: You're always welcome.Steve Clemons (The Hill): Ambassador, a lot of Republicans applauded Nancy Pelosi's trip and a lot of people anticipate, perhaps the Republicans coming in to control the House. And thus you may see another Speaker of the House want to go to Taiwan quickly, maybe Kevin McCarthy, maybe another leader. How would China respond in the case of Speaker of the House going to Taiwan?Ambassador Qin Gang: I have noted that there was no Republican on Nancy Pelosi's visit, although as you mentioned, they are supportive of the visit. And China has always been opposing congressional visits to Taiwan. The Speaker of the House is not a person in the street. He or she carries great sensitivity and importance. And he or she visiting Taiwan is a violation of the US commitment that the US will not maintain official links with Taiwan. I can't answer hypothetical questions. Let's wait and see. But China will make our decisions or take our actions to defend our territorial integrity and national sovereignty. I hope that Nancy Pelosi is the last Speaker to visit Taiwan.Everyone: Thank you, Ambassador.Ambassador Qin Gang: Thank you.",CHINA,DIPLOMACY,Picture description not found,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'Qin Gang': ('PER', 3), 'Josh Rogin': ('PER', 1), 'Josh Rog': ('PER', 1), 'US DC': ('LOC', 4), 'China': ('LOC', 7), 'Paris': ('LOC', 1), 'France': ('LOC', 1), 'Xinjiang': ('LOC', 1), 'Tibet': ('LOC', 1), 'Taiwan Strait': ('LOC', 8), 'Reuters': ('ORG', 1), 'Associated Press': ('ORG', 1), 'Bloomberg': ('ORG', 1), 'National Public Radio': ('ORG', 1), 'The US Post': ('ORG', 3), 'The Wall Street Journal': ('ORG', 1), 'The New Yorker': ('ORG', 1), 'The Hill': ('ORG', 1), 'POLITICO': ('ORG', 1), 'Axios': ('ORG', 1), 'Defense One': ('ORG', 1), 'Hong Kong': ('MISC', 2), 'Taiwanese': ('MISC', 3)}"
21,CSIS’ inflammatory games expose it has no clue how core China’s sovereignty is to its 1.4 billion citizens,Franz Gayl,2022-08-18,"The Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) is ranked as the world's top defense and national security think tank. It was therefore a surprise when it was reported in the open press that CSIS-hosted war games which permitted players to exercise a ground invasion of sovereign China.Eager to demonstrate the value in fighting China, the Marine Corps have been marketing a dubious new doctrine to stake out and service turf in defense of Taiwan island. In exercising their doctrine,  retired Marine players liberally simulated numerous scenarios with only one prohibition, namely no nuclear weapons.One of the selected courses of action was the amphibious assault of a Marine Littoral Regiment on Taiwan, and subsequent combat with China ashore. A US ground invasion of Taiwan was consistent with the US' new strategy for the 1st Island Chain. But CSIS' permitting that inflammatory game move and then cavalierly broadcasting it in the open press was disastrous.The Marines and CSIS would defend the game's rules and conduct. The players came from the private sector. Their authorities to make policy are long past, and games were unclassified and publicized for the sake of transparency. Supposedly, there is a firewall between private sector players and official Pentagon plans and policy makers. As retirees they were just expressing personal opinions informed by open sources.But the benign insignificance of the games defies credulity. CSIS is located within a stone's throw of the White House. Its revered leaders and trustees advise presidents and US defense policy makers, and some of the senior retired game players are highly regarded in US, DC. Any observer would assume that a Marine amphibious assault on Taiwan island is an actual war plans option.Diplomatic sensitivities may be irrelevant to Marines, but not the Intelligence Community (IC) and Department of State (DoS). The DoS and IC delicately manage PRC perspectives of US intentions. So, while CSIS war-game referees were permitting an amphibious assault on Taiwan island, US government  officials were placating the PRC with US commitments to the One China policy.CSIS, the Marines, IC and DoS would dismiss concerns. They will claim the whole world knows Taiwan's status is undetermined, and the China are well aware of this. But that is not true. For China, Taiwan is and always has been sovereign China. If the PRC perceives our willingness to entertain a ground invasion of China, everything has changed.For the China a ground assault across Taiwan's beaches is the same as ground invasions into Fujian, Shandong, or any other province.  They are all sovereign China.Many in the US government draw comparisons between Ukraine and Taiwan. The US thinks of Ukraine as a proxy battlefield. The US kills and maims many Russia and Ukrainians by fueling the conflict with weapons and support provided from the distant safety of US DC. However, the US will not commit troops to the fight because that could cause Russia escalation.Until the senseless gameplay at CSIS, US Taiwan military intervention was expected to follow a similar pattern. Direct US-China kinetic exchanges might occur at sea, in the air, and even space, but like Ukraine, any consideration for the insertion of regiments and divisions of US troops was taboo for Taiwan as well.The US has adopted a false narrative that Taiwanese are not China. The war games apparently showed that Marine-Taiwanese ground forces can fight the China aboard Taiwan island to a stalemate, PRC negotiation, or even outright victory over China.Reckless public promotion of an invasion against a part of China territory by retired Marine war-gamers and CSIS staff, just to market a flawed doctrine could change China assumptions overnight.The possibility of a US ground invasion serves as a dramatic force multiplier that strengthens China resilience beyond measure. Even when it was young and inadequately armed, the PRC defeated the nuclear-armed US in North Korea, a clear indicator of our nuclear peer's unbreakable determination to protect its sovereignty today.For CSIS to permit a US ground invasion of China proves that the US government has no clue how core China's sovereignty is to its 1.4 billion citizens. It is this sort of military and diplomatic ignorance of the China that will embroil US in an unlimited war that the US will lose decisively.There is still a window of opportunity for US, the US public to wise up and prevent the violent catastrophe that our US political leaders have in store for US. But if the US government continues to act stupidly time will assuredly run out.The author is a retired Marine Corps infantry officer and a former Pentagon employee.

The network of 82 routes covers 24 countries and 196 cities in EU, according to data from the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC).In the first half of the year, China's foreign trade with the 24 countries reached 3.45 trillion yuan ($508 billion), up 7.3 percent year-on-year, according to data from the General Administration of Customs.Xu Jianping, director of the Department of Regional Opening-up at the NDRC, said at a press briefing on Thursday that the trains boosted production resumption in relevant countries and strengthened emergency support for international logistics, and they have become increasingly important in ensuring the security of international industry and supply chains.While sea and air shipments were hindered after COVID-19 outbreak, domestic operators of the China-EU Railway Express actively engaged with enterprises for their export needs and customized special trains for groups of companies, including household appliance producer TCL, PC giant Lenovo and Geely Auto, Xu said. A total of 1,150 customized special trains have operated so far in 2022, which effectively eased disruptions on the international industry and supply chains, he said.Shanghai EPU Supply Chain Management Co is an agent for China-EU freight trains that has been engaged in trading business between China and EU for a decade. Tommy Tan, president of the company, told the Global Times on Thursday, ""an increasing number of international customers favor the freight train services.""Since 2018, Shanghai EPU Supply Chain Management Co has used one train per week to deliver goods between Nuremberg and Chengdu, Southwest China's Sichuan Province, with 41 cars for each train, and it has imported all accessories except batteries and air bags for BMW vehicles.The Shanghai-based company also plans for Porsche to transport goods from EU to southwestern China, and directly use the China-EU freight train to move from Bremerhaven to Chengdu and Chongqing, instead of the traditional ro-ro ship from Bremerhaven to Shanghai.The fast development of the China-EU Railway Express is mainly attributed to the mutual recognition of inspection and quarantine, while connections with inland ports such as Southwest China's Chongqing city and Duisburg of Germany make it more efficient for the distribution of goods, Wang Yiwei, director of the Institute of International Affairs at the Renmin University of China, told the Global Times on Thursday.In addition, countries along the route can give full play to their comparative advantages, he said, noting that, for instance, Chongqing exports high value-added products like mobile phones and car components to EU, while returning trains carry agricultural products.As an innovation for international transport services, the freight fees for China-EU Railway Express are only 20 percent of air transport charges, while travel time is only one-quarter of sea shipment, according to a report on the development of the China-EU Railway Express released by the NDRC on Thursday.Amid the Russia-Ukraine crisis, countries along the route of the China-EU Railway Express have joined hands to prevent risks and maintain the sustainable running of the freight trains. ""The number of China-EU freight trains experienced a slight drop in March and April after the outbreak of Russia-Ukraine crisis, but the operation swiftly rebounded in May and returned to the pre-crisis level in May and June,"" Xu said.Despite the headwinds of the pandemic and the geopolitical tensions, countries along the route continue to work hard to maintain smooth operation of the train service, according to industry insiders.An employee surnamed Huang from China-Euro Railway International Logistics told the Global Times on Thursday that some freight trains departing Zhengzhou, Central China's Henan Province that have been delayed, are expected to resume operations in August.Tan said that he still holds firm expectations for the cross-border train service, just like in the beginning of his career, which has helped his trade business flourish, and the service will stay resilient.",SOURCE,ECONOMY,"A train of China Railway Express to Europe carries anti-virus equipment from Yiwu, East China's Zhejiang Province to Madrid, Spain in June Photo: Xinhua",Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'COVID': ('MISC', 1), '19': ('MISC', 1), 'COVID - 19': ('MISC', 3), 'China - EU Railway Express': ('ORG', 6), 'EU Railway Express': ('ORG', 7), 'National Development and Reform Commission': ('ORG', 1), 'NDRC': ('ORG', 2), 'General Administration of Customs': ('ORG', 1), 'Department of Regional Opening': ('ORG', 1), 'up': ('ORG', 1), 'TCL': ('ORG', 1), 'Lenovo': ('ORG', 1), 'Geely Auto': ('ORG', 1), 'Shanghai EPU Supply Chain Management Co': ('ORG', 1), 'Global Times': ('ORG', 1), 'Shanghai EPU': ('ORG', 1), 'Management Co': ('ORG', 1), 'Chengdu': ('ORG', 2), 'Sichuan Province': ('ORG', 1), 'BMW': ('ORG', 1), 'Porsche': ('ORG', 1), 'B': ('ORG', 1), 'Choqing': ('ORG', 1), 'China': ('LOC', 8), 'Nuremberg': ('LOC', 1), 'Southwest China': ('LOC', 9), 'Shanghai': ('LOC', 2), 'Xu Jianping': ('PER', 2), 'Tommy Tan': ('PER', 1)}"
23,China-CEEC Cooperation under the BRI remains a key window for future economic and trade ties despite external disruptions,GT staff reporters,2022-08-18,"China's development in partnership with the Central and EU Countries (CEEC) has borne fruitful results since the mechanism was first initiated in 2012 with both economic and trade between China and the regional countries recording historic growth under the cooperative mechanism and China-proposed Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) connecting East and the West, despite the external disruptions linked to multiple factors including the pandemic, trade and political complexity.Ten years on since the China and CEEC Cooperation was launched, a joint cross-regional platform that was based on the common will of all participants for win-win cooperation and development, has produced solid results. The platform also dealt with new challenges as EU has come to a point where the US and its followers intensified its political-driven dominance to regional affairs, posing unprecedented challenges and potential disruption to ordinary economic and trade cooperation between the region and China, their major trading partner, exemplified by the Baltic countries Latvia and Estonia's recent withdrawal from the China-CEEC Cooperation, experts said.Following in Lithuania's footstep, Latvia and Estonia announced on August 11 their decision not to participate in the China-CEEC Cooperation, or the 16+1 cooperation, a move that experts and business representatives said fits with the US fundamental goal of dismantling the regional cooperative atmosphere and will only serve to shake the confidence among business groups in the region as well as generate uncertainty throughout cross-continental economic and trade development.The US has certainly played its part in attempting to dismantle the China-CEEC Cooperation over its so-called national security concerns as well as its empty-promise of economic input through a number of infrastructure schemes, all linked to the US' fundamental purpose of confronting China, Cui Hongjian, director of the Department of EU Studies at the China Institute of International Studies, told the Global Times on Thursday.In a separate statement issued by the two Baltic countries addressing their withdrawal from the mechanism, they both expressed their strong willingness to strive for a constructive and pragmatic relation with China both bilaterally, as well as through EU-China cooperation, which experts have said is in contrast with the US and Lithuanian position.The attitudes of the two countries over the matter are also in stark contrast with the provocative stance of Lithuania when it announced its decision to stop participating in the cooperative mechanism last May while closely following the US in damaging its relations with China, particularly when it comes to its reckless violation of the one-China principle, a basic norm of international relations and a universal consensus held by the international community, experts said.Concerns over disruptionExperts have noted that regional development needs more collaboration, especially when EU is the midst of heightened tensions as the Russia-Ukraine conflict continues and the corresponding outcomes ignited by the US' provocative approach to the region.Through China-CEEC Cooperation, bilateral trade has achieved significant growth. As a direct witness of the change, Xia Xiaolei, Executive Vice Chairman of Latvian Federation of Oversea China Compatriots, told the Global Times that the cooperation not only has lowered the costs and boosted cargo deliveries as well as personnel exchanges, it also diversified the trade goods between the two countries and China.Xia said that Latvia's withdrawal from China-CEEC Cooperation is ""a very irrational and unwise"" choice, which could bring about various uncertainties for business and trade in the future terms.""Latvia's resistance against Russia goods following the EU's call to sanction Russia has already pushed up the domestic living costs and raised concerns over an energy shortage… the country's withdrawal from the cooperative mechanism with China may only add fuel to its already deteriorated economy,"" Xia said.While it is still too early to tell the exact possible outcomes, it is almost certain that some local companies in Latvia will have to deal with various inconveniences and difficulties after Latvia's pullout, and some substantive changes are expected to take place in bilateral trade, Xia said.""As far as businesses are concerned, these changes may produce worsening results, which is also what we do not want to see,"" Xia said.While Latvia, Estonia's withdrawal from the multilateral partnership may not produce immediate adverse outcome, the investors' confidence and plan for future cooperation in the Baltic region could be shattered, industry insiders said.China companies entered CEEC markets relatively late compared with other markets in EU, and most investments are concentrated on relatively large markets such as Hungary, a business representative of a state-owned infrastructure company told the Global Times on condition of anonymity, noting that the firm, as a result of late market exploration, has only ""limited"" projects in CEEC.""China-CEEC Cooperation is a supplement to overall China-EU economic ties, but certain CEEC have been politicizing normal economic integration under the US pressure, which could impact investors' confidence in those countries,"" the representative said.Hao Ning, a manager from Latvia's RILAK Mineral Paints, told the Global Times on Thursday that they will continue to embrace the China market, which is opening up and sharing development opportunities with the world, despite the world complexity.The painting of Beijing Daxing International Airport, a top infrastructure achievement in China completed last year, was sourced to a lesser-known brand from Latvia, a country not so well-known in China before. This example alone shows China's sincerity in opening up its door and sharing its growth opportunity with the world.Frankly speaking, this kind of sincerity is rare in today's world, Hao said. RILAK paints were used for 80 percent of the wall coating at the Beijing Daxing International Airport.Quitting the platform will definitely mean the loss of certain opportunities, Hao said. ""BRI-related benefits and CEEC-themed dividends are now off the table.""

China's foreign trade by region in 2021 Graphic: GTFacts speak louder than words, China foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said during a regular press conference in June, that ""the above-mentioned achievements are just a microcosm of the fruitful cooperation carried out by the China-CEEC cooperation mechanism over the past 10 years.""Anyone without prejudice will come to the conclusion that China-CEEC cooperation is pragmatic and effective, Zhao said.Ten years ago, when the China-CEEC Cooperation was first launched, many EU countries were dealing with economic problems, ignited by the EU debt crisis, and they valued the positive development prospects of China and the Asia-Pacific region, Cui said.Ten years later, basic conditions have not changed as EU itself is also facing many economic problems, and the Asia-Pacific, especially China, is still the center of world economic development, the expert said.However, something has changed as some EU countries have injected strong political overtones into economic and trade relations, driven by the rising geopolitical tensions in the region, Cui said.While there are opportunities for cooperation between China and Latvia and Estonia, it would be more based on bilateral terms, instead of multilateral terms, Cui said, noting that as the key platform that is established for unleashing full potentials between China and the EU region, its window is ""surely open wider to those within the mechanism compared with those outsiders.""",SOURCE,B&R INITIATIVE,"View of Tallinn, Estonia Photo: VCG",Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'China': ('LOC', 13), 'East': ('LOC', 1), 'West': ('LOC', 1), 'US': ('LOC', 6), 'Latvia': ('LOC', 2), 'Estonia': ('LOC', 2), 'Lithuania': ('LOC', 2), 'Central': ('ORG', 1), 'EU': ('ORG', 3), 'CEEC': ('ORG', 2), 'CEEC Cooperation': ('ORG', 5), 'Department of EU Studies': ('ORG', 4), 'China Institute of International Studies': ('ORG', 1), 'Global Times': ('ORG', 1), 'Countries': ('MISC', 1), 'Belt and Road Initiative': ('MISC', 1), 'BRI': ('MISC', 1), 'Baltic': ('MISC', 2), 'Cooperation': ('MISC', 1), 'Lithuanian': ('MISC', 1), 'Cui Hongjian': ('PER', 1)}"
24,China to join Vostok-2022 Russia with other countries; closer China-Russia ties 'crucial to defend global stability to counter US hegemony',GT staff reporters,2022-08-18,"China troops will go to Russia to participate in the joint military exercises Vostok-2022 with Russia and other countries, according to China's Defense Ministry and experts pointed out that one focus of this year's combined training is to deal with potential threat from the direction of the Pacific Ocean. The cooperation in military and other fields between China and Russia will be further improved despite the increasing hype that the US and the West are the only ones committed in the mission of defending regional and global stability.China's participation in the military exercises was in accordance with the annual plan for cooperation between the militaries of China and Russia and the bilateral agreements. It has nothing to do with the current international and regional situation, China's Ministry of National Defense said in a statement on Wednesday.The statement also noted that the aim for the PLA to participate in the exercises is to deepen concrete and friendly cooperation with militaries from other countries that also attend the exercises and to improve the strategic coordination and capability in dealing with different security threats. India, Belarus, Mongolia, Tajikistan and other countries will also attend the joint military exercises. In July, the Russia Defense Ministry announced to hold the Vostok-2022 exercises from August 30 to September 5. And the exercises will practice employing combat groups in ensuring military security in the eastern region and the drills will bring together the airborne force, long-range and military transport aircraft and also military contingents from other countries, according to Russia news agency TASS. The Vostok-2022 will take place in Russia's eastern region, while Russia troops in the West and southern regions have played a bigger role in the conflict with Ukraine. By holding this year's drills, Russia also wants to show that is has the capability to defend national security in multiple directions, Song Zhongping, a China military expert and TV commentator, told the Global Times on Thursday. The US and West media have also paid close attention to the drills against the backdrop of the current Russia-Ukraine conflict. Some even claimed that Russia is allegedly carrying out some mobilization measures. The Russia defense ministry refuted the disinformation and said in a statement in July that only a part of the Russia Armed Forces is involved in the special military operation in Ukraine and the drills will be provided with the required personnel, armaments, military hardware and materiel.

Photo: Li TangRussia's strategic command and staff drills are very significant and have been held annually for the past four years in different regions. In 2021, Belarus, India, Pakistan, Mongolia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Armenia and Sri Lanka attended the Zapad-2021 drills in Russia's Nizhny Novgorod region, analysts said.China attended the previous three strategic drills and had reportedly sent a lot of troops to overseas in 2018, according to analysts on military. The China military did not participate in the 2021 edition as in August 2021 China and Russia held joint military drills. Compared to the previous four drills, which focused more on fighting against separatism, terrorism and extremism, Vostok-2022 will combine exercises in traditional and non-traditional fields and also take target drills on possible threats especially from the US in the Pacific Ocean direction, Song said.China and Russia, as comprehensive strategic partners of coordination for a new era, have improved cooperation in all sectors and so were exchanges in military, including on military technologies, weaponry and having combined trainings, Song noted. The Vostok-2022 exercises are first and foremost prescribed drills every year but this year's drills have been used by the US and the West to further hype China and Russia threats under special circumstances, especially in the Russia-Ukraine conflict and the unstable situation across the Taiwan Straits, Cui Heng, an assistant research fellow from the Center for Russia Studies of China Normal University, told the Global Times on Thursday.US State Department spokesman Ned Price told reporters Wednesday that US is troubled by the ""burgeoning relationship in the security realm"" between Moscow and Beijing after Russia President Vladimir Putin criticized House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's provocative trip to the island of Taiwan.In response to the US and West's hyping, Song said that the answer to why China and Russia need to further their cooperation is clear because the world is facing various threats and the two countries with their comprehensive strategic partnership need to strengthen cooperation to defend regional and global stability. ""As the two countries have entered into the comprehensive strategic partnership in the new era, the cooperation between the two militaries will surely be further improved. If the US can rally allies in the EU and in Asia to conduct militaries globally with NATO members, South Korea, Japan, Australia or other countries, why can't China have military drills with Russia?"" Song asked. He noted that compared to the those of the US and its allies, China and Russia's drills are restrained, although such joint exercises between the two countries will become frequent and normalized. The US has conducted multiple military drills with its Asia allies and will do so in the coming months. For example, from August 8 to 14, the US, Japan and South Korea participated in a missile warning and ballistic missile search and tracking exercise during the multinational Pacific Dragon exercise off the coast of the Pacific Missile Range Facility in Hawaii. And From August 22 to September 1, the US and South Korea will have their biggest combine military training with potentially tens of thousands of troops involved, US media reported. Analysts said that the US and the West have ramped up efforts in demonizing Russia since the Ukraine crisis and compared the situation in Ukraine with the Taiwan Straits to hype ""China threats."" They have taken China and Russia as a major threat to US' global hegemony and the last thing they want to see is better and closer relations of the two countries. It is a rational choice for China and Russia to embrace and help each other as they face US' efforts aimed at containing them, Cui said, highlighting that it is also a general trend to strengthen military cooperation between the two countries, which however, has nothing to do with the conflict between Russia and Ukraine but is rooted in the continuous strengthening of hegemony and unilateralism pursued by the US since the 20th century. Cui said that China and Russia's cooperation is a positive force to defend the international order amid the challenges the US and its allies posed.Experts also noted that the bilateral cooperation between China and Russia is an indispensable and constructive force for regional security, especially in Eurasia. The US has made a lot of troubles in the region, countries like Afghanistan and Syria are still suffering from the destruction caused by US-inflicted wars, and it is not only the neighboring countries like China and Russia that have to clean up the mess.On the one hand, the US-led West made up the ""China threat"" and ""Russia threat"" to reshape NATO and other alliances, for the sake of forcing them to rely more on the US. On the other hand, the so-called threats from China and Russia have enabled US domestic military-industrial financial groups to ask Congress for more military budgets, Cui said.",CHINA,DIPLOMACY,"The armored assault group rumbles ahead to launch an assault against the forward position of mock terrorists in the China-Russia joint military exercise ZAPAD/INTERACTION-2021 at a training base of the PLA Army in Qingtongxia City of northwest China's Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region from August 9 to 13, 2021.

26,China highly appreciates Putin’s criticism of Pelosi’s provocative Taiwan visit,Zhang Changyue,2022-08-17,"China highly appreciates Russia President Vladimir Putin's criticism of US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's provocative Taiwan visit as Vladimir Putin's position shows China-Russia high-level strategic coordination and the firm support the two countries have rendered each other on issues concerning their core interests, said China Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin on Wednesday.Wang's comments came after Vladimir Putin criticized Pelosi's Taiwan visit as being ""a carefully planned provocation"" at the 10th Moscow Conference on International Security on Tuesday.Vladimir Putin slammed Pelosi's visit to the Taiwan region, saying it was ""not just a trip by a single irresponsible politician, but part of a deliberate, conscious US strategy to destabilize and deteriorate the situation in the region and the world; a brazen display of disrespect for the sovereignty of other countries and for its international obligations. We see this as a carefully planned provocation,"" Russia news agency TASS reported.Vladimir Putin's remarks show Russia's consistent and firm support to China over the Taiwan question with the upholding of the ""four no principles,"" including no recognition of ""Taiwan independence,"" no ""two Chinas"" or ""one China, one Taiwan,"" and no support for Taiwan's membership in international organizations which only sovereign states can join, as well as no weapons sale to Taiwan, said Ding Xiaoxing, director of the Institute of Eurasian Studies at the China Institutes of Contemporary International Relations.Vladimir Putin accused the US of trying to prolong the conflict in Ukraine in his opening address at Moscow Conference on International Security, saying some West countries are trying to divert their domestic public's attention from acute social and economic problems by shifting their own failures onto Russia and China, Tass reported. Ding told the Global Times that the tensions across the Taiwan Straits are among spotlight topics at Moscow Conference on International Security and China-Russia back-to-back strategic coordination will grow stronger.""Most countries in the world support China over Pelosi's highly provocative visit to the island,"" Ding noted.According to Wang, more than 170 countries have spoken up for justice. ""They reiterated their one-China commitment and support for China's efforts to defend national sovereignty and territorial integrity,"" Wang said. ""China will continue to work with the international community to safeguard the purposes and principles of the UN Charter and to jointly maintain regional and global peace and stability,"" Wang said.",CHINA,DIPLOMACY,Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Wang Wenbin Photo: VCG,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'China': ('LOC', 12), 'Russia': ('LOC', 6), 'US': ('LOC', 3), 'Taiwan': ('LOC', 8), 'Ukraine': ('LOC', 1), 'Taiwan Straits': ('LOC', 9), 'Moscow': ('LOC', 1), 'Vladimir Putin': ('PER', 6), 'Nancy Pelosi': ('PER', 3), 'Wang Wenbin': ('PER', 5), 'Ding Xiaoxing': ('PER', 2), 'P': ('PER', 1), 'Din': ('PER', 1), 'House': ('ORG', 1), 'Foreign Ministry': ('ORG', 1), 'TASS': ('ORG', 1), 'Institute of Eurasian Studies': ('ORG', 1), 'China Institutes of Contemporary International Relations': ('ORG', 1), 'Tass': ('ORG', 1), 'Global Times': ('ORG', 1), 'UN': ('ORG', 1), '10th Moscow Conference on International Security': ('MISC', 2), 'Moscow Conference on International Security': ('MISC', 2), 'West': ('MISC', 1), 'Charter': ('MISC', 1)}"
27,"One year after Kabul debacle, US attempts to sustain hegemony at cost of the whole world",Global Times,2022-08-15,"One year ago, the US hastily and embarrassingly withdrew from Afghanistan. Now, the scene of that fiasco still lingers in many people's minds. But a year later, the US did not draw lessons from a war it had failed. What the world sees is since the Kabul moment, the US has been mobilizing its resources to target China and Russia at the cost of the whole world. US President Joe Biden delivered three speeches in April, July and August last year respectively on the US withdrawal from Afghanistan. Besides looking for a decent excuse for the disgraceful withdrawal, all the three speeches blatantly raised the true intent of the US - the US needs to focus on shoring up US's core strengths to meet the strategic competition with China, and Russia. In Ukraine, the US as the instigator of the Russia-Ukraine conflict keeps fanning the flames by providing weapons to Ukraine in a bid to deplete the strength of Russia, in disregard of the development of Ukraine and the wellbeing of the Ukraine people. Even the interests of US' EU allies were sacrificed by the US as a stepping stone to consolidate its global hegemony.With no end in sight of the Ukraine crisis, the US is trying to ignite another clash in Asia. After US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi visited Taiwan island on August 2, a delegation of five US lawmakers arrived on the island of Taiwan on Sunday. By provoking a conflict in the Taiwan Straits, the US is hoping to rally its resources in Asia, contain China's development, and undermine security in Asia.Now the US, a superpower in its downfall, can only retain its hegemony by creating confrontations and dragging a large number of countries into the muddy water. The US is no longer able to bring the world peace, stability and development, but only engages in messing around the world. Sun Xihui, an associate research fellow with the National Institute of International Strategy at the China Academy of Social Sciences, believes that provoking major powers like China and Russia is one means through which the US destabilizes the world, and sowing confrontation based on ideology is another.""The US divides the world with the so-called 'values.' On the one hand, it relentlessly labels countries that it deems could challenge the West order as 'autocracies,' and on the other hand, it tries hard to convince West countries and non-West countries which accept West values to buy such a view, thus intensifying division among the international community with this 'autocracy vs democracy' narrative. As the US brings about chaos, the deep anxiety over its hegemony and the order it once dominated is fully exposed,"" said Sun.According to Xu Liang, an associate professor at the School of International Relations of Beijing International Studies University, now the US is a ""sick man"" who is desperately looking for a therapy like a headless chicken, as if it could find its past health if the world is in chaos.""The US has found it hard to sustain its hegemony, as sustaining it is too costly for the US now. The US has passed its peak, with its withdrawal from Afghanistan marking the beginning of the decline of US strength. The impetuous moves of the US over Ukraine and Taiwan question prove that the US has fewer and fewer political options,"" said Xu.Xu noted that the logic behind US' actions to mess around the world is that as the US declines, the world can be exploited as expendable. The US only wants other countries to coordinate with its national interests to contain China and Russia, which, after all, is nothing but a fantasy.The US is still a global hegemon, but a discouraged one. From a short-term point of view, a discouraged hegemon can still generate momentary destruction, but from a long-term perspective, it will only consume all of its energy. It is a process in which US' influence declines and its reputation gets tainted.",OPINION,VIEWPOINT,Illustration: Chen Xia/GT,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'US': ('LOC', 18), 'Afghanistan': ('LOC', 2), 'Kabul': ('LOC', 1), 'China': ('LOC', 5), 'Russia': ('LOC', 5), 'Ukraine': ('LOC', 6), 'Asia': ('LOC', 3), 'Taiwan Straits': ('LOC', 3), 'West': ('LOC', 3), 'Joe Biden': ('PER', 1), 'Nancy Pelosi': ('PER', 1), 'Sun': ('PER', 1), 'EU': ('ORG', 1), 'US House': ('ORG', 1), 'Xi': ('ORG', 1), 'Institute': ('ORG', 1)}"
28,Chinese model will be part of mankind's legacy: German sociologist,Global Times,2022-08-16,"Editor's Note: For China people, the past decade has been epic and inspirational. The country, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping at the core, has made great endeavors in boosting its economy, deepening reforms, improving the rights of its people and acting as a responsible global power.Speaking about the vitality of China's governance model over the past decade and what lessons it can provide to other countries, Heinz Dieterich (Dieterich), a world-renowned sociologist and political analyst from Germany who first proposed the concept of ""21st century socialism,"" told Global Times reporters Yu Jincui and Bai Yunyi that China's model will be part of mankind's legacy and China is a mirror in which people can see China is a living example that a state can serve the public interests, while the US is a living example that acts only on behalf of the ruling power elites. This is the 18th article of the Global Times series about this special decade.Global Times: In terms of China's development over the past 10 years, which aspect of China has attracted most of your attention and why?  Dieterich: There are many positive developments like the overcoming of COVID-19 and the public health response from China, which has become a model for any responsible state on the global scale. Other important developments include overcoming poverty, which is also a new paradigm for the worldwide battle against poverty, the crackdown on corruption, and so on. But I think the most outstanding one is undoubtedly China's understanding, that the supposed ""value-driven foreign policy"" and ""rules-based international order"" were nothing more than propaganda memes for a passing historical phase of the relationship with West imperialist powers. President Xi Jinping is an outstanding scientist, visionary and responsible statesman and a consequent revolutionary. Since he became secretary general of the CPC Central Committee, he has attached great importance on the modernization of the armed forces, society, technology, and so on.Global Times: You once said that ""the CPC is a vanguard that has been genuinely responding to the needs of the people."" Under the leadership of President Xi Jinping in the past 10 years, how has this role of CPC been reflected in China's governance?Dieterich: All empirical evidence shows that my statement was absolutely correct. To mention only a few parameters. Very clearly in China you have the internal unity of the Party under the leadership of Xi Jinping. You have satisfaction of most social classes and social sectors, which is represented in the opinion polls on government popularity. You have the demonstration of the effect of the vanguard leadership in that there is a strong unity and an acceptance of the moral authority of the Party in these social classes, which have stood shoulder to shoulder with the government and Party through all recent crises, since the 2008 global capitalist-induced financial crisis, through COVID-19, the economic recovery, Ukraine crisis, Taiwan question, and so on. I don't think there's any way to refute what I said last year (in an interview with the Global Times) - and I'm glad as a scientist - that my prognosis was sound and has been proven now.Global Times: In your opinion, what's the biggest difference between the CPC governance and the US elite politics? Why have the US media and politicians kept smearing China's political system and attacking the China government as an ""authoritarian government"" that lacks ""democracy""?Dieterich: It's really laughable to call the China government an ""authoritarian government"" and pretend that there's any kind of sound democracy in the US and in any of these capitalist democracies.China is a mirror, in which the people of the world can see China is a living example that a state can serve the public interests, while the US is a living example of what you should not do in a democracy － neglecting the people's needs and only acting on behalf of the ruling elites. The main difference is that the US elites and the chrematistic market economic system they administer are driven by the pursuit of personal and corporate money and power interests, not the public or national goods.Since China demonstrably shows that governments can act in the public interests, not for corporate and private profit interests, it is a constant reminder that there is a strategic alternative for people to determine their own destiny. Thus, the whole ideological basis of the West's supposed ""liberal democratic world order"" implodes before facts and is revealed as fake news through a mega manipulation level of the masses.That's why EU foreign secretary Joseph Borrell says that the West is losing the ""global battle of narratives"" against China and Russia. The ""liberal world order"" is nothing more than a liberal perception management-code in order to manipulate the masses and occult the antidemocratic vertical structure of the US oligarchic system driven by a few power elites and a brutal dominant imperialist class.Global Times: Under the leadership of CPC, China is marching toward realizing its second centennial goal. What expectations do you have for China in the next 10 or more years?Dieterich: As long as China maintains the above-mentioned governance and leadership capabilities and requisites which have allowed it to overcome all crises in the last century, it will keep progressing like it has in the last 100 years. It will continue the successful drive of national rejuvenation and peaceful coexistence in a global system polycentric with centers including China, the US, Russia, EU and India. The only way that this development can become a problem is that if the US imperialist-led forces unleash nuclear war, either over Taiwan question or over Ukraine crisis. If we can avoid nuclear war, then China's development will follow the trajectory and orbit we have seen in the last over 70 years.

Heinz Dieterich Photo: Courtesy of Heinz DieterichGT: The noise of the ""China collapse"" theory can sometimes be heard across the world. Do you think China's political and economic model has vitality? Are you optimistic about China's future?Dieterich: In general, I am confident that the China model will be part of mankind´s legacy. The essential lesson that we must learn from China's model is that a transformational responsible vanguard in power must maintain an active, open, honest dialectical interaction among the Party, the state and the social classes, in order to avoid harmful elitist interests to prevail in governance.As long as the CPC maintains its anti-corruption tendency, understands that the West has many subversive ways to abort the successful socialist experiment in China, and is capable of combating and controlling such attempts, then China will go ahead with its great vision to realize socialist modernization by 2035 and build a great modern socialist China in all respects by 2050. Global Times: The West also fabricated the ""China threat"" theory, attempting to isolate China on the global scale. Can it achieve its intent?  Dieterich: No, I think the West is losing its attempt to smear China and to dominate the public minds of the people through its lines. You can see this very easily. They are in despair. Data show China will grow much stronger than the US. Economic development is an indicator of efficacy, future prosperity and so on. The development tendency has deranged those propaganda smears. You can also see that the US has failed to isolate Russia over the Ukraine war. The US has not managed to make Africa countries and Latin US countries join the attack on Russia. It has lost the political control of two major continents. This is a clear indicator that nobody believes West lies about China and Russia anymore. That's what makes them even more aggressive and dangerous, because they will become more hysterical. Global Times: What do you think of the relationship between China and Latin US in the past 10 years? US politicians often portray China's normal economic and trade activities in Latin US as expanding its sphere of influence. How much impact does this kind of smear have on China-Latin US relations?Dieterich: Very little. The Latin US political class essentially knows that it is a lie and ideological aggression. Thus, they don´t take it seriously. The continuously growing China investments and cultural interaction activities between Latin US countries and China are a clear indicator. All Latin US governments need investment. They need good financial terms for development. The US has no money to help the Latin US states. China and the New Development Bank （previously known as the BRICS Development Bank） and so on have strategic global economic development plans. But West powers have no strategic ideas for the world. That is what the Latin US leaders have noticed. There is no money for them. There is only fake propaganda. The US cannot turn the clock back. The domination of the US century is over. Latin US's resistance to joining the US-EU imperialist aggression and sanctions against Russia is a very clear indication of this. And the same holds true for Africa and the Middle East, among other areas. Bai Qinling contributed to this article.",OPINION,VIEWPOINT,"Flower decorations along Chang'an Avenue in Beijing, June, 2021.

30,Unorthodox US macro policy casts shadows on world recovery,Wang Yi,2022-08-16,"International crude oil price continued to drop on Monday, with US' West Texas Intermediate oil futures slipping to $86.82 a barrel, its lowest level since early February just before the outbreak of Russia-Ukraine conflict. However, the US Post said ""China's surprise rate cut, economic slowdown send oil prices plunging.""As the world's largest oil importer consuming 15 percent of the world's oil, China's demand fluctuations have a certain impact on oil prices, but the severe turbulence in oil prices this year is more of the consequence of a series of complicated factors including geopolitical conflicts, the US-led economic sanctions against Russia, weak economic performance in EU and the US, as well as the irregular movement of the US dollar.After China released its economic data for July on Monday, some West media outlets launched another round of badmouthing targeting China's economy, trying to blame the pressure on the global gloom and the decline of oil prices on China, which has long been a stabilizer and a major contributor of economic growth.It is of outright nonsense to use a decline in oil prices to slander China's economy. The China economy has maintained strong growth rates for many years, and after the central bank cut interest rates to propel quick growth after the pandemic hit, the economy has been reignited. Admittedly, some indicators showed that the slower-than-expected pace of expansion in certain areas in China's economy last month suggested headwinds linked to global uncertainty and sporadic COVID-19 flare-ups. When looking at China's economic outlook, the outside world should return to gauging the fundamentals, which remains solid.Now the international oil prices are returning to the level of months ago, which is definitely conducive to growth of China's economy in the second half of the year. Analysts said that low oil prices will help China's manufacturing industry to reduce costs and improve profit margins, and it will also have a positive stimulating effect on demand for consumption and tourism.In contrast, the bleak US economy and the deep-rooted dilemma of US central bank' macroeconomic policy is shadowing the global economy, which should arouse more concern.The US economy contracted in the first and second quarters of 2022, fueling an ongoing debate about whether the country is already in or about to slip into a recession. An increasing number of investors believe that the US has entered a recession, and the dilemma between the Fed's response to deal with inflation and recession is for everyone to see. Though West think tanks are vigorously defending the US economy, claiming it is unlikely to have a hard landing and there are still reasons to be optimistic, it is undeniable that the US economy and the country's irresponsible macro policies are the biggest risk to the global economy.More significantly, given the important position of the US economy and the dollar in the global economic and financial system, once the US economy falls into recession, it will create negative spillover effects and dampen the global economic outlook. As the most important commodity in the world, the oil price is not only an important indicator for the financial market, but also has a certain influence on the future direction of the global economy. While there is no easy answer to the question of how a fall in oil prices will affect the world economy, if the oil supply and demand balance cannot be restored and prices cannot stabilize, it will continue to shortcut the global economy.The International Monetary Fund in late July downgraded the global economic growth forecast to 2.3 percent. Facing an increasing uncertain future, all major economies should take a responsible attitude and work together to shore up the global economy instead of playing geopolitical games and intentionally erecting more barriers to harm cooperation. The author is an editor with the Global Times. bizopinion@globaltimes.com.cn",SOURCE,ECONOMY,Illustration: Chen Xia/Global Times,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'US': ('LOC', 7), 'Texas': ('LOC', 1), 'Russia': ('LOC', 2), 'Ukraine': ('LOC', 1), 'China': ('LOC', 11), 'West': ('MISC', 2), 'COD': ('MISC', 1), 'US Post': ('ORG', 1), 'EU': ('ORG', 1)}"
31,China's recent white paper on Taiwan question must be read by Americans who do not want war,Franz Gayl,2022-08-15,"Following US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's provocative trip to the Taiwan island, another US congressional delegation landed on the island on Sunday on an unannounced two-day visit.The US and Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) drums pound louder to incite further provocation against One China principle. DPP-allied neoconservatives dominate President Joe Biden's national security state and Congress. Their frenzied, media-amplified calls to fight China conveniently mask US debacles including the Afghanistan withdrawal and the US' role in the Ukraine conflict.The Doomsday Clock metric shows just over a minute remaining before a nuclear holocaust is triggered in EU or the Indo-Pacific.  US still have time to read China's White Paper titled ""The Taiwan Question and China's Reunification in the New Era"" to change course.Readers will come to appreciate the seriousness of China's statement that Taiwan is part of China. They will also comprehend China's iron resolve to reunify one China, a non- negotiable objective that will be achieved, in a process that cannot be halted.Since its founding, the China has reliably fulfilled its promises on core priorities. This consistency unnerves the US neocon and DPP coconspirators. In denial, they falsify history and give lip service to the international order, its laws and rules, all while violating them.The historical record that Taiwan is part of China is unarguable. Archeological and historical records show that Taiwan has belonged to China continuously since AD 230 when the earliest references of Taiwan are to be found, among others, in Seaboard Geographic Gazetteer compiled by Shen Ying of the State of Wu Weishan during the Three Kingdoms Period.Europeans attempted to colonize Taiwan but were expelled by the Qing Dynasty in 1662. In 1885 the Qing Dynasty established the Province of Taiwan. In 1894 Japan defeated China and forced it to cede the island to Japan occupiers. The US fought alongside its ally China in their war against Japan, seeking China's win over Japan and its recovery of Taiwan. Taiwan's status as a part of China is enshrined in international law. The Cairo Declaration signed by China, the US, and the United Kingdom in 1943 stated that all territories Japan had stolen from China, including Taiwan, should be restored to China. The Potsdam Proclamation signed by the same parties in 1945 stated that the terms of the Cairo Declaration shall be carried out. In 1945, Japan signed the instrument of surrender and in it promised to faithfully fulfill the obligations of the Potsdam Proclamation.After China resumed sovereignty over Taiwan, a civil war pitted the Republic of China (ROC) Kuomintang (KMT) against the Communist Party of China (CPC). Both contended to rule all China, encompassing the mainland and Taiwan island. After being tactically defeated, the KMT retreated to the island pausing the war pending final reunification.In 1949, the China (PRC) was founded. US displeasure with the CPC prompted it to militarily shield the exiled KMT in the hope the US-allied ROC would someday reunify China by reconquering the mainland. The legitimacy of US efforts collapsed in 1971 when the UN ejected the KMT-ruled ROC and seated the PRC as the sole legal representative of the whole China. Emboldened by US military assurances, the Taiwan authorities, continued its cross Straits political confrontation, but the territorial definition and integrity of One China was never in doubt.The UN reinforced PRC legal sovereignty over the island in a later resolution stating that ""Taiwan, Province of China"" is the island's only internationally recognized status. PRC-averse US politicians artificially carved out a separate military relationship with China's Taiwan island violating China's sovereignty and skirting international law. The US hoped the KMT would someday defeat the PRC, but it became clear that vision was unrealistic. In the 1980s, US subtle machinations gave rise to the DPP secessionist party with an independence platform the China-averse US politicians embraced.Since the 1980s, the DPP and US neocons have strived in vain to rewrite history and dismiss international law. They also hang their hats on an invalidated Treaty of San Francisco that asserts Taiwan island's status is not determined. By disregarding UN resolutions, and the Cairo and Potsdam Proclamations, the US continues to flout codified international law. This irrational attachment to a false history reflects desperate DPP and neocon ambitions that will be crushed when reunification inevitably occurs.The cross-Straits crisis and Russia-Ukraine dilemma are fundamentally different. But they do have one feature in common, namely US meddling that discourages peaceful negotiations and outcomes only to benefit continued US hegemony and increase arms merchant profits.With one minute left on the Doomsday Clock, there may be time to caution a few key US decision makers. If they read China's recent White Paper, perhaps they can view DPP and neocon rhetoric with a jaundiced eye, and extinguish the fuse they lit that otherwise will explode in war.The author is a retired Marine Corps infantry officer and a former Pentagon employee.

32,Pelosi's sneaky visit to Taiwan makes ASEAN countries firmer on one-China,Herman Tiu Laurel,2022-08-15,"The stunt - US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's visit to Taiwan - was the latest US move in ""creeping separatism promotion"" involving a series of increasingly higher-level US political visits to the island, even as the government of the China mainland has correspondingly heightened its objections to the visits. While the Joe Biden administration disowned the Pelosi visit, this was belied by Pelosi's use of US military planes, thus exposing once again the treacherous US policy of ""strategic ambiguity.""The Philippines, as did ASEAN and the rest of the World, watched the Pelosi-Taiwan tragicomedy unfold while international mainstream and social media followed the flight of Pelosi, which skirted the China Sea and landed in Taipei like a thief in the night. It skipped the Philippines, which many Filipinos believe is an affirmation of the country's neutrality on the issue.When Pelosi ended her comedy and departed, China's People's Liberation Army (PLA) conducted spectacular and well-planned ""military drills"" that shook the US. These exercises demonstrated to the world that, 27 years after the 1995 Taiwan Straits crisis when the US had paraded its carrier groups through and around the Taiwan Straits with impunity, China's PLA now fully controls its entire territory and is just waiting to complete peaceful reunificationChina's military drills were a communications masterpiece. They completely isolated the island of Taiwan without disturbing anyone else, exhibited its missile capabilities without hurting anything, and challenged the US without taunting. It then escalated the message by cutting off key dialogues and cooperation initiatives with the US. US State Secretary Antony Blinken was forced to call quickly for ""de-escalation."" China mainland held back a number of Taiwan exports, reminding the island's separatists where its prosperity lies.Watching from the Philippines, I was so thrilled by the PRC's ""winning the war without fighting"" that I penned a column in the Philippine News Agency, an official government information platform, entitled ""US forever wars ends with the Pelosi-Tsai stunt."" China and the PLA had effectively shown it cannot lose an Asia war that the US may want to initiate and in the process edging up by many notches the certainty of the peaceful re-integration of Taiwan and ensuring peace in the region.The UN re-affirmed its support for the one-China policy in the midst of the tensions. When confronted by the media, the Philippines likewise reiterated its view of the country's one-China policy. Ms. Clarita Carlos, National Security Adviser to President Ferdinand ""Bongbong"" Marcos Jr., reaffirmed  that ""now, we are subscribing to what we call a one-China policy which means there's only one China and Taiwan is its province...""ASEAN is also solidly behind the one-China policy as evidenced by the expanding projects of friendship and cooperation between China and ASEAN countries that is part of the ASEAN-China Comprehensive Strategic Partnership that was forged in 2021. The Pelosi stunt has left ASEAN members upset with the reckless adventurism of the US.Feedback from US media shows that recriminations have been flying against Pelosi inside US; NYT columnist Thomas L. Friedman calls her visit to Taiwan ""utterly reckless."" CNN says ""Questions mount over whether Pelosi's Taiwan trip is worth the consequences."" And the Financial Times reported that ""US allies rattled by China's aggressive response to Nancy Pelosi's Taiwan visit."" It is clear that the West has been given by China some food for serious thought.As the reverberations of Pelosi's Taiwan visit settle down, the Philippines needs to do much sober thinking. The US has just shown that it will likely just stand by and watch if and when the PLA blockades Taiwan. Of course, the world has already seen how quickly the US abandoned its Afghan allies when the crunch time came. And the reality of US commitment is also evident in Ukraine, as it is prepared to fight the war to the last drop of Ukraine blood.It is amusing to note the August 11, 2022 report of the Chicago Council on Global Affairs entitled ""US Favor Aiding Taiwan with Arms but Not Troops,"" which clearly shows the cynical utilitarianism of US campaign for ""democracy."" And of course, in the new book Chaos Under Heaven, author Josh Rogin quotes Donald Trump, ""Taiwan is like two feet away from China... We are eight thousand miles away. If they invade, there isn't a fucking thing we can do about it.""The Pelosi-Taiwan stunt heightens this question to Filipinos, ""Can the Philippines rely on US security guarantees in its Military Defense Treaty (MDT)."" For that matter, can US allies Japan and South Korea rely on the US commitments? And can ASEAN continue to allow the provocative interference of the US in Asia-Pacific affairs? These are timely and realistic questions that all of US in Asia need to ponder, thanks to the Pelosi faux pas. The author is the founder of Philippine-BRICS strategic Studies, a Philippine think tank, and writer-columnist of SovereignPH.com and the Philippine News Agency news site, broadcast and online political-economic host and commentator. opinion@globaltimes.com.cn",OPINION,VIEWPOINT,Illustration: Liu Rui/GT,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'US House': ('ORG', 1), 'ASEAN': ('ORG', 1), ""People ' s Liberation Army"": ('ORG', 1), 'PLA': ('ORG', 2), 'PLAhin': ('ORG', 1), 'Agency': ('ORG', 1), 'Psi': ('ORG', 1), 'UN': ('ORG', 1), 'Nancy Pelosi': ('PER', 6), 'Joe Biden': ('PER', 1), 'Antony Blinken': ('PER', 1), 'Taiwan': ('LOC', 5), 'US': ('LOC', 11), 'China': ('LOC', 5), 'Philippines': ('LOC', 2), 'World': ('LOC', 1), 'China Sea': ('LOC', 6), 'Taipei': ('LOC', 1), 'Taiwan Straits': ('LOC', 7), 'PhilippinesC': ('LOC', 1), 'Asia': ('LOC', 1), 'Filipino': ('MISC', 1), 'Philippine': ('MISC', 1)}"
33,India expected to maintain 'strategic independence' on 75th independence day despite 'shared values' preached by Biden,GT staff reporters,2022-08-15,"India on Monday celebrated 75 years of independence, with Prime Minister Narendra Modi speaking about the developments and challenges the country has faced in his ninth consecutive Independence Day speech, and even though US President Joe Biden keenly called India an ""indispensable partner"" in a congratulatory message and stressed ""democracy,"" analysts noted that India will not easily alter its current policy on ""diplomatic independence,"" as it has brought flexibility and benefits to the country. August 15 marked the 75th anniversary of the end of UK colonial rule over India in 1947. Modi led the celebrations from Red Fort in New Delhi and addressed the nation by saying that it was a historic day for India as it takes a new path with a new resolve. The India leader also credited India as being the mother of democracy and talked about various developments in the country as well as challenges during the past 75 years, India media reported. Indians have been celebrating the anniversary for days, with many expressing hope that the country will become a developed country in the near future. India's first indigenously built aircraft carrier Vikrant was reportedly commissioned on Monday to celebrate the occasion. On Sunday, US President Joe Biden congratulated India on its 75 years of independence and said the US and India were ""indispensable partners"" that would continue to work together to address global challenges in the years ahead, and that the US-India Strategic Partnership is based on ""shared commitment to the rule of law and the promotion of human freedom and dignity,"" Reuters reported. Joe Biden's congratulatory message showed that the US has attached more importance to relations with India, given its strategic position in the US' Indo-Pacific Strategy and US plans to counter China, Qian Feng, director of the research department at the National Strategy Institute at Tsinghua University, told the Global Times. By stressing the ""shared"" values on ""democracy"" between India and the US, Joe Biden wants to draw India over to its side and also to put China, Russia or other US adversaries on the opposite side as ""authoritarian states,"" Qian said. However, the US that has previously criticized India for its policies toward Muslims and on other human rights issues.For example, the US State Department releases annual reports on different countries' human rights situations, in which they always criticize India over issues including ""unlawful and arbitrary killing."" In April, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said that the US ""is monitoring"" what he described as a rise in human rights abuses in India. In response, India External Affairs Minister Dr S Jaishankar gave a strong rebuttal to the US criticism and said New Delhi has concerns about human rights in US.The US' rhetoric on shared ""values"" and ""democracy"" with India is based on its own geopolitical needs, which India has seen through, said Qian, noting that although the Modi government hopes to have closer relations with the West, it will not abandon its practical diplomatic approach of maintaining strategic independence, as this policy gives India more diplomatic room and flexibility.The benefits of maintaining a strategic balance have been demonstrated in the way India is dealing with the Ukraine crisis, analysts said, noting that despite facing increasing pressure from the US and the West, India has maintained relations with Russia, ensuring both imports of energy from Russia and greater global influence. Qian noted that India also wants to keep a balance between China and the US to maximize its own interests in the region, which is why it has actively joined the Shanghai Cooperation Organization and other regional organizations with China and is also in the Quad, a framework made up of the US, Japan, India and Australia, which is seen as an effort to contain China. India's aim is to highlight its unique presence as a littoral state in the India Ocean. As China is India's neighbor, better bilateral relations will bring benefits to both countries, analysts said, warning that India should also work with China to go in the same direction and urging it to choose a pragmatic policy toward China on sensitive issues, especially the Taiwan question and US-India cooperation. At a media briefing on Saturday, China Ambassador to India Sun Weidong said that India and China are seeing a ""positive impetus"" and called on India to stick to the one-China principle, after India External Affairs Ministry spokesperson Arindam Bagchi said on Friday that India's policies on the principle are ""well-known and consistent"" - the first comment from the India government over US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's provocative visit to the island of Taiwan.",CHINA,DIPLOMACY,"US, India Illustration: Chen Xia/GT",Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'India': ('LOC', 16), 'US': ('LOC', 12), 'UK': ('LOC', 1), 'Red Fort': ('LOC', 1), 'New Delhi': ('LOC', 1), 'China': ('LOC', 2), 'B': ('LOC', 2), 'Russia': ('LOC', 1), 'Narendra Modi': ('PER', 2), 'Joe Biden': ('PER', 4), 'Qian Feng': ('PER', 1), 'Antony': ('PER', 1), 'Independence Day': ('MISC', 1), 'Indians': ('MISC', 1), 'Vikrant': ('MISC', 1), 'India Strategic Partnership': ('MISC', 1), 'Indo - Pacific Strategy': ('MISC', 1), 'Muslims': ('MISC', 1), 'Reuters': ('ORG', 1), 'National Strategy Institute': ('ORG', 1), 'Tsinghua University': ('ORG', 1), 'Global Times': ('ORG', 1), 'Department': ('ORG', 1)}"
34,Title not found,GT staff reporters,2022-08-15,"
Japan politicians' worship of the controversial Yasukuni Shrine on the 77th anniversary of Japan's unconditional surrender in World War II has sent waves of anger across neighboring countries, which lodged stern representations and called on Tokyo to squarely face history. As it was the first anniversary marked by the new Japan prime minister, it was closely watched by Asia countries, said experts. However, to their dismay, they only saw a militaristic Japan careening more to the right and with more twisted historical views. Experts noted that a Japan that sticks to historical revisionism will continue to be viewed as ""non grata"" by its neighboring countries, and its ties with those countries are unlikely to be mended. Instead of reflecting on its own wrongdoings, Japan is going astray by seeking to revise its pacifist constitution and boosting its military expenditure, and also tagging along with the US to create more threats for regional security, said experts, who urged Japan to be cautious and not become the ""guilty person of Asia"" again.Japan Prime Minister Fumio Kishida on Monday sent an offering to the Yasukuni Shrine, which enshrines Japan's infamous Class-A war criminals who symbolized Japan's war atrocities and militarism during World War II. ""We will never again repeat the horrors of war. I will continue to live up to this determined oath,"" Kishida told a secular gathering in Tokyo on Monday. However, his speech largely focused on the damage Japan suffered on its own territory, and did not mention Japan's aggression across Asia in the first half of the 20th century or the victims in the region, the Associated Press reported. Two cabinet ministers - Economic Security Minister Takaichi Sanae and Reconstruction Minister Akiba Kenya - visited the shrine on Monday, NHK reported. Both the China Foreign Ministry and the China Embassy in Japan sternly criticized the Japan politicians' actions.Wang Wenbin, spokesperson of the China Foreign Ministry, said at a Monday briefing that the shrine is a spiritual symbol of the Japan military's aggression against other countries, and that the Japan politicians' visit reflected Japan's wrong attitude toward history. China has already lodged solemn representations to Japan via diplomatic channels and expressed our position, said Wang. Those who backpedal against history will eventually go astray, said Wang. In response to Japan politicians' visit to the infamous shrine, a spokesperson from the China Embassy in Japan said on Monday that Japan must recognize and reflect on its own history of invasion and draw a clear line with militarism so as to gain trust from its Asia neighbors as well as the international community. 

August 15 marks the 77th anniversary of Japan's unconditional surrender in World War II. This is a day to remember history. People visit the exhibition showcasing the glorious course of CPC's victory at the China People's Anti-Japan Aggression War Memorial Hall in Beijing.

It also strongly urged the leaders of Japan to squarely face history and demonstrate through actions their humble reflection and sincere remorse for Japan's past actions, the Xinhua News Agency reported. August 15 was marked by South Korea as National Liberation Day to mark the anniversary of the Korean Peninsula's liberation from the 1910-45 Japan colonial rule. This year is the first time the anniversary of Japan's unconditional surrender in World War II has been marked since Kishida took office, so other Asia countries are watching, especially when rising right-wing forces in Japan are pushing the country into militarism, Lü Chao, an expert on Korean Peninsula issues at the Liaoning Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times on Monday. It is worth noting that Japan media reported Kishida sent an offering to the shrine in his capacity as leader of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), and such a sneaky move aims to avoid further angering surrounding countries, as a visit to the shrine by the Japan prime minister would escalate diplomatic frictions, and also caters to the ring-wing forces within the LDP, Liu Jiangyong, vice dean of the Institute of Modern International Relations at Tsinghua University, told the Global Times. He noted that playing such tricks shows Kishida is also sticking close to the right-wing forces, and exposes the dangerous trend of Japan's views on its war history. Based on Japan's history of invading neighboring countries, either glorifying the war or refusing to admit the war was an act of provocation and it will surely trigger other Asia countries' antipathy toward it, Lü siad.   South Korea President Yoon Suk-yeol described Tokyo on Monday as a partner in tackling global challenges and said the two nations must overcome disputes dating back to the colonial era, Reuters reported.Yoon has repeatedly signaled a wish to improve ties with Japan since he took office in May, and the two countries have been holding talks to resolve historical disputes but ended up making little progress, said Lü. Japan's twisted historical views that still treat South Korea and other countries as its colonies, as well as Japan politicians' reluctance to recognize its war atrocities, won't help improve its ties with other Asia countries, Lü noted. According to reports last week, Seishiro Eto, former deputy speaker of Japan's House of Representatives and a lawmaker of the Liberal Democratic Party, recently said, ""Japan once colonized South Korea. In a sense, Japan is like an older brother to Korea"", and he added, ""I don't think the Japan-Korea relationship is equal. Japan should take a leadership position."" Backpedaling against peace Observers said that in addition to sticking to denying the past, Japan is now treading on a more dangerous path of reviving its militarism, with Tokyo speeding up boosting its defense budget and amending its pacifist constitution. It is also serving as a vassal of the US, as well as provoking China on issues including the Taiwan question. In June, when attending a summit of the NATO in Spain, Kishida said Japan intends to upgrade its partnership with NATO significantly, citing excuse of Ukraine crisis, noting that the security of EU is inseparable from that of Asia, media reported.This revealed Japan's strategy of bringing non-regional countries into regional affairs, which is a dangerous trend, as the arrival of extraterritorial forces will easily tear apart the cooperation mechanism of regional countries, thus creating antagonism, a professor from the Institute of International Relations at the China Foreign Affairs University in Beijing, who preferred not to be named, told the Global Times on Monday. Japan has bungled its diplomatic ties with surrounding countries, partly because it hurt their feelings by sticking to historical revisionism, and also because Tokyo, by hyping up threats in the region, seeks to revise its pacifist constitution and conduct military activities, said the expert, noting that Japan's move has deviated from the development track of ""peaceful countries,"" and seeks to become a ""country that can fight a war.""For Asia countries, Japan's tendency will fuel an arms race in the region and create more obstacles for regional stability, said the expert, urging Japan not to become the ""guilty person of Asia"" again.",CHINA,DIPLOMACY,"Representatives of descendants of the survivors of the Nanjing Massacre strike the Peace Bell with local students at the Memorial Hall of the Victims of the Nanjing Massacre by the Japanese Invaders in Nanjing, East China's Jiangsu Province.

35,Washington has only itself to blame for growing de-dollarization trend,Wen Sheng,2022-08-14,"After the breakout of the Russia-Ukraine conflict early this year, US-led West governments imposed a raft of sweeping financial sanctions on Moscow including freezing its foreign exchange reserves. The thought the US may move to grab anybody's assets who refuses to obey US's dictates is truly unnerving, which is now inducing more countries to diversify their reserve assets away from US dollars. There exists another important factor driving more countries to push for a quicker pace of de-dollarization. The US Federal Reserve, led by egoism, only cares for US's and Wall Street investors' interests, and the US central bank has in the past years frequently bungled on its monetary policy, creating cyclical liquidity ups and downs, and inflationary crises - like the current wave of over 8.5 percent inflation unseen in 40 years. Steep and incessant hikes of US's interest rates by the Fed inevitably has sparked an exodus of capital from the developing countries, which often leads to foreign debt defaults and implosion of many emerging market economies. Over the past decades, the world has witnessed many such economies - including Mexico, Argentina, Thailand, South Korea, Greece, Turkey and Sri Lanka - running into serious economic trouble because of the dollar-centric global financial system.In recent years with the increased weaponization of the dollar and US's penchant to use the dollar to sanction the so-called ""unruly"" countries in US's eyes, many countries in the world have awakened and begun to experiment trading in their own national currencies and using other payment as well trade settlement systems other than the SWIFT code (Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication), which is largely at the disposal of the US government.Since the 2008-09 global financial crisis which originated in the US, and quickly escalated into a global catastrophe, caused an economic tsunami pummeling all the countries and regions, more governments and central banks are exploring paths to break away from the dollar settlement and payment system, however, they have largely failed to make any headway to dent the dollar's global dominating position.But this time, Russia wants to do something different, as Moscow is determined to launch a counter-offensive against West sanctions and the dollar-centric global financial system. Angered by the unprecedented the West financial and economic sanctions, Moscow asked all ""unfriendly countries"" that are imposing sanctions on it to pay for their fuel purchases in Russia's rubles. The brave measure, Russia economists say, immediately helped stabilize the value of the ruble and significantly defuse the negative impact of the West sanctions. In addition to crude oil and natural gas, some of the economists have suggested Moscow extend the requirement for importers of Russia's grain, chemical fertilizers and other big-ticket products to transact in rubles, instead of dollars or euros. Russia's highly daring and innovative move to stabilize its own currency in time of difficulty has greatly incentivized other governments to follow suit. Now, there are media reports saying the BRICS countries are seeking to discuss deepening trade in their own currencies. For example, the R5 initiative has been proposed, targeting the use of the respective national currencies of BRICS - ruble (Russia), rupee (India), rand (South Africa), real (Brazil) and renminbi (China), to help settle trade among themselves.Therefore, the unprecedented West sanctions imposed on Russia, including restrictions on its central bank, now increasingly threaten to dilute the dominance of the US dollar and may result in a more fragmented international monetary system. To date, Moscow has almost entirely sold off its US bonds, and lately, there are growing signs that the world's other major economies begin to dump US Treasuries and other dollar-denominated US assets. The significance of Moscow's de-dollarization drive is that it is the most radical of de-dollarization measures taken by a sovereign nation. Russia has not only implemented de-dollarization measures domestically, but is also taking some tough measures in testing its own financial information exchange system. Actually, US has only itself to blame. In the recent years, US politicians, jittery about the economic rise of China and other emerging market economies, have deliberately created economic decoupling, technological blockades and industrial chain disruptions, in order to thwart economic growth of its competitors. It is natural for other countries to take decisive counter measures, including dumping dollar assets and departing the US stock market. And, given that the US has been aggressively using deficit financing to combat the economic ravages of COVID-19 pandemic, the sustainability of its debt might be called into question too. The share of the US dollar assets among the foreign exchange reserves of global central banks dropped to 59 percent in the fourth quarter of 2020 - a 25-year low, driven by central bank actions and exchange rate fluctuations, the IMF reported last May. The share further dropped to 58.88 percent in first quarter of 2022, IMF data showed.Since the US is stubbornly tethered to impeding and hurting other economies, its competitors have no obligations to embrace the outdated Bretton Woods system and help the US maintain the dollar hegemony. The dollar's decades-long dominance has placed US in a strong position to dictate the terms of global trade and finance for the last 70 years. It's high time for a change.The author is an editor with the Global Times. bizopinion@globaltimes.com.cn",SOURCE,ECONOMY,Illustration: Chen Xia/Global Times,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'Russia': ('LOC', 2), 'Ukraine': ('LOC', 1), 'US': ('LOC', 11), 'West': ('LOC', 3), 'Moscow': ('LOC', 3), 'Wall Street': ('LOC', 1), 'Mexico': ('LOC', 1), 'Argentina': ('LOC', 1), 'Thailand': ('LOC', 1), 'South Korea': ('LOC', 1), 'Greece': ('LOC', 1), 'Turkey': ('LOC', 1), 'Sri Lanka': ('LOC', 1), 'US Federal Reserve': ('ORG', 1), 'Fed': ('ORG', 1), 'Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication': ('ORG', 1), 'SWI': ('MISC', 1)}"
36,Past decade shows China's capacity to adjust to the changing circumstances: former Slovenian president,Global Times,2022-08-14,"Editor's Note: During the past decade, the world has increasingly witnessed a trend of ""the East is rising, and the West is declining"" in the spheres of economy, security and discourse power. West countries, particularly the US, plagued by internal woes, have sought the old path of passing the buck and instigating turmoil elsewhere to ease their own pressure. China, representative of the emerging countries, is proposing new solutions to global problems. By advocating win-win development, facilitating consultation and reconciliation and proposing a balanced and effective security mechanism, China is striving to build a community with a shared future for mankind.In the 10th piece of the series, Danilo Türk (Türk), former president of Slovenia, told Global Times (Global Times) reporter Lu Yuanzhi that over the last decade, China has shown, once again, its ability to adjust to changing circumstances. He noted that the most impressive feature of the past decade is the resilience and determination of the people of China to strive toward new levels of development.Global Times: You have visited China for several times. How do you see China's changes over the last decade? What role has the Communist Party of China (CPC) leadership played in it?Türk: The last decade was very dynamic. For China this was a decade of important achievements such as the eradication of extreme poverty and becoming one of the technologically most advanced powers with the possibility of achieving a leading role in technology in the next decade. In a historically uniquely short period it has moved from being ""the factory of the world"" to a technological leader and a source of new visions - such as the vision of ""a new era of eco-civilization."" At the same time China has shown, once again, its ability to adjust to the changing circumstances. The concepts and practices of ""dual circulation"" and ""common prosperity"" demonstrate the capacity to adjust. The resilience and determination of the people of China to strive toward new levels of development is the most impressive feature for a foreign observer like me. Clearly, this requires strong leadership that CPC has provided. It is impressive to hear, from President Xi Jinping and from CPC, the continued emphasis on the importance of innovation. Indeed, innovation is the key to progress toward new levels - not only in technology, but in economy and socio-political development as well. Global Times: President Xi Jinping proposed the Global Security Initiative this year and Global Development Initiative last year. What is your view on the significance of China's solution for global governance?Türk: Each of these two initiatives provides an important conceptual framework for the future. Now, they have to be followed up by more detailed projects. They can be many and quite diverse. Let me offer two examples. In the sphere of economic and social development, new ways have to be found to solve the growing debt crisis affecting a large number of developing countries and, in parallel, new models of partnership between public and private creditors to bolster investment in defense of global public goods, in particular global climate. China is a major player in global finance. Institutions like the IMF and the World Bank will have to be given new mandates and groupings like the Paris Club of creditors have to be reformed. This kind of tasks should be part of the implementation of the Global Development Initiative. Another major area is global action for eradication of extreme poverty and for social improvement in general. The preparation of the World Summit on Social Development in 2025 that was proposed by the UN Secretary-General will provide an opportunity for action in that regard.The Global Security Initiative, on the other hand, will have to contribute to revival of the global security system with the UN at its center. Right now the world is moving toward a dangerous fragmentation of the global security landscape. Exclusive security arrangements such as NATO can be helpful to global security but only if they function within a globally established balance of power and within international law. International security cannot be based on exclusive clubs alone. Global security is indivisible. For the global peace to be preserved, the UN - the only inclusive global organization must be given a proper role. Global Times: Over the past decade, how has China influenced the global order? What contributions will China make in the future?Türk: China's influence in the past decade has been significant. China played an important role in overcoming the global financial crisis that started in 2007 and lasted for a number of years. In that situation, China's role within the G20 was critical for success. China also played an important role in the preparation of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change in 2015 and to the consensus, within the UN, on Sustainable Development Goals in the same year. These are a few examples of China's positive role in the global order. The future is more difficult to predict. Right now the world is characterized by competition and confrontation rather than by cooperation. China can make a critically important contribution in finding a better balance between competition that is likely to remain strong and cooperation that is necessary and has to be strengthened. Today, the world needs a breather - and serious moves toward relaxation of tensions, a new generation of détente among the major powers. From the second half of the last century we know that the period of détente enabled the most significant progress. The leaders of today know well what détente requires. China, for her part, can help in guiding the political processes of the world towards a shared and better future for all.Global Times: When China President Xi Jinping in May exchanged congratulatory messages with Slovenian President Borut Pahor to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic ties between the two countries, President Pahor said as a member of the EU, Slovenia actively supports the strengthening of EU-China relations. But noticeably there are some voices in EU calling the continent to decouple with China, and to join the US in countering China. What do you think of such voices? Are you optimistic about the future of China-EU ties?Türk: Decoupling is an undesirable phenomenon. But it is also complex. There are serious analyses suggesting that ""coupling and decoupling"" in the economic cooperation has been going on for years and that both the EU and China have been doing both. But it is true that both China and the EU need a good framework of cooperation. The Comprehensive Agreement on Investment, approved in principle at the end of 2020, is such a framework. Regrettably, the subsequent EU sanctions and China's retaliation have put that agreement ""on ice."" I believe that leaders on both side should gradually reduce and eventually phase out the measures that harm both and that they should revive the agreement. In the same spirit, I think that it would be wise if the US decided to remove some of its tariffs imposed during Donald Trump's ""trade war on China.""  In short, I cannot be optimistic at present. But I believe that there are better ways forward. They include careful reflection now and effective confidence building in the near future. Reduction and eventual phasing out of restrictions imposed in the past years would be good confidence building measures.

Danilo Türk Photo: Courtesy of Türk Global Times: EU is hitting by high inflation. What's your take on EU becoming a major victim of the Ukraine crisis? What kind of challenge do you think EU is undergoing?Türk: Signs of inflation were visible already toward the end of 2021, before the outbreak of the current phase of the armed conflict in Ukraine. While it is true that the war and subsequent sanctions have made the situation worse, it would be inaccurate to say that inflation is a consequence of Ukraine crisis. Inflation is largely a result of expansionary monetary and fiscal policies needed to prevent the severe economic consequences that would otherwise follow COVID-19 lockdowns. What is particularly disturbing now is the fact that inflation is exacerbated by a cascade of crises - food, energy, public debt. These crises are affecting the whole world. EU finds itself in a very sensitive situation. EU countries have not had high inflation for more than a decade, in some cases for a number of decades. And the response of the EU Central Bank came late. This creates problems beyond finance and economics. From history we know that high inflation has corrosive effects on societies. It affects the social fabric and brings political instability. Now, all EU countries have to do their utmost to tame inflation and to do it quickly. The EU will have a major role to play. At the same time a more effective way to address the Ukraine crisis will have to be worked out. Global Times: It is reported in June that you participated in signing an open letter, urging the new Slovenian government to ""take a sensible stance on the war in Ukraine"" that would lead to Ukraine and Russia engaging in ""serious peace talks."" Why did you sign such an open letter? What kind of position do you think is ""sensible?""Türk: The critical question is how to stop the war. That will require a great deal of realism and courage, in other words ""a sensible stance."" At present, the devastation continues and no meaningful initiatives to stop the war seem to exist. EU seems completely dominated by its practice of sanctions - an approach that can cause a lot of damage, including in particular for the EU, but contributes little to solving the crisis. Therefore, the current approach has to be broadened and should include a vision of cessation of hostilities and subsequent peace talks. In his recent interviews, widely publicized in EU, former US secretary of state Henry Kissinger offered a few ideas. Moreover, the current sanctions-based approach is bolstering the narrative that suggests an inevitable ideological struggle between ""democracies and autocracies,"" i.e. between West and East. This should be a matter of serious concern. A ""sensible"" policy should avoid the trap of paralyzing much-needed global cooperation by ideological confrontation. The most urgent tasks of the world, in particular the tasks of saving the global commons, require global cooperation, not global ideological confrontation.",OPINION,VIEWPOINT,Photo: VCG,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'East': ('LOC', 1), 'West': ('LOC', 2), 'US': ('LOC', 1), 'China': ('LOC', 9), 'Slovenia': ('LOC', 1), 'Danilo Türk': ('PER', 2), 'Lu Yuanzhi': ('PER', 1), 'Xi': ('PER', 2), 'Global Times': ('ORG', 2), 'Communist Party of China': ('ORG', 1), 'CPC': ('ORG', 3), 'Jin': ('ORG', 2)}"

39,‘Shortsighted’ Estonia and Latvia quit China-CEEC out of US pressure; not to affect mechanism with their marginal role,Zhang Hui,2022-08-13,"Estonia and Latvia, trapped in the anxiety of geosecurity and under pressure from the US, have withdrawn from cooperation between China and Central and EU Countries (China-CEEC Cooperation), which, China analysts said, is a ""shortsighted approach"" and means they will lose their diplomatic independence and sacrifice their opportunities for development. The two Baltic nations' move won't have a major impact on the China-CEEC Cooperation, but pinning their hopes on the EU and the US is very unwise as the EU and the US can hardly offer them any tangible or much-needed economic help, analysts said.The two Baltic nations issued similar statements on Thursday, saying they decided to cease participation in the cooperation framework of China-CEEC Cooperation, but will continue to strive for constructive and pragmatic relations with China bilaterally and through EU-China cooperation.Estonia further said it has not attended any of the meetings of the format since February 2021.Analysts said their move will not be a setback for China or China-CEEC Cooperation as some West media claimed, as the Baltic nations cannot represent majority of the CEEC due to their limited participation in the mechanism. They noted that it's unlikely that many CEEC participants would follow suit.Liu Zuokui, a research fellow on EU studies at the China Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times that China-CEEC Cooperation will not fall apart, collapse or fail, and the two countries' move is part of framework optimization. He noted that the significance of the mechanism remains for both China and CEEC.The move comes amid the Russia-Ukraine conflict, as Baltic nations have lapsed into growing anxiety over security. Thus, they have prioritized security over economy, and even ignored the livelihoods of residents, analysts said. On the same day of their departure from the mechanism, Latvia's parliament designated Russia as a ""state sponsor of terrorism"" over the military operations against Ukraine, and Estonia said it will from next week prevent most Russia from entering the country with visas issued by Estonian authorities, according to Reuters. For Baltic nations, geopolitical and security factors are now undoubtedly crowding out the space for foreign trade, Cui Hongjian, director of the Department of EU Studies at the China Institute of International Studies, told the Global Times. Lithuania quit the mechanism in May 2021, but Liu said unlike Lithuania, whose departure was ""destructive"" due to its dangerous move to challenge the one-China principle, Latvia and Estonia in their statements said they would continue to strive for pragmatic relations with China through EU-China cooperation. Apart from the two, Lithuania went further to suggest the mechanism be replaced by cooperation between China and the EU. Lithuanian Foreign Minister Gabrielius Landsbergis called the mechanism ""redundant and divisive"" in a tweet on Thursday, and he said the mechanism should be replaced with EU27+1.However, analysts believe the CEEC nations are finding it difficult to achieve the cooperation that best suits themselves through the EU-China mechanism. In the framework of the EU, cooperation with China is mostly dominated by large EU members that focus on green technology and the digital economy, but many CEEC members actually need more infrastructure, Liu said. Five of the CEEC within the China-CEEC Cooperation framework are non-EU countries, including Albania and Serbia. Thus, China-CEEC Cooperation is a valuable supplement to China-EU cooperation, as it takes good care of the actual needs of CEEC, analysts said. China-CEEC Cooperation, launched in 2012, has become a model of trans-regional cooperation. In the past decade, the practical cooperation between China and the CEEC has doubled trade volume. China investment in CEEC has increased six-fold, according to the National Development and Reform Commission. China battery maker Contemporary Amperex Technology Ltd (CATL) said on Friday it planned to invest 7.34 billion euros ($7.56 billion) in a new plant in Hungary to supply major EU automakers.In late July, Croatia's China-built Peljesac Bridge opened, connecting two parts of the country's coastline for the first time. It is the largest infrastructure project undertaken by the China side in Croatia, illustrating the strong cooperation between China and EU, according to the Xinhua News Agency.Péter Szijjártó, Hungarian minister of foreign affairs and trade, said that the country is proud that CATL decided to execute the biggest ever greenfield investment in the history of Hungary, according to CATL. When other CEEC nations are getting more development opportunities and regional interconnections through China-CEEC Cooperation, the Baltic nations have brought politics and ideology into the economy under the influence of the US, analysts said. US State Department Spokesperson Vedant Patel said ""we respect and support Estonia's and Latvia's sovereign decision to no longer participate,"" and voiced ""deep concern"" about China's relations with Russia. Cui said the reason the Baltic nations quit the framework was also because they wanted to gain more political and security protection from the US, but blindly following the US makes it difficult for them to make decisions based on market rules. Their shortsighted approach will see them lose regional cooperation opportunities in the framework and they are unlikely to get any tangible benefits from the US, analysts said, noting that the US' economic plans are purely made to serve its geopolitical purposes without caring for partners' needs. More importantly, when the world is turning to Asia for economic opportunities as Asia, with China being one important part, represents the future of the global economy, running in the opposite direction would be a long-term loss for prosperity, Cui said.  The London-based think tank Center for Economics and Business Research forecast in early 2022 that China is expected to pass the US as the world's largest economy in 2030.""When the economic and supply chain layouts in Asia have been completed, there will be no room for Baltic nations,"" Cui said.",CHINA,DIPLOMACY,"Envoys from Central and Eastern European Countries visit Northwest China's Qinghai Province on October 22, 2021.

40,Scholars outline conditions to be met for China’s peaceful reunification,Liu Xin,2022-08-13,"China's newly released white paper on the Taiwan question showcased the historical and inevitable trend of reunification, with 1.4 billion China people's determination, sincerity in practicing ""one country, two systems"" with compatriots in Taiwan island, and China's increasing strength in preventing external interference, analysts said during a symposium held by one of China's highest-level think tanks on Friday. The Institute of Taiwan Studies of the China Academy of Social Sciences held a symposium on Friday with more than 30 experts on the Taiwan question gathering in Beijing to discuss the importance of the newly released white paper titled ""The Taiwan Question and China's Reunification in the New Era.""It was published on Wednesday, following the tensions triggered by US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's provocative visit to the island of Taiwan on August 2. Analysts at the symposium pointed out that the white paper highlights the new context in the new era for China to deal with the Taiwan question and the inevitable historical trend for China to realize reunification despite challenges. 

A missile is launched by the rocket force of the Eastern Theater Command of the China People's Liberation Army (PLA), targeting designated maritime areas to the east of the Taiwan Island, Aug. 4, 2022. The Eastern Theater Command on Thursday conducted joint combat exercises and training around the Taiwan Island on an unprecedented scale. Photo:XinhuaThe white paper starts from the preamble, displaying the China people's determination for reunification, noting that resolving the Taiwan question and realizing China's complete reunification is a shared aspiration of all the sons and daughters of the China nation, and it is indispensable for the realization of China's rejuvenation and a historical mission of the Communist Party of China (CPC).Huang Shujia, an expert from the Renmin University of China, said that China's national rejuvenation has become an inevitable trend and the mission to realize reunification is more urgent. ""While never before have the China been so close to, confident in and capable of achieving the goal, separatist forces in the island and external forces have ramped up efforts in seeking independence,"" said Huang.With this background, the newly released white paper answers questions on why we should speed up the reunification process, why we should ramp up efforts in fighting separatist forces in the island, what kind of reunification we are pursuing and in which way to realize it, and what role the people in Taiwan will play during the process of reunification. All these are questions that China people and the international community have heatedly discussed in recent weeks, Huang said. The white paper, which was not issued to merely respond to Pelosi's visit, had been in progress for a long time. It was released at such a sensitive time to make accurate and clear statements on China's policies on the Taiwan question when the whole world is closely watching what China will do and whether it will take the island back by force after its impressive military drills around the island ended, the expert said.

China, not even a bit can be left behind Graphic: Deng Zijun/GTThe PLA's recent military countermeasures to Pelosi's visit were also frequently mentioned during the symposium, with experts noting that the white paper's statements on how to realize reunification also showcased China's resolve for reunification and its sincerity in realizing it in a peaceful way. ""We will work with the greatest sincerity and exert our utmost efforts to achieve peaceful reunification. But we will not renounce the use of force, and we reserve the option of taking all necessary measures. This is to guard against external interference and all separatist activities,"" said the white paper.Pelosi's visit to Taiwan violated the red line that was mentioned in the white paper, and China's purpose is to use military methods in a peaceful way to fight against separatist forces and external forces, and China will not take a step backward from the current process of reunification, said Zheng Jian, director of the Graduate Institute for Taiwan Studies of Xiamen University.Zheng said that military force is the last resort and also a necessary method to promote peaceful reunification. When China's economy surpasses the US' and leaves it behind for a while, when China-US relations return to a balanced level, when the China mainland's governance capability and the material and spiritual levels of civilization develop to a new level, people in Taiwan will have a new understanding of the mainland, and this is a chance for peaceful reunification. However, as the white paper highlighted external forces' interference on the Taiwan question, analysts on Friday also warned that China should make full preparations for more frequent US exchanges with the separatist forces in Taiwan, increasing US presence in the region, and the collusion of US allies that pressures China over the Taiwan question. The strategic competition around the Taiwan Straits between China and the US will be fiercer in the future and the current battle around Pelosi's provocative visit is the start. The US will increase arms sales to develop the island as a ""porcupine"" with an asymmetric warfare capability and promote exchanges of the US National Guard with the military in the island, said Yuan Zheng, deputy director and senior fellow of the Institute of US Studies of the China Academy of Social Sciences.However, many experts noted that there is little possibility for the US to have direct military clashes with China over the island of Taiwan if China is forced to take drastic measures to respond to the provocation of separatist elements or external forces. ""The US is a paper tiger"" on the question of Taiwan, given China's increasing national strength and military advantage at the Taiwan Straits and as the island is not in its core interest, the US government will not sacrifice US for separatists in Taiwan, said Li Yihu, dean of Peking University's Taiwan Research Institute, noting that the US aircraft carrier USS Ronald Reagan left after Pelosi departed Taiwan, which also is a forecast of the future. Moreover, the US has no legitimacy to interfere in the question of Taiwan and its trick of starting proxy wars, which it has used in Ukraine and other places in the world, will not succeed, said Li.More than 170 countries have expressed adherence to the one-China principle and showed understanding of China's moves in defending sovereignty, which showed that China has advantages in both timing and justice in promoting reunification, analysts said.They also noted that the white paper's interpretation on promoting ""one country, two systems"" in the island of Taiwan and calling on people in Taiwan to make the right choice at a crucial historical moment will further promote the trend of reunification.For example, the white paper pointed out that foreign countries can continue to develop economic and cultural relations with Taiwan.The contents of ""one country, two systems"" will be developed in promoting reunification as people in Taiwan who can fully attend the discussion in how to realize better governance of the island after reunification, Li said. In recent years, we have reiterated the harm brought by separatist forces in the island of Taiwan and the US' interference, while paying less attention to interpret the benefits of reunification to people in the island, the region and the world. The white paper solves such problems, said Zheng, noting that contents on the benefits will also encourage people in Taiwan to choose the right side of history.",CHINA,SOCIETY,"A soldier looks through binoculars during combat exercises and training of the navy of the Eastern Theater Command of the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) in the waters around the Taiwan Island, Aug. 5, 2022.

41,"Chinese embassy urges US to assume obligations, not to make excuses for own mistakes after remarks on China's decision of halting climate talks over Pelosi's Taiwan visit",Global Times,2022-08-13,"The US should shoulder its own responsibilities and obligations rather than make excuses for its own mistakes, spokesperson for the China Embassy in the UK said in response to US officials' claims that ""the entire world will suffer the consequences"" of the halt of climate change cooperation, referring to China's decision to suspend climate talks with the US due to US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's provocative visit to the island of Taiwan. The US does not represent the world. China already warned the US in advance that Pelosi's visit to the island of Taiwan will likely lead to a crisis and cause major disruptions to exchanges and cooperation between China and the US. But the US turned a deaf ear to this warning and went its own way, the embassy spokesperson said. The Taiwan question is at the very heart of China's core interests. The US has seriously undermined China's core interests while seeking cooperation from China where it needs it. What kind of logic is this? the spokesperson said. China's decision to cancel or suspend cooperation in some areas does not come without warning. We say what we mean and mean what we say. There is no reason why the US should feel surprised or upset, the spokesperson stressed. As a responsible major country, China will, as always, actively participate in international and multilateral cooperation on climate change. We have solemnly announced that we will strive to achieve carbon peaking by 2030 and carbon neutrality by 2060. We are striving to formulate and implement a ""1+N"" policy framework for low-carbon development and green transition, said the embassy spokesperson.China will continue to unswervingly march toward the goals of carbon peaking and neutrality, actively participate in the negotiations on climate change through major channels, provide support and assistance to developing countries within China's capacity, and make its own contributions to addressing this global challenge of climate change, the spokesperson said.The embassy spokesperson urged the US to assume its own international responsibilities and obligations, not make excuses for its own mistakes.   He also lambasted some US officials who compared the Taiwan question to Ukraine issue, claiming China's military drills in Taiwan Straits similar to Russia military operations in Ukraine out of ill intentions.Taiwan question and Ukraine issue are fundamentally different and not comparable at all. Taiwan is an inalienable part of China's territory, and the Taiwan question is entirely China's internal affairs. If the US values the principle of respecting sovereignty and territorial integrity, it should apply this principle to the Taiwan question, rather than practice any double standards, the spokesperson said.  It is unacceptable to urge respect for Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity on the one hand and trample on China's red line on Taiwan and encroach up China's sovereignty and territorial integrity on the other. Taiwan is China's Taiwan. No foreign country is entitled to act as a judge on the Taiwan question, the spokesperson stressed.The US is used to stoking tensions and provoking troubles. Between the end of the World War II and 2001, there were 248 armed conflicts in 153 regions across the world, among which 201 were initiated by the US. Since 2001, wars and military operations launched by the US have resulted in over 800,000 deaths and tens of millions displaced from home, the spokesperson added.  After starting so many wars and killing so many civilians to preserve its hegemony, the US is now creating troubles in the Taiwan Straits.

42,India cannot afford US intent of dividing and ruling Asia,Long Xingchun,2022-08-13,"An India media outlet India Express revealed that India held its first political dialogue with NATO in Brussels on December 12, 2019. The talks ""hold significance,"" according to India Express, because NATO has been engaging in bilateral dialogue with both China and Pakistan, which play a role in India's strategic imperatives.Responding to the news on Friday, India's Ministry of External Affairs Spokesperson Arindam Bagchi said that India and NATO are in touch with each other at different levels for quite some time now and it's part of India's contacts with various stakeholders on global issues of mutual interests.NATO is a transatlantic military bloc, but it is normal that countries outside the region have contacts with it. As for Pakistan, NATO used to carry out operations in Afghanistan at the request of the US, therefore it needs assistance and coordination from Pakistan. It is also normal that NATO engages with major powers like China and India.What deserves alert, however, is that with the lead of the US, NATO's task has exceeded the traditional sphere of EU and North Atlantic, while the global expansion of NATO, especially US' intention to create an Asia version of NATO, is advanced with Quad as the main pillar. In this year's NATO summit, Indo-Pacific partners such as Australia, Japan, New Zealand, and South Korea participated for the first time. Meanwhile, US-India defense trade cooperation continues to expand with the Logistics Exchange Memorandum of Agreement, Communications, Compatibility and Security Agreement, and the Industrial Security Agreement. The US and India militaries will also hold high-altitude exercises in Auli in the India state of Uttarakhand in mid-October. Obviously, the US is mobilizing and integrating its alliances and partnerships in a bid to build a global military alliance system.What India means of ""mutual interests"" between India and NATO is nothing but their perceived threat from China. NATO has for the first time singled out China as one of its strategic priorities for the next decade, and India views China as its biggest rival in the Asia-Pacific region and beyond. Meanwhile, if the US and EU countries want to enhance their presence in the Asia-Pacific region, cooperation with India is a must step.Given India's traditional non-alignment diplomacy and its ambitions to become a major power, India is reluctant to be in a subordinate position in any alliances in which the US takes the central role. India may engage in some concrete cooperation with US-led NATO, now politically and in the future militarily, but there is little chance that India joins NATO.On the one hand, according to NATO principles, an attack against one Ally is considered as an attack against all Allies. Therefore, there is no need for India to be confined to this binding principle or step into conflicts with a country with which it has no direct stakes. On the other hand, India is an old hand in diplomacy. Cooperation with either the US or NATO is to seek its own interests by taking advantage of them. This is why India does not want to touch on issues that do not directly link to its interests. For instance, India didn't condemn Russia's actions in the Russia-Ukraine conflict or sanction Russia. It also did not join the US, UK and Australia, all of whom are members of Quad, to issue a statement to criticize China's military exercise in response to US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's trip to the island of Taiwan. It is worth noting that India is not designated as a major non-NATO ally of the US.From the perspective of global peace and stability, NATO should have been dissolved after the Cold War. Currently, NATO's eastward expansion has led to the Russia-Ukraine conflict. It can be said that wherever this military bloc goes, the region will witness intensified division and confrontation and come into a security dilemma. For regional countries in Asia, they do not want to end up being used as a chess piece by the US to serve its strategic goal of dividing and ruling Asia. India cannot afford this either.The author is a senior research fellow with the Academy of Regional and Global Governance at the Beijing Foreign Studies University and president of the Chengdu Institute of World Affairs. opinion@globaltimes.com.cn",OPINION,VIEWPOINT,Illustration: Chen Xia/GT,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'India': ('LOC', 17), 'Brussels': ('LOC', 1), 'China': ('LOC', 5), 'Pakistan': ('LOC', 3), 'Afghanistan': ('LOC', 1), 'US': ('LOC', 8), 'North Atlantic': ('LOC', 1), 'Asia': ('LOC', 3), 'Indo': ('LOC', 1), 'Pacific': ('LOC', 3), 'Australia': ('LOC', 1), 'Japan': ('LOC', 1), 'New Zealand': ('LOC', 1), 'South Korea': ('LOC', 1), 'Auli': ('LOC', 1), 'Uttarakhand': ('LOC', 1), 'India Express': ('ORG', 2), 'NATO': ('ORG', 12), 'of External Affairs': ('ORG', 1), 'EU': ('ORG', 2), 'Arindam Bagchi': ('PER', 1), 'Exchange Me': ('MISC', 1), 'Agreement': ('MISC', 2), 'Communications': ('MISC', 1), 'Co': ('MISC', 1), 'Industrial Security Agreement': ('MISC', 3)}"
43,Wide criticism in US and Europe of Pelosi’s Taiwan visit not adequately reflected in Western media: Clare Daly,Global Times,2022-08-12,"Editor's Note:  It's been a little over a week since US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi wrapped up her sneaky visit to the Taiwan island, but the mess she created remains in the already tense situation. ""Whatever way you look at it, it is bad statecraft. It is not adult behavior,"" Clare Daly (Daly), an Irish politician and member of the EU Parliament, told the Global Times (Global Times) in a written interview. Reports show that on Pelosi's trip, EU largely stays out of the fray, but a number of Lithuanian and UK politicians seem to want to follow suit. ""Ordinary people want peace not war. Their leaders should try to reflect that preference,"" said Daly. 

Clare Daly. Photo: Courtesy of Clare DalyGT: On Twitter, you said Pelosi's visit to Taiwan island was ""a stupid, vain, reckless decision, with potentially dire consequences for everyone alive, taken for the sake of a meaningless publicity stunt."" Would you elaborate on this view?Daly: Whatever your view on the status of Taiwan, the status quo involves a delicate diplomatic balance. This includes decades of cautious US policy on Taiwan - something recognized by most US foreign policy experts on cross-Straits relations. Pelosi's trip, at the present moment, appears to signal a change in the US posture, whether or not there actually is a change. That could have runaway consequences. It seems to have been done for no other reason than show off, and make the Democrats look tough on China. US foreign policy experts are alarmed by it. Even the White House didn't want her to go. This is destabilizing and irresponsible. Nobody gains from it: not China, not the US and not people in Taiwan. Whatever way you look at it, it is bad statecraft. It is not adult behavior.  Global Times: According to your knowledge, do other EU politicians share your view? Daly: Plenty of politicians in Ireland and EU understand and share my views. The Pelosi visit has also been widely criticized in the US, not just by people on the left, but by liberals and academics who understand the situation. This is not reflected in some West media, but many subtleties of international politics fly over the heads of West media. But even the New York Times criticized the visit. It is widely accepted that this visit was unhelpful. Global Times: In response to Pelosi's visit to Taiwan island, more than 170 countries and many international organizations have reiterated their commitment to one-China principle. While it seems not many countries, other than G7 and Australia are on US side. What's your take on this phenomenon? Daly: I am not on the US or the China side. I am on the side of peace. In the present circumstances, ensuring peace requires caution, diplomacy and compromise. These are increasingly rare qualities in international diplomacy.Global Times: Only a few months after the Russia-Ukraine conflict broke out, the US escalated its conflict with another major power - China. Do you think the US is accelerating its pace on the path of strategic adventurism?Daly: Global civilization is facing the most extreme threat: climate breakdown. Disaster will engulf our planet if there is not sustained global cooperation to address it. In that context, all sides should show restraint, and focus on cooperation, not conflict.Global Times: Some UK legislators plan to visit Taiwan island in November, and some Lithuanian politicians have already landed on the island this week, following Pelosi's tour. Are they placing their personal interests above national interests? How would their voters view the politicians' Taiwan trips?Daly: Everybody should have the right to travel to wherever they like, including politicians, but that's a different thing to somebody making an official visit. Official delegations of this type stand only to exacerbate cross-Straits tensions, and don't help anyone. I don't know the opinions of the UK or Lithuanian public on this, but in general, ordinary people want peace not war. Their leaders should try to reflect that preference.",OPINION,VIEWPOINT,"China, US Illustration: Liu Rui/GT",Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'US House': ('ORG', 1), 'EU Parliament': ('ORG', 4), 'Global Times': ('ORG', 5), 'P': ('ORG', 3), 'New': ('ORG', 1), 'Nancy Pelosi': ('PER', 4), 'Clare Daly': ('PER', 7), 'Taiwan': ('LOC', 5), 'UK': ('LOC', 1), 'US': ('LOC', 6), 'China': ('LOC', 2), 'White House': ('LOC', 1), 'Ireland': ('LOC', 1), 'West': ('LOC', 2), 'York': ('LOC', 1), 'Irish': ('MISC', 1), 'Lithuanian': ('MISC', 1), 'cross': ('MISC', 1), 'Straits': ('MISC', 1), 'Democrats': ('MISC', 1)}"
44,"One year on, Afghans still have a lot of disappointment and anger toward US: former Afghan president",Global Times,2022-08-11,"Editor's Note:It's almost been one year since the US withdrawal debacle in Afghanistan, during which time this war-torn country has suffered and changed a lot. What are the changes of the Afghan people's attitude toward the US and the US military after the war? Instead of trying to embezzle Afghan resources like the US did, China has offered emergency aid to Afghanistan and maintained communication with the Taliban. How should we view the two different approaches by China and the US in developing ties with post-withdrawal Afghanistan? Global Times (Global Times) reporter Wang Wenwen talked to Hamid Karzai (Karzai), former Afghan president, over these issues.Global Times: How would you describe the changes in Afghanistan you have witnessed during the one year's time? What is your biggest feeling toward your country?Karzai: It is sad that the US presence in Afghanistan failed to capitalize or use properly the goodwill of the international community and the support of the Afghan people for the peace process that they conducted, which led to the debacle of their withdrawal. Unfortunately, the manner of withdrawal itself was dishonorable to the people of Afghanistan and to the people of the US. To describe it all in short - extremely tragic and saddening.As for the changes in Afghanistan, in terms of overall security and the end of major conflict, it has been positive. The Afghans are not dying anymore in those large numbers in which we were losing many lives daily previously. But in terms of political stability and economic viability, in terms of the country finding its place in the international community with our flag flying high around the world, no, we have not done well.Global Times: You once called Joe Biden's order to unfreeze Afghan assets for 9/11 victim families atrocity. How are the assets being used? As far as you know, does the US plan to return the $7 billion Afghan assets? What efforts does Afghanistan make to get back the Afghan assets?Karzai: That is one of the biggest losses to US of the failure of the peace process. The leaving of the government from Kabul, the arrival of the Taliban without the conclusion of the peace process led to immensely negative consequences for Afghanistan.The seizure of $7 billion dollars of Afghan reserves is wrong and not acceptable to the Afghan people. This is Afghan money - owned and belonging to the Afghan people. We don't want this money to be split into two halves as the US is saying now.Afghanistan was not, in any case, involved in the tragedy of September 11. Rather, Afghanistan itself has been a victim of terrorism. We are more a victim than any other country in the world. The US cannot take money from one victim to give it to another victim. We deserve the return of all of our money back.   But it doesn't mean that once that money comes back to Afghanistan, it should be spent by the current government or any other government. That money belongs to the Afghan people as surety for the strength of our currency, the afghani. It should be kept as our national reserves.

Hamid Karzai Photo: VCGGT: The Afghan people once offered huge support to the US presence in Afghanistan. But the ending of the Afghan war is an enormous suffering to the Afghan people. What are the changes of the Afghan people's attitude toward the US and the US military after the war?Karzai: Yes, the Afghan people offered huge support to US and allies presence in Afghanistan. A lot of disappointment, a lot of anger, at the way things were conducted when they were here and then the way they withdrew from Afghanistan. Imagine the scenes at the airport, imagine the chaos that was created, imagine the way the Afghan state collapsed, the loss of the army, the loss of the forces, the loss of the institutions, the loss of our military equipment. That's something that Afghans are extremely angry about. So the US has a responsibility toward Afghanistan to make sure that Afghanistan does not suffer anymore. First is to return Afghanistan's resources and second is to make sure that they engage with Afghanistan in a manner that is beneficial to both the Afghan people and the US. We want to have good relations with the US of US, but that relationship must be based on mutual respect and mutual interest. We Afghans must take our own responsibility as well. We must work for the stability and wellbeing of our country by strengthening our unity and by serving and protecting it. The government should be representing all the people of Afghanistan and adopt policies promoting the aspirations of our people and keep the country safe from extremism and terrorism.Global Times: Only a few months after the hasty US withdrawal from Afghanistan, the US is mired in the Ukraine crisis. Many think the US is turning Ukraine into another Afghanistan. What's your take?Karzai: We have an experience in that and I have already spoken about it and called upon the Ukraine leadership to learn from the sufferings of Afghanistan. During the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan 40 years ago and during the height of the Cold War, on the one hand, Afghanistan was struggling for liberation but on the other hand, Afghanistan was used in the rivalry of the Cold War. Both sides got US hurt and made US suffer.Ukraine must understand that they must not get stepped over by wrong policies in the conflict between huge powers and that their interest is in making sure that they live peacefully in the region that they belong to and not get involved in superpower politics in which the only loser will be Ukraine as was Afghanistan during the Cold War.Global Times: The disgraceful role of NATO is behind the two decades of US military's occupation of Afghanistan. Now in EU, NATO is intensifying the conflict between Russia and EU and trying to extend to Asia. As an Afghan that has experienced the NATO-led war, how do you comment on the role and impact of this military alliance?Karzai: The chaotic withdrawal, as it happened, reflects negatively. The military aspect of the US and NATO presence in Afghanistan was a failure by all accounts and led to our suffering.Global Times: How do you see the two different approaches by China and the US in developing ties with post-withdrawal Afghanistan?Karzai: The China and the US examples are two different examples. The US arrival was the consequence of the tragedy of September 11 and the decision of the UN and the support of international community. Its presence in Afghanistan was unfortunately not capitalized on properly by the US which led to the consequences that we just talked about.China has looked at Afghanistan from a different angle. And we expect China, as a neighbor to help bring stability and security. As a neighbor the China role is very important. We want China to be a significant contributor to our stability and economic viability.Global Times: Now Afghanistan faces the huge challenges of postwar reconstruction, while the world is in turbulence. What can the world do in assisting Afghanistan? What role can China play, both politically and economically?Karzai: Afghanistan is going through immense difficulties. Our youth and our educated are leaving the country. The de facto government is not yet recognized by the international community. There are things that must be done immediately inside Afghanistan, like reopening the girls school, which is extremely important for the future of this country and also for our economy, plus a lot more.But there are also things that the international community can do. Specifically with regard to China, China is a neighbor of Afghanistan and a superpower in our neighborhood. China can have both political and economic contributions toward Afghanistan's durable stability and wellbeing.Politically, I have always been suggesting, even three to four years ago when the US launched its peace process in Afghanistan, to the US, to China and to Russia that the peace process better be co-authored, co- directed by the US, China and Russia, and that the three countries should work together for a genuinely effective peace process. Had that happened, Afghanistan would have been in a different, much better situation now.Now, I'm suggesting the same - China, as a neighbor of Afghanistan and as a global power, begin to see that instability in Afghanistan has consequences for the region, especially for China, and to prevent that China can coordinate with Russia and the US and major powers in this region to launch a process that would bring political stability to Afghanistan and economic interaction between Afghanistan and the larger region.China can also be a close friend of Pakistan, work with Pakistan for positive engagement with Afghanistan. The people of Afghanistan and the people of Pakistan are brotherly people. The Pakistani people have looked after the Afghan refugees for decades, for which we are very grateful. But there are certain issues that are of concern to Afghanistan. China can have a positive contribution in this regard.Then there are economic projects that are extremely important for this region. They can only happen if there is stability in Afghanistan. We appreciate China's engagement with Afghanistan. We want this engagement to continue. We believe China is in the right position to help our country.Global Times: US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi made a visit to Taiwan. What do you think of the US interference in the Taiwan Straits? Afghanistan paid huge costs to the US meddling. What lessons could Afghanistan give to Taiwan?Karzai: Afghanistan firmly stands by one-China policy and is fully and entirely committed to the territorial integrity of our neighbor China. This has been the steadfast stand of Afghanistan from the very establishment of Afghanistan-China diplomatic relation. All aspects of our relation with China are pillared upon one-China policy, so this is our stand in all our international interactions.We strongly believe in the pursuit of the same policy in relations between China and other countries viewing it as profoundly important for world peace and harmony.",OPINION,VIEWPOINT,"The British armed forces work with the US military to evacuate eligible civilians and their families out of Afghanistan on August 21, 2021 in Kabul, Afghanistan.

45,US diplomacy and understanding of the world is of a very low standard,Global Times,2022-08-11,"Last week, US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi made a reckless visit to the island of Taiwan, disregarding warnings from the China mainland. Meanwhile, the military conflict between Russia and Ukraine has entered the sixth month, and the US-provoked Ukraine crisis is not seeing any sign of de-escalation. Some believe just as the US wants to use the Ukraine crisis to deplete Russia's power, it also intends to use the Taiwan question to contain China. Right now, we can see that the US doesn't want the situation to be stabilized both in the Ukraine crisis and over the Taiwan question. I understand that both questions have a completely different nature and history. But the approach of the US is the same. US's main idea is to deregulate the balance of the situation both in EU and the Asia-Pacific, to crash normal trading relations and financial markets, and in this way to push down the Renminbi level and raise the level of the US dollar. That is also one of the ideas behind why the US is provoking a conflict in the Taiwan Straits.As the Russia-Ukraine crisis goes on, no one predicted such a situation to occur. According to the West media, Russia believed that the operation should be ended in three days or one week. At the same time, many EU countries also thought that Russia would lose in just one week. So no one was correct, and it means the situation is changing drastically for all countries involved, none of which was prepared for this situation.The EU also was completely unprepared for this situation. For example, we can see the huge problem with gas and oil supply, because EU was dependent on Russia. It wanted to put sanctions against Russia, but at the same time, keep the same supply of gas and oil in this way to maintain the normal way of life in EU. And it's impossible right now. If you're engaged in a battle, you should understand that you can lose it too.Currently, some EU companies are trying to reconsider their approach to Russia. Many have started to renew the negotiations with Russia and want to come back to the Russia market, because it's impossible to live without Russia. It's not because Russia is so great. It's because the modern world is interconnected. The modern world is created by trade relations, not by war.The Russia-Ukraine military conflict and the current tensions in the Taiwan Straits caused by Pelosi's provocation have dimmed the prospect of forming the China-US-Russia triangle. Theoretically, this triangle is possible because we have a lot of common challenges, for example, a pandemic like COVID-19 and many problems in space exploration. Thus, we have a lot of common things to do.Despite warnings from politicians, such as the very wise former US secretary of state Henry Kissinger, that the US should not be an enemy of both China and Russia, US seems to be set on the path of confronting both countries. Just look at the modern generation of present-day US politicians - their intellectual level is much lower than that of Kissinger or, for example, Richard Nixon, who normalized ties with China more than 40 years ago.Right now, US diplomacy and understanding of the world situation is of a very low standard than it was 10 years ago, or 40 years ago. That's why I think that the China-US-Russia triangle, unfortunately, is currently impossible. Instead, we can establish another triangle, for example, the one between Russia, China and India, which could be very providing and interesting.The article was compiled by Global Times reporter Xia Wenxin based on an interview with Alexey Maslov, director of the Institute of Asia and Africa Studies of Moscow State University. opinion@globaltimes.com.cn",OPINION,VIEWPOINT,US hegemony Illustration: Liu Rui/GT,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'US House': ('ORG', 1), 'EU': ('ORG', 6), 'Nancy Pelosi': ('PER', 1), 'Taiwan': ('LOC', 3), 'China': ('LOC', 2), 'Russia': ('LOC', 13), 'Ukraine': ('LOC', 6), 'US': ('LOC', 7), 'Asia': ('LOC', 1), 'Pacific': ('LOC', 1), 'Taiwan Straits': ('LOC', 5), 'Ren': ('MISC', 1), 'West': ('MISC', 1)}"
46,12 vessels authorized to depart Ukrainian ports for grain export: UN official,Xinhua – Reuters,2022-08-11,"Under the Black Sea Initiative, 12 vessels have been authorized to depart the Ukraine ports, a UN official coordinating the grain export deal said Wednesday.These ships contain ""over 370,000 metric tons of grain and other food stocks,"" Frederick Kenney, interim coordinator for the UN at the Joint Coordination Center for the Black Sea Initiative, told a regular press briefing held at the UN headquarters in New York via video link from Istanbul, Turkey.The Ukraine grain export deal is off with a very good start, said Kenney, noting that a big ""uptick"" in applications for transit is expected.""We still have much work ahead of US to ensure that the implementation of the initiative translates into real results to address food insecurity around the globe and to stabilize global food markets,"" he said.On July 22, Russia and Ukraine signed a deal with Turkey and the UN to allow food and fertilizer exports from three key Ukraine ports in the Black Sea. Russia, Ukraine, Turkey and the UN agreed transit procedures on Monday for the July deal. The procedures include a 10-nautical-mile (18.5-kilometer) protection zone for ships. ""The goal of getting between 2 and 5 [million] metric tons is achievable,"" Kenney said, referring to monthly exports.The aim of the deal is to help ease a global food crisis that the UN says was worsened by the Russia-Ukraine conflict and has pushed tens of millions more people into hunger. Ukraine and Russia are both major wheat exporters.Kenney said the current priority was to free up pier space at the three ports covered by the deal - Odesa, Chornomorsk and Yuzhny - so new ships could come in and load cargo. There have been no wheat shipments yet with departing vessels so far carrying corn, soybeans and sunflower oil and meal.Ukraine has some 20 million tons of grain left over from 2021's crop and 2022's wheat harvest, which is estimated to be a further 20 million tons.",WORLD,EUROPE,Picture description not found,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'Black Sea Initiative': ('MISC', 2), 'Ukraine': ('LOC', 8), 'New York': ('LOC', 1), 'Istanbul': ('LOC', 1), 'Turkey': ('LOC', 3), 'US': ('LOC', 1), 'Russia': ('LOC', 4), 'Black Sea': ('LOC', 1), 'Odesa': ('LOC', 1), 'Chornomorsk': ('LOC', 1), 'Yuzhny': ('LOC', 1), 'UN': ('ORG', 6), 'Joint Coordination Center': ('ORG', 1), 'Frederick Kenney': ('PER', 4)}"
47,Title not found,Toumert AI,2022-08-11,"US Secretary of State Antony Blinken is visiting Africa from Sunday to Friday, and he has already visited South Africa and the DRC, before heading to Rwanda. Antony Blinken's visit to the Africa continent can be seen as the Joe Biden administration's pivot toward Africa. As the US has considered China as a major competitor, it is normal for many in the world to see Antony Blinken's trip as a counter-China political posturing.While the visit itself has come under the veil of a new US administration keen to portray itself as the champion of cooperation and empowering the Africa continent, the trip is actually a diplomatic show that brings no benefit to the local communities in Africa and will not address the macroeconomic difficulties that many Africa countries face. On the first leg of his Africa trip, Antony Blinken gave a speech on the US' strategy toward sub-Saharan Africa at the University of Pretoria on Monday. Antony Blinken said that Africa was an ""equal partner"" that the US wanted to work with and would not ""dictate to.""It is undeniable that Antony Blinken's visit was a direct response to Russia Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov's Africa tour. The US government's diplomatic mantra has been aggressive and can be very concerning since it alters the global status quo of power stabilityThe US' new ""cold war"" mentality in the disguise of global competition is triggering new proxy wars in EU, like the Ukraine crisis, and global food and energy shortages. It is also fueling a worldwide inflation and anemic growth that is damaging many economies.To put in perspective, Africa policymakers will be cautious about Antony Blinken's sudden offer of US cooperation and support, since there is no concrete sum of funds being allocated to support Africa infrastructure, its economic development, or help deal with its health crisis. The US should not use Africa as a chess piece to pursue its own foreign policy goals, and give Africa people a break. Africa is expecting a lot of outside support to facilitate post-COVID19 recovery in all economic and societal fields, from tourism revival, to investing in infrastructure projects like roads and ports, and to increase employability and digital connectivity in the under-developed continent. Also, Africa is going through a food and water supply crisis that calls for outside direct investment to help resolve the difficulties. Africa 'not take the bait'China has emerged as the major trading partner of the Africa continent, with a total transaction volume reaching a staggering$245 billion in goods trade in 2022, dwarfing EU and US countries.The numbers reflect the importance that China policymakers attach on assisting Africa in planning China's global development strategy, typically with the execution of the Belt and Road initiative (BRI) since 2013.It is interesting to note the resiliency and adaptability of China's investment in Africa continent and the evolution of the BRI. While it started in 2013 as an infrastructure investment platform to link China to the outside world and help build more infrastructural projects such as the charismatic Ethiopian-Kenyan Railway, now it focuses more on green development and the digital economy, while reducing Africa's trade deficit by increasing imports from the continent. And this is where the difference rests between China and the West when it comes to truly helping Africa. The BRI represents concrete solutions in investment and trade that help erect regional economic corridors and support local government to access funds to develop their own economies, as long as the projects reflect a win-win solution for all stakeholders.Against the backdrop, many people like to believe that Africa nations will not take the US bait, and casually switch sides. China-Africa engagement has been a highly successful formula when it comes to South-to-South cooperation, as both parties have benefited greatly from this strategic partnership, and at the same time, Africa has found in China a reliable friend, with no colonial history.Antony Blinken's Africa trip is unlikely to impact the cooperation under the BRICS mechanism nor would he able to push South Africa to criticize the bloc. South Africa's position with the BRICS is rock solid and based on mutual interest in creating an alternative solution in global governance. Amid Antony Blinken's Africa trip, US Marine Corps General Michael Langley has assumed command of US Africa Command during a ceremony held at Kelley Barracks in Germany recently. This could also be interpreted as a shift in US military involvement toward Africa.The new US command is meant to indicate US's re-focus on Africa continent and this can be very dangerous for Africa and Africa people as the US government might use its military might and security issues to coerce, threaten and pressure Africa nations, particularly on those small and weak governments on the continent which prefer to be neutral and take their sovereign policy decisions without being held hostage at the gunpoint of US.The article was complied based on an interview with Toumert AI, the honorific secretary general of China Morocco Friendship Association.",SOURCE,B&R INITIATIVE,"The first phase of the Nairobi-Malaba railway in Kenya built by a Chinese enterprise is officially opened to traffic on October 16, 2019.

48,UK descends into being 'colony of US' as Truss summons Chinese ambassador over Taiwan,Zhang Hui,2022-08-11,"UK Foreign Secretary Elizabeth Truss, due to need of her campaign to become the next prime minister and the UK's policy of clinging to the US' apron strings, criticized China for its countermeasures over US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's Taiwan visit, which only proved that UK has lost its credibility as an independent country, China analysts said. They stressed that China will firmly respond to provocations from the US and its allies that challenge the one-China principle and undermine China's sovereignty and territorial integrity. Elizabeth Truss on Wednesday summoned China Ambassador to UK Zheng Zeguang over ""Beijing's aggressive escalation against Taiwan,"" and claimed that ""increasingly aggressive behavior and rhetoric from Beijing threaten peace and stability in the region,"" according to a statement on the website of the UK Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office.  In response, China Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said at Thursday's media briefing that China is strongly dissatisfied with and firmly opposed to this and has lodged solemn representations with UK. ""If Scotland were to collude with external forces and split itself from the UK, would the UK remain calm, show restraint, sit by and watch the situation deteriorate?"" Wang asked. Ambassador Zheng Zeguang has once again lodged solemn representations to the UK side on the latter's wrong remarks and deeds on the question of Taiwan and firmly refuted its wanton accusations on Wednesday during his meeting with UK senior officials.  Zheng stressed that whether it's talk about ""helping Taiwan defend itself"" or the plan by parliamentarians to visit Taiwan, they both constitute serious violations of the one-China principle and the Communiqué of the Governments of the China and of the United Kingdom of Great UK and Northern Ireland on an Exchange of Ambassadors issued 50 years ago. They will inevitably lead to severe consequences for China-UK relations and the UK side knows this all too well, he said. UK is joining the US and is not taking into account what will happen if the China mainland does not effectively contain Taiwan secessionists, Wang Yiwei, director of the Institute of International Affairs at the Renmin University of China, told the Global Times on Thursday. The White House summoned China Ambassador to the US Qin Gang last week to condemn China's military activities around the island of Taiwan. According to the China embassy, Qin sternly rejected the unreasonable accusations of the US side on China's military countermeasures.  ""Now it seems that the UK has been colonized by the US, and it has failed to see how badly it's being used by the US,"" Wang said. He urged UK to reflect on its current domestic problems and concentrate on solving them, instead of creating issues over Ukraine and the Taiwan Straits. The UK has learned no lessons from stirring up the Hong Kong-related issue and now it wants to stir up the situation across the Taiwan Straits, which is all because it cannot find its value after Brexit. Thus it is bumping around to show its existence, Wang Yiwei said. As Elizabeth Trusss remarks were made while she was running to come UK's next prime minister, Wang Yiwei said her comments were a political show for the leadership race, after all, being tough on China is politically correct in the West. As for future China-UK relations, Liu Zuokui, a research fellow on EU studies at the China Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times on Thursday that since the UK was strapped tightly to the chariot of the US, China-UK relations are likely to continue to fall along with China-US relations. Aside from the UK, some Lithuanian politicians have also ""jumped high"" over the Taiwan question, and analysts warned that countries like Lithuania will continue to poke China over the issue. But they stressed that China will make a strong and necessary response to countries like Lithuania if they play with fire on the one-China principle, such as sanctions against more of their politicians or even the severing of diplomatic ties.",CHINA,POLITICS,Liz Truss Photo: AFP,"Reporter, Beijing","Global Times reporter covering international relations, politics, public health and science.","{'UK': ('LOC', 12), 'US': ('LOC', 5), 'China': ('LOC', 17), 'Taiwan': ('LOC', 7), 'Beijing': ('LOC', 2), 'Scotland': ('LOC', 1), 'United Kingdom': ('LOC', 1), 'Great UK': ('LOC', 13), 'Northern Ireland': ('LOC', 1), 'Elizabeth Truss': ('PER', 2), 'Nancy Pelosi': ('PER', 1), 'Zheng Zeguang': ('PER', 3), 'Wang Wenbin': ('PER', 3), 'Qin': ('PER', 1), 'Qinson': ('PER', 1), 'US House': ('ORG', 1), 'UK Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office': ('ORG', 1), 'Foreign Ministry': ('ORG', 1), 'Exchange of': ('ORG', 1), 'Yi': ('ORG', 1), 'Institute': ('ORG', 1), 'International Affairs': ('ORG', 1), 'Ren': ('ORG', 1), 'University': ('ORG', 1), 'Global Times': ('ORG', 1), 'White House': ('ORG', 1), 'Gang': ('ORG', 1), 'one': ('MISC', 2)}"
49,"More Americans denounce Pelosi's overstepping of boundaries on China-US relations, realize importance of 'one-China principle'",Lin Xiaoyi,2022-08-10,"Upon ending her Asia trip on August 5, 2022, including China's Taiwan, US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said she returns to the US ""inspired,"" however, her ill-conceived visit has left a trail of anger and frustration in the Asia-Pacific region, with such negative emotions also sweeping across the US thanks to the series of upheavals and disputes she stirred up.On August 8, several US anti-war NGOs including Pivot to Peace, the ANSWER Coalition, and the Boston Liberation, along with members of the China US community in Boston, held a demonstration in front of the JFK Federal Building in Boston demanding Pelosi to resign, stop inflaming potential war with China, and instead focus on the real issues facing the US People. Holding up signs that read ""US Hands off Taiwan"" and ""Stop the Provocations on China,"" members of the community expressed their outrage toward Pelosi's visit to the island of Taiwan in blatant disregard of long-standing US-China agreements, which they considered would have a severe impact on the political foundation of China-US relations. ""What has impressed US is that we have received such passionate support in so short a time. We were able to mobilize rapidly and express our voices,"" convener of the Boston protest William Lee with Pivot to Peace, an organization of US working to oppose war and hostility between the US and China, told the Global Times.""Pelosi pretends not to see our demands and struggles, so we are going to speak up and stand up to her, letting her see on the newspapers how shameful what she did was,"" said Julie Tang, a retired judge who served on the bench at the San Francisco Superior Court for more than two decades.The entire world watched with trepidation as Pelosi touched down in Taiwan region, and upon her departure, questions persisted - Why is the US public so adamantly opposed to Pelosi's Taiwan trip? What are the adverse effects of her actions? Why are they speaking out for China?'Thanks to China's restraint'In San Francisco, nearly 5,000 kilometers from Boston, about 17 US NGOs along with some one hundred residents from Pelosi's congressional district gathered outside her office on August 2, urging Pelosi to stop recklessly pushing China and the US to the brink of war at the expense of US interests. ""Unfortunately, our actions failed to stop Pelosi's Taiwan trip. But thanks to China's restraint, we have the opportunity to continue to launch action alerts,"" said US political activist Jodie Evans, co-founder of CODEPINK, a women-led US anti-war organization, which currently has been calling on their members to contact members of Congress to stand firmly and publicly in their commitment to peace.It was founded in 2002 as a grassroots effort to prevent the US war on Iraq. ""When I see the US playing the same playbook against China as against Iraq through lying and constant provocations, especially when China has clearly drawn its red line on the Taiwan question, and the US government has crossed it, we realized we needed to do something to stop the conflict,"" Jodie told the Global Times.In addition to reaching out to the members of Congress and calling for peace, the residents of San Francisco are, likewise, planning to sign a petition under Pivot to Peace, calling for Pelosi's resignation.""These actions are an opportunity for US to express the true will and anger of the US people and to tell Pelosi she has to be stopped,"" said Julie Tang, a retired judge who served on the bench at the San Francisco Superior Court for more than two decades, who is also a co-founder of Pivot to Peace, told the Global Times.Tang noted that the call to action against Pelosi instantly received a massive response when it was issued. Because currently, US are observing firsthand the dangerous and irresponsible actions of Pelosi-led US politicians who ignore continued warnings from the US and China, as well as China's follow up determined military response, which they realized could lead their country, after the Ukraine crisis, to be involved in another indirect conflict with the top nuclear-armed power, she said.Pelosi's trip to Taiwan island showed the US people how the country's political elites play with international situations, said Tang Jingtai, professor at the School of Journalism at Fudan University. ""This harsh reality revealed that US politicians can tie everyone to the runaway carriage of the US wandering on the edge of conflict for their own selfish interests,"" he told the Global Times.'She ignores livelihoods in US'""We know that Pelosi wanted to be a hero. Her Taiwan trip was like her last hurrah, but it was foolish,"" Tang said.As pointed out by the US media, with the upcoming US midterm elections, Pelosi expects to divert the attention of the domestic public by taking the initiative to provoke China to grab back some votes for the Democrats who are in an electoral slump.""But her willingness to risk harming all US by provoking China reveals the truth about her self-serving political interests and proves that she has totally disqualified herself as a leader for US,"" Tang noted.Tang said that as Pelosi's constituents, San Francisco residents have been calling, writing, and emailing Pelosi's office, asking her to stop further antagonizing other countries. ""We even tried to submit a petition of 1,400 signatures that we had collected within three days. But we received no response from them,"" she said.According to the Wall Street Journal, Pelosi has said her trip was meant to strengthen mutual security, economic partnership, and democratic governance. But US are disappointed and saddened that while Pelosi recklessly peddles ""democracy"" to other countries, she deliberately and selectively ignores the worsening situation of people's livelihoods in the US, especially in her own constituency.""The homelessness crisis is serious in San Francisco, and our food bills have risen so high right now, and we are really concerned about the huge disparity between the rich and the poor,"" Tang complained.On February 23, 2022, a total of 7,800 homeless people were counted in San Francisco, 4,400 of whom were unsheltered, local media reports said, which is ""an unusually high number."" According to NBC news, in June, inflation in the Bay Area hit a 38-year high.Lee noted that in addition to rising inflation exposing more and more US families to food insecurity and housing instability, the US' infrastructure is crumbling, most notably in Boston, with frequent fires and malfunctions in public transportation endangering the lives of commuters.""Every day, the US public sees evidence that those elected to our government do not have their focus on what is affecting the average person. In the meantime, blame our country's problems on countries they consider their enemies like China,"" he said.'We have a lot to learn from China'""For a long time, US propaganda is full-on hatred of China, the US people's heart and compassion has been used by people with ulterior motives,"" Jodie said. During the visit to Taiwan island, Pelosi exploited various occasions to slander China on issues such as democracy, human rights, and religion, which have been repeatedly proven to be grand lies. Jodie told the Global Times that in the face of continued unfounded smears against China which has stirred up hostility in both countries and even seriously affected the personal safety of Asia US, CODEPINK launched a campaign called ""China Is Not Our Enemy"" to share objective and factual information about China to allow more US who are being misinformed to learn more about this country.CODEPINK has been enumerating the questions that the US public has about China, such as this country's policy on the prevention and control of COVID-19, and providing objective answers. The campaign also includes an online coalition asking the US Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) to resume airing the documentary Voices from the Frontline: China's War on Poverty, which delves into China's transformative policies that have lifted millions of citizens out of extreme poverty.""We have told PBS to stop censoring the truth about China and contributing to anti-China rhetoric and anti-Asia violence! Tell them, don't be afraid of the truth!"" Jodie said.On many occasions that are important to the development of relations between China and the US, many NGOs have also swung into action. This year, for example, marks the 50th anniversary of the signing of the Shanghai Communiqué between the US and China, in which the US made a clear commitment that Taiwan is a part of China, members of Pivot to Peace put up banners saying ""Honor Shanghai Communiqué"" on the streets of San Francisco and gathered at local civic center to give a speech calling for the peaceful development of the two countries.

A banner commemorating the Shanghai Communiqué hangs over a street in San Francisco in February 2022. Photo: Courtesy of Julie Tang""We commemorate events and speak up. As US citizens, the only thing we can do is to affect our government,"" Tang said, noting that because they rely entirely on individual donors, unlike some notorious anti-China NGOs which are heavily supported by the US government, ""we have very little resources, so we just do activities, write letters to the editor, hoping that the media will cover it, and we have slowly recruited a lot of people."" But to Tang's credit, their organization has steadily attracted more members who have gradually expanded from China US who initially knew more about China to being representative of the entire US.""There are a lot of brilliant activists who are willing to show up in a heartbeat and continue to do the work we are doing now,"" Jodie said. She noted that at present, Pelosi's antics have instead become the best promotion for the one-China principle. Tang Jingtai noted that at present, the number of organizations that do recognize that they have been fooled by the US government is gradually growing through the use the Internet to strengthen their voices, unify the consensus, and further recognize the true face of the US, and that US-China relations still have a long way to go.""US people want to find out what's wrong. Why is everyone against Pelosi's visit to the Taiwan region? Why do they keep talking about one-China? We already have the answers,"" she said.""We're stepping up our education and communication actions. It is inspirational as you can share the true reality and stir hearts enough to encourage involvement, and then our list grows with people wanting to engage. They do it with love and joy, and that we do work that promotes the idea that the two countries can learn from each other, because we have a lot to learn from China,"" Jodie said.

50,"China's CPI hits a two-year high of 2.7% in July, but PPI edges down",Gloabl Times,2022-08-10,"China's consumer price index (CPI), a main gauge of inflation, hit a two-year high of 2.7 percent year-on-year growth in July amid steady food price rises and seasonable factors, the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) said on Wednesday.However, market analysts said the country's CPI is expected to come within the 3-percent annual growth target, thanks to continuous production resumption and the expected bumper farm harvest.The country's CPI rose 2.7 percent year-on-year in July, expanding from 2.5 percent in June, the bureau reported. Though lower than most analysts' forecast of 2.9 percent growth, last month's figure is the highest since July 2020.The increase on a year-on-year basis was mainly due to steep food price rises, including pork and vegetables. Food prices rose 6.3 percent year-on-year in July, contributing 1.12 percentage points to the monthly CPI increase, according to Dong Lijuan, a statistician from the NBS.In July, pork price rose 20.2 percent year-on-year, reversing a drop of 6 percent in June. Prices of fruits and vegetables rose by 16.9 percent and 12.9 percent year-on-year, respectively, NBS said.China's consumer prices are expected to maintain at a moderate level throughout the second half of the year, Zhou Maohua, a macroeconomic analyst at Everbright Bank, told the Global Times. ""The country has seen a bumper agricultural harvest for years, with ample supply of fruit and vegetables and other daily necessities, whereas the authorities have come up with a wide range of stimulus measures to stabilize domestic energy prices,"" he said, noting that domestic pork production has returned to normal.China will likely see its CPI remain within a reasonable range in the coming months, and is capable of controlling inflation within the 3-percent annual growth target, despite the fallout of COVID-19 resurgences and the Russia-Ukraine conflict, Wan Jinsong, director of the Price Department at the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), said at a recent press conference.It's worth noting that the producer price index (PPI), a main gauge of factory prices, decelerated in July after hovering at a relatively high level for eight months. The PPI rose 4.2 percent year-on-year last month, down from 6.1 percent rise registered for June, according to the NBS.The prices of industrial products are broadly dropping due to a variety of internal and external factors. For example, prices across the coal mining sector rose 20.7 percent year-on-year in July, down 10.7 percentage points from the previous month, while petroleum and natural gas exploration rose 43.9 percent year-on-year, down 10.5 percentage points from June, NBS data revealed.Global Times",SOURCE,ECONOMY,Photo:Xinhua,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'China': ('LOC', 3), 'Russia': ('LOC', 1), 'Ukraine': ('LOC', 1), 'CPI': ('MISC', 4), 'National Bureau of Statistics': ('ORG', 2), 'NBS': ('ORG', 3), 'Everbright Bank': ('ORG', 1), 'Global Times': ('ORG', 1), 'CP': ('ORG', 1), 'COD': ('ORG', 1), 'Wan Jin': ('ORG', 1), 'Department': ('ORG', 1), 'Commission': ('ORG', 1), 'NDRC': ('ORG', 1), 'PPcel': ('ORG', 1), 'PP': ('ORG', 1), 'Dong Lijuan': ('PER', 1), 'Zhou Maohua': ('PER', 1)}"

52,West's incredulity toward US makes propagating China or Russia 'threat' difficult to work,Lu Xue,2022-08-10,"At present, the US is the only country that still wants to use ideology to rule the world, whilst EU countries have lost the intention, determination, and ability to do so. Andrew A. Michta, an US political scientist and expert at the Germany-based George C. Marshall EU Center for Security Studies, attributed the West democracies' ""disadvantage vis-à-vis the Russia-China totalitarian axis"" to the West's ""widespread incredulity about the seriousness of the threat we face [from China and Russia]."" He argued it in the piece entitled ""China, Russia and the West's Crisis of Disbelief,"" which was posted recently in the Wall Streets Journal.Michta's remarks on the ideological division of countries by ""democratic versus totalitarian"" embody a typical Cold War mindset. Although the Cold War has long ended, such a mentality is still spreading amongst some US, said Lü Xiang, a research fellow at the China Academy of Social Sciences.China is also a democratic country, and it is pretty narrow-minded to classify it as ""totalitarian"" just because its development path differs from that of the West. Civilizations in the world have blended and learned from each other. Against this backdrop, it is, in fact, unrealistic to provoke struggles between different civilizations and ideologies.In terms of the West's ""widespread incredulity about the seriousness of the threat"" from China and Russia, it is not hard to understand. The relationship between countries is more of an exchange of interests. No country is willing to sacrifice itself in order to serve the interests of other countries. Great differences of interest exist not only between EU and the US, but also within EU itself. The alliances between some West countries and the US are ultimately for protecting their own interests. When the US chooses to confront China and Russia, it's impossible for EU countries to sacrifice their own interests just in order to remain the alliance system with the US, said Wang Shuo, a professor at the School of International Relations of Beijing Foreign Studies University. According to Lü, the West's ""incredulity"" in regard to the seriousness of threat posed by China and Russia mainly stems from their distrust toward the US. US capabilities are declining. After the end of the Cold War, the US has led NATO to take military actions against countries such as former Yugoslavia, Iraq, and Afghanistan to flex their muscles. The US has had no experience of fighting an armed conflict with another major power since the Cold War. Therefore, its military prestige in fact is actually very limited. No one doubts that China and Russia have huge counterattack capabilities. If EU follows the US in violating the core interests of China and Russia, it will meet strong pushback from China and Russia and the US may not be able to guarantee the security of EU at that time.Although EU is following US in sanctioning and getting tough on Russia, EU differs from the US in their manner toward Moscow. For EU, Russia is a neighbor that cannot be moved away, but that's not the case for the US.The ongoing Ukraine crisis demonstrates that when US leads NATO to provoke Russia, the biggest victim is EU. EU has been severely hit by the spillover effect of the Ukraine crisis - It has to face an energy crisis and soaring prices with key EU countries entering a recession, which may spark political and social instability.China, which lies far away from EU, is the continent's huge market. Some EU enterprises can make even more profits in China than in EU. Therefore, it is quite normal that many EU countries take the ""China threat"" hyped by the US lightly.The West's ""incredulity"" toward the threat from China and Russia can be seen as its own reflections, Lü argued. EU, represented by Germany, has been committed to building stable relations with China and Russia. But this is what the US is reluctant to see. In response, the US has been sowing discord, using issues such as Ukraine to provoke EU's ties with Russia as well as exaggerating the so-called China threat to undermine EU's relationship with China. It is time for EU to reflect how to consolidate EU's internal unity, enhance its autonomy and reduce its reliance on the US.The Joe Biden administration has been stressing West unity, which, however, proved to be profound disunity in the West and within the US. US political division is becoming more evident. How could Joe Biden unite the whole of the West when the US cannot unite itself? Since the Donald Trump administration emphasized ""US First,"" the US' reputation in the West became bankrupt, and especially so when US's purpose to unite the West is to maintain its global hegemony and serve its domestic election agenda. This will only make the West alert.In such a context, propagating the so-called China or Russia threat in the West can hardly have its desired objectives. The more the US views China and Russia as its enemies, the more difficult it is for the US to unite its allies.   The author is a reporter with the Global Times. opinion@globaltimes.com.cn",OPINION,VIEWPOINT,Illustration: Chen Xia/GT,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'US': ('LOC', 10), 'Russia': ('LOC', 6), 'China': ('LOC', 7), 'Beijing': ('LOC', 1), 'Yugoslavia': ('LOC', 1), 'Iraq': ('LOC', 1), 'EU': ('ORG', 4), 'George C.

One version has a billboard with a dumpling pictogram and the line, ""Where are these pierogis?""Observers have been quick to point out that the figures in the original billboard are incorrect: Official statistics show Poland women were having fewer than four children on average during the 1950s.Still, the current birthrate is ­worrisome: With 1.4 children per ­woman, Poland is below the EU average and the threshold of generational renewal.""Our campaign does not have an ideological or political goal,"" said the Kornice foundation whose president, a wealthy entrepreneur with Catholic ties, is one of Poland's richest men.""It simply invites people to reflect.""'Fundamentalist undertone' Kornice had already made headlines for other controversial billboard campaigns, including ones opposing abortion and divorce.For Paulina Zagorska, a women's activist, ""the fundamentalist undertone of these billboards is obvious: Their authors attribute the falling birthrate to contraception and challenges to the traditional family model.""Many observers have seized the occasion to denounce the near-total abortion ban introduced by the right-wing government and to condemn its family policies.According to left-wing opposition Member of the EU Parliament Robert Biedron, ""There aren't enough children because of a shortage of nurseries and kindergartens... insufficient wages... a fear of pregnancy following inhuman anti-abortion laws.""National missionYet the birthrate is one of the key pillars of the ruling party's program, whose staple is a popular monthly child allowance called 500+. The party's family policies are meant to help young households get off the ground and to guarantee childcare during the early years. But critics argue that the policies are mostly designed to benefit the traditional family model and to encourage women to stay at home. The family ministry calls fertility ""a vital issue"" in its official program, adding that it must be defended ""even at the cost of the temporary withdrawal from the labor market of women who prefer to educate their children.""For Irena Kotowska, a demography expert at the Poland Academy of Sciences, these family policies adopted under the influence of the Church have been ""ineffective.""Poland currently numbers 38.2 million people but its population could dwindle by 2.3 million by 2040, according to a ­Eurostat forecast. Historical factorHistoric trends are also affecting the dwindling numbers.""Massive unemployment, brought about by the sudden transition to capitalism, led to falling birthrates in the 1990s in the former Eastern Bloc countries,"" Kotowska said. ""So, there aren't many women of childbearing age from those years, and they don't have a lot of children."" The Czech Republic, another country with a similar historical trajectory, was able to soften the trend ""through progressive politics based on gender equality, institutional support and an adjustment of the labor market.""Kotowska doubts the influx of Ukrainians, mainly women and children, due to the Russia-Ukraine conflict, is enough to ""reverse the population decline.""Perhaps immigration from Africa and the Middle East could have an effect, though she said it was not realistic.

54,"Chinese, Indian observers underscore rebuilding trust as divergences remain despite positive signals in ties",Chen Qingqing,2022-08-10,"With some positive signals emerging in China-India relations, which have encountered severe difficulties following the border dispute since 2020, both China and India observers have acknowledged the importance of rebuilding trust between the two countries, especially when the two sides continued working together in multilateral organizations such as the BRICS and SCO. Still, differences remain in areas such as how to view the border dispute within the bilateral relationship, and how to peacefully coexist in the India Ocean. ""I believe that India has taken a very practical approach to our relations with China. But at the same time, I think none of US have any doubt that there is a lack of trust between two countries, which needs to be repaired, and that can only be done slowly over a period of time, with conversations like this, but also extending to governments,"" Gautam Bambawale, former ambassador of India to China, said during an online video event on Wednesday. ""As far as India is concerned, it is very difficult to divorce the situation on the border from the rest of the relationship. In fact, it will not happen,"" Bambavale said, noting that ""therefore we will have to ensure that there is peace and tranquility on the border if the rest of the relationship has to move ahead, to build further trust and understanding between two countries."" The online event, themed ""China-India: Complex Interdependence in a Rising Asia"", was hosted by the China non-governmental think tank Center for China and Globalization with India think tank Synergia Foundation. Since the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic and border clashes in 2020, China and India have entered a new phase of complex interdependence and mistrust but also deepening and diversifying cooperation.The former diplomat to China laid out ways to rebuild trust. For example, from the perspective of military, he showed the desire for disengagement and de-escalation on the border. ""Events on the border will impact the relationship, and it could deteriorate if we don't work hard together to rebuild the trust that existed before 2020,"" Bambavale said.  The fundamental differences between the two sides on the border dispute have existed for many years, as Indians consider that as long as the dispute isn't solved, other areas of cooperation and the bilateral relationship's development would become meaningless. But China people insist that the border issue should not affect overall bilateral ties, Qian Feng, director of the research department at the National Strategy Institute at Tsinghua University, who was also one of the speakers at the event, told the Global Times on Wednesday. China and India held the 16th commander-level talks in mid-July, the third this year, which marked an overall positive atmosphere between the two neighbors, although some experts believe it will take some time for the two countries to figure out a solution both sides can accept. However, CNN recently reported that the US is to take part in a joint military exercise with India less than 100 kilometers from the Asia country's ""disputed border"" with China. The military drills will be held in mid-October at an altitude of 10,000 feet in Auli in the India state of Uttarakhand and will focus on high-altitude warfare training, CNN said, citing a senior India Army officer with knowledge of the matter.""The drills were pre-planned, but India insisting on doing so amid the deteriorating US-China relationship could send a bad signal for the China-India relationship,"" Qian said. During the online event, some experts also mentioned the economic interdependence of the China and India markets and areas where the two sides could deepen their cooperation such as people exchanges, tourism and services, as well as the digital economy. ""Despite the ups and downs in the bilateral relationship in recent years, I believe India and China can find some common ground in following areas such as trade and investment, as China is the second the largest economy in the world and India is supposed to surpass Japan and become the third largest economy in a decade,"" Wang Huiyao, founder of CCG, told at the event, noting that the two countries could explore the potentials to build up the biggest market in the world. ""China and India have built a strong partnership on AIIB… and not to mention that India is also the co-founder of the New Development Bank, along with China among the BRICS countries,""  he said. ""The two-way trade volume has soared about 43 percent year-on-year, showing the tremendous growth there."" ""The world is still suffering from the pandemic and some countries are battling with high inflation. With all these crises [there is a need] that India and China really [have to] work together,"" he said, noting that the two countries should not decouple as the two largest developing countries share a lot of similarities.But some India experts voiced concerns over the trade deficit. ""There is a serious way of thinking in India that the asymmetric interdependence is in favor of China. So the next steps would be obviously the decoupling process,"" Srikanth Kondapalli, professor at the Jawaharlal Nehru University New Delhi, said at the event. ""That intensified with the Galwan Valley clash in June 2020, and that is where geopolitics enters in economic interdependence.""Zhou Bo, a researcher at the Center for International Security and Strategy at Tsinghua University, also raised a question about how India and China could coexist in the India Ocean by citing the latest example of India's pressure on Sri Lanka to defer the arrival of a China research vessel at a Sri Lankan port, citing so-called national security concerns. ""I agree with the [former] ambassador Bambavale that we have a severe lack of trust, and this actually is also seen most recently in India,"" Zhou noted, referring to India's interference with China ship Yuan Wang 5's docking. ""So India, I believe, would consider the India Ocean very much like India's ocean. But this is not possible,"" he said, noting that if India believes that this is its exclusive sphere of influence, then China's interests would clash with its interests. Some positive signals in the China-India relationship have emerged since the beginning of this year.On Tuesday evening, a chartered plane carrying 107 India businessmen arrived at Hangzhou, China's Zhejiang Province, which is the first charter flight for India businessmen to China. China also started the process for the return of India students stuck back home due to COVID-19 visa restrictions, and the first batch may arrive soon, according to reports from India media outlets on Tuesday. However, in the eyes of China experts, in spite of the enhanced communication against the backdrop of the Ukraine crisis, and the gradual resumption of people-to-people exchanges, China-India ties remain at a relatively low level.""Though the communication has been enhanced amid the Ukraine crisis and the two sides increased the management of the border situation, the official stances of the two countries have been significantly different from each other, and also people-to-people exchanges are still being limited due to COVID-19 restrictions,"" Qian said.",CHINA,SOCIETY,"Screenshot of the online event themed ""China-India: Complex Interdependence in a Rising Asia""","Reporter, Beijing","Chen Qingqing co-leads the Global Times China desk.

56,US' self-serving 'Africa strategy' contradicts the continent's needs,Ma Hanzhi,2022-08-10,"US Secretary of State Antony Blinken gave a speech on the US strategy for sub-Saharan Africa at the University of Pretoria on Monday, on the first leg of his Africa trip. Antony Blinken said the strategy is rooted in ""the recognition that sub-Saharan Africa is a major geopolitical force, one that shaped our past, is shaping our present and will shape our future."" The White House fact sheet claims that the new US strategy is focused on supporting open and transparent societies, democratic governance, economic recovery from COVID-19 pandemic, and efforts to mitigate climate change and expand clean energy. However, the strategy aims to use Africa as a pawn to meet US strategic interests and follow US hegemony under the excuse of enhancing Africa's capacity to solve global problems. Instead of focusing on Africa, the US strategy does its best to discredit China. Behind the strategy is the US belief that China sees Africa as ""an important arena to challenge the so-called rules-based international order."" US points fingers at China when its own policy practice toward Africa meets problems. In recent years, a series of US operations in Africa have seriously harmed the interests of regional countries, leading to a sharp decline in US strategic credibility in the continent. The US strategy for Africa is self-serving and ignores the needs and realities of Africa. In the new strategy, there is only one symbolic reference to the Agenda 2063 which is the most important document for Africa development. The indication of ""US First"" is very strong. For example, the first goal is to ensure the region remains open and accessible to all, and that governments and the public are able to make their own political choices, consistent with international obligations. The logic behind this goal is that Africa is currently occupied exclusively by other powers and the US is marginalized. Therefore, the US demands Africa to open more so it could have the chance to seek hegemony. The second goal is to deliver democratic and security dividends for Africa. The new strategy states that the US can provide Africans with democratic and secure options as they determine their future. Clearly, the US has cast itself as the patron saint of democracy and security in Africa, and other countries as bearing bad intentions. But the fact is that since the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic, violence and terrorism has spread in the Sahel, while the US and the West are retreating. The new strategy calls for a 21st-century US-Africa partnership, but the US seems to be still sleeping in the imperial dream.The new US Africa strategy has taken into account criticism from academic and policy circles about the US' past policies toward the continent. Therefore, it deviates from the old thinking of defining US Africa policy based on specific issues, but views the region from the perspective of serving US global strategy. However, what Africa wants is not to be an important geostrategic participant in US strategy that US desires it to be. The strategic importance that Africa wants is to enhance its representation and voice in the international order, reform the unreasonable and unjust international order, and shift from the marginalized position in the capitalist world economy to truly gain the right to develop on an equal footing with others. These aims, however, are contradictory to the hegemonic interests that the US wants to maintain. What the US wants is to always marginalize the vast number of developing countries in the world so that the US could maintain monopoly. The US' frantic crackdown on China's development is a typical example.The US hopes Africa to be an important part in maintaining US hegemony. But obviously, the continent will not become what US wants it to be. Take the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Africa's stance has annoyed the US and the US' wish to defeat Russia in international public opinion has gone bankrupt in Africa.Africa is the continent of Africans. One must fully understand and respect Africa to gain the trust of the continent. It is unknown how much Africans' opinion has been adopted in the 17-page new US Africa strategy. A document that shouts empty slogans is far from the reality of Africa.The author is an assistant researcher in the Department for Developing Countries at the China Institute for International Studies. opinion@globaltimes.com.cn",OPINION,VIEWPOINT,Illustration: Chen Xia/GT,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'US': ('LOC', 17), 'Africa': ('LOC', 17), 'Pretoria': ('LOC', 1), 'White House': ('LOC', 1), 'China': ('LOC', 3), 'West': ('LOC', 1), 'Antony Blinken': ('PER', 2), 'Saharan': ('MISC', 2), 'COD': ('MISC', 1), '19': ('MISC', 1), 'Agenda 2063': ('MISC', 1), 'Africans': ('MISC', 1), 'University of': ('ORG', 1), 'US First': ('ORG', 1)}"
57,GT Voice: Japan's political speculation is to blame if economic woes worsen,Global Times,2022-08-08,"In pursuit of an economic way out of its current predicament, Japan is facing a crucial choice: whether to jump with both feet onto the US chariot and jointly oppose China, or to adopt a strategy that is in their own interests to minimize the risks for their economy.Japan is running a current account deficit of 132.4 billion yen ($980 million) in June, government data showed on Monday, marking the first monthly deficit since January as surging imports eclipsed exports.The data highlights the widening trade deficit facing the world's third-largest economy this year, in addition to a relatively weak yen, and rising prices. Despite a recent rally, the yen depreciated sharply against the dollar throughout the year to date, at one point hitting a 24-year low of 139.38 per dollar in July.All of these data actually point to the fact that the Japan economy is trapped in a structural vicious cycle. High energy prices and relatively old domestic industries have contributed to trade deficit, which indirectly caused a depreciation of the yen, making the prices of energy products more expensive and leading to more serious trade deficit.The aging population and sluggish domestic demand are the main reasons behind Japan's economic woes, with no effective way out available yet. But it is also important to note that Japan's economic development is heavily dependent on the external environment and conditions. That means if Japan miscalculates in its foreign policy and the international situation, the consequent impact on the Japan economy could be huge, sometimes even fatal. The Japan side has showed deliberate closeness to the US on many issues including the so-called chip alliance issue. At the end of July, the US and Japan agreed to set up a new joint research center for high-tech chips during their so-called economic ""two-plus-two"" ministerial meeting in US, which observers said aims to thwart China's chip ambition, according to Reuters. Japan is a member of the US-led CHIP 4 alliance, compared with South Korea's skepticism and concerns about the group's potential purpose of excluding China. If Japan's economic woes continue to worsen or even lead to a recession, Japan's political speculation should be blamed.Apparently, the Japan political elite are now preoccupied with how to follow the US lead in containing China. However, blindly following a country that puts its own interests first and expressing unnecessary hostility to a neighbor may ultimately cause a backlash that will cause more harm than benefits.Historically speaking, the lesson of the US strangling of Japan semiconductor sector may still be of reference today. If Japan follows the US on the chip supply chain issue, this will likely weaken Japan's own industrial strength given the past experience which showed that US-Japan cooperation often ended up with Japan losing market share to the US. So the Joe Biden administration's proposal of an ideological value-based semiconductor supply chain will only benefit US industry not Japan ones.Moreover, if Japan blindly caters to the unreasonable demands of the US, this will likely be at the expense of cooperation and development between China and Japan. The past several years saw Japan exports of semiconductors, relevant raw materials, electronic parts and equipments to China become a major driving forces for the former's exports. Japan is increasingly reliant on China manufacturing and market when it comes to chip supply chain. If Japan joins forces with the US in containing China, they will suffer huge loss by losing a major export strength.The Japan economy has already taken a hard hit from the Russia-Ukraine conflict, but what has really hurt its long-term economic potential is its dangerous political speculation. Japan needs to consider whether to take the misleading path of the US or to choose a path that is more in line with its interests and the regional stability. To gain more room to maneuver in both political and economic levels to avoid more shocks to its economy, Japan is advised to maintain a rational approach to external affairs wherever possible.",SOURCE,GT VOICE,Illustration: Liu Rui/Global Times,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'Japan': ('LOC', 13), 'US': ('LOC', 6), 'China': ('LOC', 4), 'South Korea': ('LOC', 1)}"

59,"Report on human rights violations in Middle East exposes US' barbarity, cruelty and hypocrisy",Leng Shumei,2022-08-09," The China Society for Human Rights Studies (CSHRS) on Tuesday released a report, revealing a series of crimes committed by the US in the Middle East and surrounding areas that have seriously violated the basic human rights of people and caused permanent damage and irreparable losses to countries and people in the regions. The report, coming ahead of the first anniversary of the US' hasty withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan, which was left with a dire humanitarian crisis, shows that as the nature of US hegemony and the barbarity, cruelty and perniciousness of its power politics have been completely exposed, people of the world would have a better understanding of the hypocrisy and deception of US democracy and US human rights.Titled ""US Commits Serious Crimes of Violating Human Rights in the Middle East and Beyond,"" the report focused on US's systematic violations of human rights, including launching wars, massacring civilians, and damaging the right to life and survival; forced transformation, unilateral sanctions, severe infringement of people's rights to development, life and health; creating a ""clash of civilizations"" and abusing imprisonment and torture, and violating freedom of religion and human dignity. The report said that the US has committed war crimes, crimes against humanity, arbitrary detention, torture of prisoners, and indiscriminate unilateral sanctions in the Middle East and surrounding areas. It is a usual practice of the superpower like US to conduct unilateral cruel actions, including launching wars and imposing sanctions, to deal with its conflicts with foreign countries and regions, Chang Jian, a professor and director of the Center for the Study of Human Rights at Nankai University, told the Global Times on Tuesday.Under the disguise of democracy and human rights, the real intention of the US' cruel actions against foreign countries and regions is purely to serve the interests of its domestic capital groups and its military-industrial complex, Chang noted.Chang's view was supported by Zhu Yongbiao, director of the Center for Afghanistan Studies at Lanzhou University, as Zhu said that the US tried to use its so-called democratic system to reform Afghanistan and abandoned the country when the reform failed, and Afghanistan lost its value, with a total disregard for the most basic humanitarian issues. It further demonstrated that whatever the US does is only intended to serve its own interests, Zhu noted.     The US not only rallied its allies to launch the Gulf War (1990-1991), the Afghanistan War (2001-2021), the Iraq War (2003-2011), and so on, but also was deeply involved in the Libyan War and the Syrian War, creating humanitarian disasters rarely seen in the world. The warmongering US has caused direct, serious and lasting damage to local people's rights to life and survival, the report said.  Nearly one year after US troops' withdrawal, Afghanistan now has the highest number of people in food insecurity in the world, with more than 23 million in need of assistance, and approximately 95 percent of the population having insufficient food, according to the UN website.  Of particular concern is the vulnerability of more than 4 million internally displaced people, including people belonging to minorities, and over 3.5 million seeking refuge in neighboring countries, The US claims that it is the beacon of human rights, but it is actually seriously infringing on Afghan people's rights to life and property. Its protection of human rights is exclusive to a small group of people, and this has also been demonstrated by gross inequalities among different nationalities and the problem of racism within the US, Chang noted. The US is also very good at shifting public attention. Nearly one year after the withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan, the country has successfully shifted the attention of the international community by trying to pass the buck to China and Russia, then fanning the flames of the Russia-Ukraine crisis leading to military conflicts between the two and now provoking on the Taiwan question, observers warned.       What we can do is keep calling for international society to pay attention to the humanitarian crises in Afghanistan as well as in the Middle East, and continue to urge the US to take responsibility, experts said.At the 50th session of the UN held in June, a representative from the China Mission to the UN in Geneva stressed that the US should be held responsible for the current situation in Afghanistan and should take meaningful steps to compensate the Afghan people for their suffering.In February, the Global Times launched an online petition demanding that the US return the life-saving money to Afghans unconditionally after the US released a plan to unfreeze money from Afghanistan's central bank but use it for the US' needs, which irritated the international community. The petition drew more than 420,000 signatures.     Another online poll launched by the Global Times in July asking respondents whether the UN should conduct a field investigation into US human rights violations has drawn more than 50,000 participants as of press time, with over 80 percent supporting the proposition.",CHINA,SOCIETY,US and its allies build a stage for human rights over innocent Afghan lives.

In contradiction, US issued a new Africa strategy document the same day, which urges Africa countries to expose the risks of ""negative activities"" in which China and Russia have engaged in the continent. The US' new strategy document for sub-Saharan Africa issued on Monday said that in line with the 2022 US National Defense Strategy, the Pentagon would engage with Africa partners ""to expose and highlight the risks of negative PRC and Russia activities in Africa,"" stressing the threats posed by China and Russia, Reuters reported.It accused China of seeing the region as ""an important arena to challenge the rules-based international order, advance its own narrow commercial and geopolitical interests, undermine transparency and openness, and weaken US relations with Africa peoples and governments.""Responding to the groundless remarks, China Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said on Tuesday that it does not matter what the US says, but how the Africa people see the China-Africa cooperation. Wang cited a survey conducted by the South Africa Ichikowitz Family Foundation in June over 4,507 young Africans, among which 76 percent named China as the foreign power with a positive influence on their lives, while the figure for the US was 72 percent. ""We suggest that the US heed and respect the will of Africa countries and people,"" Wang said. ""If the US truly wants to help Africa, then it should take concrete actions, instead of using its Africa strategy as a tool to contain and attack other countries.""Detailing the Joe Biden administration's policies for Africa, Antony Blinken said at a speech delivered at the University of Pretoria on Monday, ""It's a strategy that reflects the region's complexity… we can't do any of that if we don't work together as equal partners.""However, South Africa Minister of International Relations Naledi Pandor accused the West of taking a patronizing and bullying attitude toward Africa, VOA News reported on Antony Blinken's first leg of visit to the continent. Pandor made it clear that South Africa has different views from the US on Ukraine, China, and Israel and the Palestinians.The US' emphasis on ""equality"" and ""partnership"" is nothing but a change of its arrogant tone in its policies toward Africa, which shows its eagerness to pull the continent to its side now, He Wenping, a research fellow at the Institute of West Asia and Africa Studies under the China Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times on Tuesday. Africa countries can easily see through these intentions, after all, they had experienced what the Africa proverb called ""when the elephants fight, the grass gets trampled"" during the Cold War, He said.""Antony Blinken claimed in his speech that he would not ask Africa to take sides and would treat Africa as 'an equal partner.' But what is written in the document - accusing China and Russia of posing risks of 'negative activities' in Africa - is self-contradictory. By smearing China and Russia's contribution to Africa's development and highlighting its own 'helpful' role, the US is actually forcing Africa to take sides in its contest with the two countries,"" she said. The document said that US will ""review and reinvest"" in tools for engaging with Africa militaries, especially programs that support necessary institutional capacity-building, combat corruption and advance security sector reforms. But He said it is unlikely the US' new Africa strategy will provide much actual help for Africa's development given that the strategy has little groundbreaking ideas or proposals in the economy and trade fields that can solve the substantial problems facing Africa. ""The objective of Antony Blinken's visit to South Africa is very predictable. The US wants to persuade the Africa continent that China and Russia are Africa's 'biggest enemies.'

61,US to give Ukraine $1b in weapons,Xinhua,2022-08-09,"The administration of US President Joe Biden announced Monday that the US will provide Ukraine with $1 billion worth of additional security assistance, the largest one-time weapons package since the beginning of the Russia-Ukraine conflict.According to a statement by the Department of Defense, the package - the 18th tranche of presidential drawdown since August 2021 - included additional munitions for High Mobility Artillery Rocket System, 75,000 rounds of 155 mm artillery ammunition, 20 mortar systems of 120 mm, and 20,000 rounds of 120 mm mortar ammunition, as well as munitions for National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile System.US will also deliver to Kiev 1,000 Javelins, hundreds of AT4 anti-armor systems, 50 armored medical treatment vehicles, anti-personnel munitions, explosives, demolition munitions and demolition equipment, the statement said.The just announced aid brings total US commitment of security assistance to Ukraine to approximately $9.8 billion since Joe Biden took office, according to the Pentagon. The Ukraine parliament on Monday unveiled a draft law to impose new sanctions on Russia, the Interfax-Ukraine news agency reported.The bill, which was submitted by Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky, envisages 10 new restrictive measures to be introduced against Russia for the next 10 years.In particular, the draft law stipulates a ban on transferring funds from Ukraine to Russia-related individuals and legal entities. Besides, it prohibits Russia-linked individuals from participating in the privatization and lease of Ukraine state property and purchasing land plots in Ukraine. The bill also proposes to ban Russia and Russia-linked ships and planes from entering Ukraine, among other measures.Ukraine and Russia have exchanged accusations over a strike on the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant (NPP), which is one of the largest atomic power complexes in EU and generates a quarter of Ukraine's total electricity.The Russia defense ministry said Monday that Ukraine's shelling of the Zaporizhzhia NPP was an act of ""nuclear terrorism.""As a result of the strike, Ukraine forces damaged a high-voltage line, which supplied electricity to the Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions, it said in a statement.Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Monday that the shelling of the nuclear plant's territory by the Ukraine forces was ""extremely dangerous,"" adding that such actions could lead to ""catastrophic consequences"" for all of EU.Ukraine's state-run nuclear energy operator Energoatom on Sunday accused Russia forces of shelling the power plant, saying the latest rocket attacks on Saturday hit the area next to the plant's dry storage facility, where 174 containers with spent nuclear fuel were stored in the open air.",WORLD,EUROPE,Picture description not found,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'US': ('LOC', 4), 'Ukraine': ('LOC', 15), 'Kiev': ('LOC', 1), 'Zaporizhzhia': ('LOC', 1), 'Joe Biden': ('PER', 2), 'Volodymyr Zelensky': ('PER', 1), 'Dmitry': ('PER', 1), 'Russia': ('MISC', 9), 'High Mobility Artillery Rocket System': ('MISC', 1), 'National Advanced Surface - to - Air Missile System': ('MISC', 1), 'Javelin': ('MISC', 1), 'AT4': ('MISC', 1), 'Department of Defense': ('ORG', 1), 'Pentagon': ('ORG', 1), 'Interfax - Ukraine': ('ORG', 1), 'NPP': ('ORG', 1), 'EU': ('ORG', 2), 'Zaporizhzhi': ('ORG', 1), 'N': ('ORG', 1), 'K': ('ORG', 1), 'Zaporihzhi': ('ORG', 1), 'Klin': ('ORG', 1), 'Pkov': ('ORG', 1)}"
62,Media role to boost BRI cooperation highlighted at Xi'an forum against hegemonic voices,Zhang Han in Xi’an,2022-08-09,"As the world is facing mounting uncertainty and instability, 120 media representatives from more than 40 countries and international organizations attended the semi-virtual 2022 Media Cooperation Forum on Belt and Road on Tuesday in Xi Jinping'an, China's Shaanxi Province, to discuss media's role in enhancing cooperation and development through the vehicle of China-proposed Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) to battle hegemony and confrontational mind-set. Multiple representatives share the consensus that BRI played an important role in connecting different countries and regions and facilitating them to jointly cope with global challenges including the climate change and political instabilities.Huang Kunming, a member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and head of the Publicity Department of the CPC Central Committee, said in his address to the forum that media plays an irreplaceable and important role in disseminating information, enhancing mutual trust and building consensus.Huang expressed the hope that media can inherit and carry forward the Silk Road spirit, actively spread the ideas of equality, mutual learning, dialogue and inclusiveness, and tell vivid stories about jointly building this road of peace, prosperity, openness, greenness, innovation and civilization. The forum was co-hosted by the People's Daily and the Communist Party of China (CPC) Shaanxi Provincial Committee and Shaanxi Provincial Government. Shaanxi is a key region for both the ancient Silk Road and the BRI, and its provincial capital Xi Jinping'an, was an ancient imperial capital and eastern departure point of the Silk Road. The forum also included two sub-forums on regional cooperation under BRI and media dialogue on Global Development Initiative (GDI). Tefera Bekele Daba, vice president of Ethiopian News Agency, pointed out the threats that drought, floods and desertification brought to Africa. Daba proposed the continent should cooperate with other regions and tackle the challenges brought from climate change and realize the development goals that it has, as no place can face global challenges alone.Media is the vehicle to dissolve misunderstandings and promote equality, cooperation, and it also offers the platform for displaying rich fruits of cooperation to battle the mind-set of confrontation and hegemony, several attendees noted. Several guest speakers, including Makhdoom Babar, President and Editor-in-Chief of Pakistan's the Daily Mail, mentioned US and West's sanctions on Xinjiang products, particularly cotton and photovoltaics. Such sanctions were blatant violation of the right to development of not only Xinjiang residents, but also all people who are impacted by a disturbed global supply chain. Representatives urged fairer global governance and louder voices for developing countries amid global challenges brought about by COVID-19 pandemic, the geopolitical crisis including the Russia-Ukraine conflicts and the climate change. The Tuesday forum is the sixth of its kind, which offers a key platform for international media organizations to actively discuss topics on communication, mutual trust and consolidating consensus. Before the forum, China and foreign media representatives formed four groups and visited different cities across Shaanxi to observe regional progress made on digital economy, technological innovation, environmental and ecological protection, culture-featured tourism and many other fields.

63,Guiding Europe to 'rethink' on China-related issues,Lu Shaye,2022-08-09,"
US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ignored repeated warnings from the China side and visited the island of Taiwan. It was a trip of provocation and flames-fanning, exposing to the world the US ill-intentioned attempts of changing the status quo of the Taiwan Straits and hallowing the one-China principle. The G7 and EU did not have the courage to condemn the US, but rather colluded with it to issue a statement which sought to shift the blame for escalating the cross-Straits tensions on China and put ""applicable conditions"" on the one-China principle. All these words have exposed the arrogance and hypocrisy of West countries. In recent years, some EU countries have been constantly changing positions on the Taiwan question. It is especially true when it comes to certain anti-China politicians. On the one hand, those political elites have been influenced, shaped and manipulated by the US for a long period of time. The Ukraine crisis since the beginning of this year has made EU ""vulnerable"" in an unprecedented way, which has also made it easier for the US to ""manipulate EU through Russia."" It has become politically correct for most EU countries to follow the suit of the US and the anti-China political virus has quickly spread to EU. Some EU politicians have since stepped up efforts in playing the Taiwan card to chase their own interests, attract public attention and gamble for votes. On the other hand, the mainstream media and scholars in EU also bear the responsibility for such tactics of manipulating the Taiwan question. Some so-called experts on China and some journalists always play the role of delivering the US stance and observing China through a negative filter. No matter whether it is a major issue or a small one, EU would speak or act in favor of the US while opposing to China whenever it could. In terms of the historical context of the Taiwan question and the fact that the China mainland and the island of Taiwan belong to one China, some people pretend they don't understand or deliberately distort it out of their ideological bias toward China. The political sphere colludes with public opinion and media, which fueled the negative remarks and actions over the Taiwan question. From a boarder and deeper perspective, China-EU relations have entered a historical period of restructuring, and some setbacks are becoming unavoidable. The political consensus between the two sides on the Taiwan question has been affected as well. The essential problem is that some EU countries have severe cognitive distortion. The three definitions of China - a partner for cooperation and negotiation, an economic competitor and a systemic rival - by the EU contradict with each other.The world is changing in an unprecedented way. But some EU countries have not woken up from ""the old dream"" about a West-led world and do not have an objective and rational understanding of China. The EU is walking away from its self-proclaimed strategic independence and is being strategically hijacked by the US hegemony. There are certain groups of people whose mindsets still remain in the last century even though their bodies moved into the 21st century. The spread of information in West society is not as transparent and smooth as it claims. In essence, it is a one-way output dominated by West media and elite groups. Secessionist Democratic Progressive Party authorities have been brainwashing the people in Taiwan with ""Taiwan independence"" and ""de-Sinicization"" ideas. In West society, some people are also brainwashed and thus have a negative understanding about China. To a larger extent, the West has consciously rejected the real situation in China, and has selected, amplified and transmitted negative information about China to their own people. Even positive information would be distorted. Over time, the image of China in the eyes of the EU people has been demonized, which then disturbs normal exchanges and cooperation between the two sides. Once a negative impression is formed, people will intuitively interpret all policies of China from a negative angle. The most important means to expose lies and fallacies and eliminate misunderstandings and prejudices is to strengthen communication. For years, we have strived to introduce a real China to France and to EU society. We fight for our own interests, set things right, make friends and enhance mutual understanding. And we received a lot of support and encouragement. On the Taiwan question, we explain it from the angles of historical context and the international law. We reveal that the history of the island as part of China is much longer than the histories of many EU countries, including France. And we use the example of Corsica as a territorial collectivity of France to guide the public's understanding of the Taiwan question.This is information that the France people do not access from their own media channels. A netizen once left a message on the social media account of the China Embassy in France, saying that he had finally understood what Taiwan means to China, which is just like what Corsica means to France and Catalonia to Spain. We will continue to do this work and actively guide the France and EU people to ""rethink"" on China-related issues. The China is the only legitimate government of China. This is the basic norm governing international relations adopted by the resolution 2758 of the UN of 1971, and it is also the official position of EU countries with diplomatic relations with China, including France. On Pelosi's visit, some France political figures and scholars such as Jean-Luc Mélenchon who leads La France Insoumise (a left-wing political party in France) voiced support for the one-China principle, saying that Taiwan is part of China and condemning Pelosi's provocative and dangerous move. At the same time, some anti-China forces and individuals in certain EU countries are also hyping on the Taiwan question, mulling on challenging China's red line, which deserves our vigilance. The one-China principle is the political foundation of China-EU relations and a red line and bottom line that can't be crossed. We call on EU side not to underestimate the firm will and strong ability of the China government and people to safeguard national sovereignty and territorial integrity, and not to blindly follow the US in playing with fire on the Taiwan question. Instead, they should take concrete actions and stand on the right side of history.As the world's two major powers, markets and civilizations, China and EU share responsibilities in boosting peace and world development, and both should inject stability for the world amid the turbulences. China-France relations are one of the most stable major-power relations in the world today. China, France and EU have a thousand reasons to improve relations, but no reason to damage their ties. We attach importance to the China-France and China-EU relations like we always do. Only by staying true to our original aspiration and making an independent and sober judgment on our own interests, can China-France and China- EU relations continue to develop and correct the course when needed.The author is China's Ambassador to France. opinion@globaltimes.com.cn",OPINION,VIEWPOINT,Photo: GT,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'US House': ('ORG', 1), 'G7': ('ORG', 1), 'EU': ('ORG', 11), 'Nancy Pelosi': ('PER', 1), 'China': ('LOC', 13), 'US': ('LOC', 7), 'Taiwan Straits': ('LOC', 10), 'Ukraine': ('LOC', 1), 'Russia': ('LOC', 1), 'one': ('MISC', 2), 'cross': ('MISC', 1), 'West': ('MISC', 1), 'anti': ('MISC', 2)}"
64,"China, US face 'high risks of miscalculations, crisis' with US' possible more provocative moves over Taiwan amid Biden's 'buck-passing' remarks",Zhang Hui,2022-08-09,"The China People's Liberation Army (PLA) continued its open and transparent military exercises around the island of Taiwan on Tuesday, after US President Joe Biden's ""buck-passing"" comments that he was concerned about China's military drills. China analysts said the Joe Biden administration has dodged the root cause for the escalated tensions in the Taiwan Straits and does not consider thoroughly the consequences of its reckless moves, which is the most fatal flaw in Joe Biden's China policy. China analysts warned that cross-Straits and China-US relations face growing uncertainty and instability with possible more radical moves by the US in supporting Taiwan secessionist forces through more arms sales and military training, as well as inciting more West politicians to visit the island. China and the US are facing high risks of miscalculation and even crisis since multiple bilateral communication channels have been canceled. As for US military's possible move to send warships through the Taiwan Straits, China analysts said that it was more of a ""symbolic and cheap"" move to pacify US politicians, Taiwan secessionists and anti-China forces who feel upset since the US military has not taken any practical moves over China's countermeasures, but the PLA has fully prepared no matter how the US will flex its muscles. On Monday, Joe Biden in his first public comments on the Taiwan question since Pelosi's visit claimed that he was not worried about Taiwan but was concerned about China's military exercises. ""I'm concerned they are moving as much as they are,"" Joe Biden told reporters in Delaware. ""But I don't think they're going to do anything more than they are,"" Reuters reported. CNBC said Joe Biden's remarks reflect a broader opinion within the Joe Biden administration that Beijing does not intend to ""invade Taiwan,"" ""as least not in the near term.""This was echoed by US Under Secretary of Defense for Policy Colin Kahl who said the US still believed it was unlikely ""China would try retake Taiwan militarily in the next few years,"" according to Reuters. Yang Xiyu, a senior fellow with the China Institute of International Studies, told the Global Times that Joe Biden has deliberately criticized China's moves but avoided talking about what triggered them.  Following the Joe Biden administration's frequent buck-passing tricks, China Vice Foreign Minister Ma Zhaoxu said on Tuesday that the US should shoulder its international responsibility and obligations, and not make excuses for its mistakes.And the so-called broader opinion within the Joe Biden administration that China may not solve the Taiwan question with force in next few years indicates that the US may not plan to challenge China's sovereignty through dangerous moves in the near future, at least not before Joe Biden's first term ends in 2024, as the Joe Biden administration knows clearly that whether the PLA will be forced to take action is directly related to whether the US will stir up tension in the Taiwan Straits, Yang said. However, several China analysts believe that the US will not drop its Taiwan card, instead it will create more crises by supporting Taiwan secessionist forces militarily and politically. Yang said China and the US will face more confrontations over the Taiwan question, and the US is likely to speed up arms sales to the Taiwan authorities and enhance military training and intelligence sharing with Taiwan military. ""The US is moving its tools used in Ukraine since 2014 to the island of Taiwan to push forward its false claim of 'today's Ukraine is tomorrow's Taiwan,'"" Yang said. The US has also publicly smeared China's moves in the Taiwan Straits and compared it with Russia's military operation against Ukraine. In response, Ma said on Tuesday that the US' claim has ulterior motives, and the Taiwan question is completely China's internal affair and different from the Ukraine issue. He said the US has a habit of stirring things up.Analysts said China-US relations have entered a dangerously unstable period with risks of miscalculations and crises running high. A Beijing-based foreign affairs expert who requested anonymity told the Global Times that the US will take more risky moves for sure on its China policy, but neither Joe Biden nor Congress thought thoroughly about the consequences, and this is the most fatal flaw for Joe Biden's China policy. He said with the US moving further on the dangerous path over the Taiwan question, the international community will be more deeply aware that the one-China principle is the international consensus and the cornerstone of the stability of the global order. If it is undermined, the global order will be in a state of crisis, he said. Drills continueThe PLA Eastern Theater Command continued its realistic combat-oriented joint exercises in the sea and air space around the island of Taiwan on Tuesday, with the focus being joint blockades and joint support operations, the PLA Eastern Theater Command announced on the day.The Navy sent destroyers and frigates, and the Air Force sent early warning aircraft, fighter jets, aerial tankers and electronic warfare aircraft for the drills, focusing on maintaining air superiority, aerial refueling and maritime support and honing the capabilities of joint blockade under complex electromagnetic environment, the PLA Eastern Theater Command said.J-16 fighter jets and a YU-20 aerial tanker were seen in a video released by the PLA Eastern Theater Command.From day one to Tuesday, the PLA has practiced capabilities like land-based, sea-based and air-based long-range precision strikes as well as seizing air superiority and control of the sea including air combat, sea assault and anti-submarine warfare. With the drills around Taiwan expected to become routine, experts reached by the Global Times believe the PLA to practice and hone more of its capabilities, including those involving amphibious landing and aircraft carriers.The Type 075 amphibious assault ship Guangxi attached to the PLA Eastern Theater Command Navy recently carried out a number of training exercises including integration with helicopters, maneuvering in formation and replenishment at sea across multiple sea regions, the PLA East Sea Fleet announced on Monday in a press release.Amphibious landing forces like the Type 075 amphibious assault ship and the Type 071 amphibious landing ship could join the drills around Taiwan island soon, analysts said.Neither of the PLA's aircraft carriers, the Liaoning and the Shandong, has been featured in official reports on drills around the Taiwan island as of yet, despite experts affiliated with the PLA telling the Global Times that an aircraft carrier group will join the drills.Aircraft carriers are expected to deter and cut off routes of external force interference from the east side of Taiwan island, while also joining the attack on the island, experts said.US warships coming?The PLA drills' focus on joint blockade on Tuesday came after the US reiterated on Monday that it will continue to send warships through the Taiwan Straits despite the PLA drills.""The US Navy is expected to conduct some freedom of navigation operations in the region in the coming days,"" the website of the US Naval Institute USNI News quoted Colin Kahl as saying during a press briefing on Monday.Now that the PLA has extended its drills around the island of Taiwan without giving a conclusion date, plus China's cancelation of theater commanders' talks, defense policy coordination talks and military maritime consultative agreement meetings with the US as countermeasures in response to Pelosi's provocative Taiwan visit, questions have been raised over the US' decision to insist on sending warships through the Taiwan Straits.In June, the China Foreign Ministry stressed that China has sovereignty, sovereign rights and jurisdiction over the Taiwan Straits. This means if US warships or warplanes want to pass the Taiwan Straits, they must not carry out any provocative activity, Song Zhongping, a China mainland military expert and TV commentator, told the Global Times.But transits of US military vessels and aircraft in the Taiwan Straits are always sensitive. It is difficult not to think the US is intentionally making provocations particularly under the current situation, analysts said.The PLA can set new navigation restriction zones amid its consecutive exercises around Taiwan island, and this will deny US warships from entering the Taiwan Straits from a tactical level, Song said.At a time when three major China-US military and defense talks have been canceled, if the US insists on sending warships through the Taiwan Straits where the PLA is holding drills clearly aimed to deter US interference, the risk of an accidental conflict is high, analysts said.The US must realize the PLA will not give in an inch when it comes to safeguarding national sovereignty, security, and the major core interests like the Taiwan question, Song said.",CHINA,DIPLOMACY,"A YU-20 aerial tanker of the Chinese People's Liberation Army Eastern Theater Command Air Force takes off for a joint blockade mission around the island of Taiwan on August 9, 2022.

66,US' new Africa strategy likely to bring the continent back to Cold War,Song Wei,2022-08-08,"As the Joe Biden Administration is about to unveil a new Africa strategy, senior US diplomats are paying visits to Africa. Following US Representative to the UN (UN) Linda Thomas-Greenfield's visit to the continent, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken arrived in South Africa on Sunday to kick off a three-country tour. Since the end of World War II, the US has placed Africa as at the bottom of its global strategy. Although the US diplomatic emphasis on Africa has grown now, it only attempts to bring the Cold War to Africa once again, ruining Africa's development prospects.In the political realm, some Africa countries are forced by US to take sides. During her visit to Africa, Thomas-Greenfield criticised that the Russia-Ukraine conflict has added to the food crisis in the continent, ""especially since some countries in Africa once got up to 75 percent of their wheat from Russia and Ukraine."" Asked by Africa reporters whether the US will sanction Africa countries that have economic relations with Russia,Thomas-Greenfield warned Africa ""countries should not engage with countries that have been sanctioned by the US,"" laying bare the US government's coercion and hegemony.In the economic field, the US is fanning all-round competition with China. After the end of the Cold War, the US decided to withdraw from the Africa market, believing that the return on investment was too low to attract US companies. In the past two decades, with the active promotion of the ""Forum on China-Africa Cooperation"" and the ""Belt and Road Initiative,"" China enterprises have become an important force in promoting industrialization and modernization in Africa. This has led the US to re-examine the Africa market from a ""competitive"" perspective. Antony Blinken is reportedly to mobilize US private companies and US banks to jointly invest in Africa, accelerating competition with China in the continent.In the field of ideology, the US has vigorously promoted US values. The visit of the two leading US diplomats this time demonstrates the strategic intention of the US to promote US values in Africa. For instance, Antony Blinken reportedly will meet with senior government officials and representatives of civil organizations during his visit to the Democratic Republic of the Congo to discuss how to ensure ""free, fair and inclusive elections in 2023.""The new version of the US' Africa strategy is about to be announced. Although it reflects a shift of the US' diplomatic efforts to Africa to a certain extent, it is by no means a blessing for Africa and the continent's future development. As predicted by some West think tanks, many Africa countries have put a question mark on the motives of the US government to engage with Africa again. Bringing Africa to the path of confrontation or a new Cold War will undoubtedly lead to a disaster in the continent. Only through returning to multilateralism and win-win cooperation can Africa achieve the goals set in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.The author is professor with School of International Relations and Diplomacy, Beijing Foreign Studies University. bizopinion@globaltimes.com.cn",SOURCE,ECONOMY,Illustration: Xia Qing/Global Times,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'Joe': ('PER', 1), 'Linda Thomas - Greenfield': ('PER', 3), 'Antony Blinken': ('PER', 3), 'Thomas - Greenfield': ('PER', 3), 'Biden Administration': ('ORG', 1), 'UN': ('ORG', 2), 'Forum': ('ORG', 1), 'Cooperation': ('ORG', 1), 'Belt and Road Initiative': ('ORG', 1), 'US': ('LOC', 22), 'South Africa': ('LOC', 20), 'Russia': ('LOC', 3), 'Ukraine': ('LOC', 2), 'China': ('LOC', 3), 'Republic': ('LOC', 1), 'Congo': ('LOC', 1), 'World War II': ('MISC', 1), 'Cold War': ('MISC', 2), 'on China - Africa': ('MISC', 1), 'Democratic': ('MISC', 1)}"
67,Pelosi's Taiwan trip fuels new global turmoil,Wang Wen,2022-08-08,"In disregard of China's strong opposition and solemn representations, as well as the discouragement of many international mainstream media outlets and political dignitaries out of good intentions, US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi stubbornly carried out her visit to the island of Taiwan. This trip has seriously violated the basic norms of international law established by the UN Charter, gravely reneged on US commitments made in the three China-US joint communiqués and the one-China principle, which are the political foundation of China-US relations. It's also a serious violation of China's sovereignty and territorial integrity, greatly undermining peace and stability across the Taiwan Straits. After instigating the Ukraine crisis, the US has attempted to incite conflicts across the Taiwan Straits, which has fueled a new round of global turbulences in the West Pacific region.Pelosi is the Speaker of the US House of Representatives and third most senior political figure of the US. Her official foreign trips represent the US' exercise of its diplomatic power. This time, Pelosi's visit to Singapore, Japan and South Korea can be called ""state visits,"" but a trip to the island of Taiwan without China's permission trampled on China's sovereignty, and it is also a violation of the principles of sovereign equality and territorial integrity stipulated by the UN Charter. The China central government has repeatedly stated at the UN that there is only one China in the world, Taiwan is a part of China, and the government of the PRC is the sole legitimate government representing the entire China. At present, this statement is a political reality recognized by the 181 countries that have established diplomatic relations with China and accounts for about 93.7 percent of UN member states. It also represents the basic principles that most of the countries in the world must abide by in their official dealings with China.  In the 1972 Shanghai Communiqué, the Joint Communiqué on the Establishment of Diplomatic Relations between the China and the US of US in 1978 and the Joint Communiqué of the China and the US of US (August 17, 1982), both the China and US governments clearly emphasize the adherence to the one-China principle. The three joint communiqués establish the political foundation for the normalization of China-US relations over the past half century, and are regarded as the code of conduct and cooperation norms to measure the diplomatic behaviors of the two countries. As one of the main leaders of the US, Pelosi's visit to the Taiwan island obviously constitutes a violation of the norms of international law recognized by both China and the US. It also betrays the political commitments the US has made to China. Pelosi's Taiwan trip and support to the island echoed Joe Biden's previous pledges at multiple occasions to defend Taiwan, which has sent a serious wrong signal to Taiwan secessionists and further aggravated cross-Straits tensions as well as the deterioration of China-US relations. The China mainland has always been willing to strive for peaceful reunification with the greatest sincerity, patience, and effort. But in order to defend national sovereignty and territorial integrity, it has conducted the most intensive live-fire military exercises in six zones around the Taiwan island since the end of World War II, with the purpose of deterring the interference of external forces and the conspiracy of Taiwan secessionists. Meanwhile, the China government has taken eight countermeasures against the US and sanctioned Pelosi and her immediate family members. The US is the instigator of the negative situation that continues the downward spiral of US-China relations, and Pelosi's trip to Taiwan is the new trigger.Many scholars, media and social organizations in most countries across the world have publicly criticized Pelosi. Her ""symbolic visit"" will not bring any prospect of security and prosperity to Taiwan, but will only lead to strong defensive military countermeasures by the China mainland.  Pelosi's Taiwan trip has further exposed the US' offshore balancing strategy in Eurasia. The US incited the Russia-Ukraine conflict in early 2022, forming turmoil in the West of the Eurasian continent in which Ukraine is used to check Russia while Russia is used to pressure EU. The purpose of Pelosi's visit to Taiwan this time was to intensify conflicts across the Straits, spark military tension in the West Pacific region, and try to induce new turmoil in the east of the Eurasian continent. The US aims at achieving a new equilibrium in which the Taiwan island is used to check the mainland, whilst China's reactions subsequently put pressure on Japan, South Korea, Australia and India. If East Asia is plunged into new chaos, the US, far from Eurasia, can exploit the situation to maintain its already crumbling global hegemony and renew its status as the world's only superpower that is now increasingly heading for an end.Obviously, in order to confront Russia and China, two strong Eurasian powers, the US is constructing an ""arc zone"" to promote a new containment strategy against China and Russia based on alliances. This strategy of suppressing emerging powers is bound to meet resistance and pushback, leading to new major power security dilemmas. This will cause the most intense major power competition and global turmoil in two directions of the Eurasian continent since the end of World War II. It will undoubtedly see the world plagued even more by economic recession, raging pandemics, a food crisis.The author is Executive Dean of Chongyang Institute for Financial Studies, Renmin University of China, Executive Director and a Distinguished Professor of China-US People-to-People Exchange Research Center. opinion@globaltimes.com.cn",OPINION,VIEWPOINT,Illustration: Chen Xia/GT,Author title not found,Wang Wen is professor and executive dean of Chongyang Institute for Financial Studies at Renmin University of China.,"{'China': ('LOC', 18), 'US': ('LOC', 12), 'Taiwan Straits': ('LOC', 5), 'Ukraine': ('LOC', 1), 'West Pacific': ('LOC', 1), 'Singapore': ('LOC', 1), 'Japan': ('LOC', 1), 'South Korea': ('LOC', 1), 'PRC': ('LOC', 1), 'Shanghai': ('LOC', 1), 'US House': ('ORG', 1), 'UN': ('ORG', 4), 'US House of Representatives': ('ORG', 1), 'Nancy Pelosi': ('PER', 3), 'Charter': ('MISC', 2), 'one': ('MISC', 1)}"
68,Taiwan Straits crisis shows US' inability to conduct coherent foreign policy,Andrey Kortunov,2022-08-08,"The distance from Russia to Taiwan island amounts to more than 7,000 kilometers - not exactly what you would call a nearby neighborhood. Still, the recent US-China crisis over the Taiwan question has inspired a lot of passionate discussions in the Russia capital, like in many other capitals around the world. What might happen to the volatile security environment in the Taiwan Straits? Should we continue to consider a large-scale military conflict in East Asia only a hypothetical scenario or has it already become a visible possibility looming on the horizon? There is no apparent consensus in Moscow on what would serve Russia's interests better - further escalation, or rather de-escalation of the crisis. The arguments of many champions of escalation can be condensed to three major points:First, since the US is perceived as the main challenge to Russia's security and even to its mere existence, it is nice to see the US getting into trouble elsewhere. The crisis around Taiwan Straits speaks volumes about the inability of US to conduct a coherent foreign policy. The longer the crisis lasts, the more damage it is likely to inflict upon US positions in the region and the more it will erode the global US leadership.Second, if the China-US relations continue to sour, the value of Moscow in Beijing's eyes is likely to increase. More than ever before, China will need a reliable strategic partner in Eurasia in order to focus on US, which views China as a strategic adversary. That implies more political, military, economic and technological China-Russia cooperation.Third, with the current crisis in East Asia unraveling, the international community might shift its attention from Ukraine to the Taiwan question. Not that this will necessarily change the West attitudes toward the Russia-Ukraine conflict, but this conflict will no longer remain the only game in town. Since economically Taiwan island is more important than Ukraine, in Moscow they can hope that the West will start gradually easing its current economic, diplomatic and military pressure on the Kremlin. These arguments may look cynical, but they are not devoid of any logic. However, champions of de-escalation have their own line of reasoning that deserves to be briefly presented here. First, a further escalation of the crisis over the Taiwan question would have grave implications for the world economy, including a likely global recession coming already this year and extending to 2023. This would undoubtedly affect all of Russia's prime trading partners, starting with, but not limited to China. The Russia economic difficulties, as significant as it is in 2022, will turn even deeper. Second, an extended full-fledged deadlock in US-China relations on top of the ongoing fierce confrontation between Russia and the West is likely to mean the end of the modern world order, universal multilateral organizations and fundamentals of international public law. We are likely to see permanent instability and even chaos in world politics, which will serve no one's interests, including Russia's.Third, a prolonged stalemate between Beijing and US might sooner or later slide into a direct military confrontation. Though Russia is not close to Taiwan Straits, any conflict in East Asia will have a spillover impact on people in the rest of the world.I personally tend to believe that the logic of those who stand for de-escalation is more compelling than the logic of escalation supporters. The last thing that all of US need now is a new cycle of escalation between two great powers. As an Englishman would say, ""A lean peace is better than a fat victory."" I wish China has a lot of strategic patience, stamina and state wisdom in dealing with increasingly inconsistent and unpredictable US. The author is a director general of the Russia International Affairs Council. opinion@globaltimes.com.cn",OPINION,VIEWPOINT,"The air force and naval aviation corps of the Eastern Theater Command of the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) fly warplanes to conduct operations around the Taiwan Island, Aug. 4, 2022.

71,West needs to get up early to compete with China in environmental technologies: former UN undersecretary-general,Global Times,2022-08-07,"Editor's Note: During the past decade, the world has increasingly witnessed a trend of ""the East is rising, and the West is declining"" in the spheres of economy, security and discourse power. West countries, particularly the US, plagued by internal woes, have sought the old path of passing the buck and instigating turmoil elsewhere to ease their own pressure. China, representative of the emerging countries, is proposing new solutions to global problems. By advocating win-win development, facilitating consultation and reconciliation and proposing a balanced and effective security mechanism, China is striving to build a community with a shared future for mankind.In the ninth piece of the series, Erik Solheim (Solheim), former undersecretary-general of the UN and former executive director of the UN Environment Programme, told Global Times (Global Times) reporter Li Aixin that the progress on air pollution in China, compared internationally, is incredible. He stressed no one should blame China for the climate crisis and Westerners should be a little bit less arrogant.

Photo: unep.orgGT: About a decade ago, pollution was bad in China. US Embassy in Beijing even released unofficial hourly PM2.5 readings. Now blue skies are back. Reports show the concentration of PM2.5 decreased 63 percent in Beijing over the past years. How do you think China has achieved it? Solheim: The progress on air pollution in China, compared internationally, is absolutely incredible. China has reduced air pollution in seven years as much as we have done in EU and North US in 30 years. This is absolutely remarkable and positive. I believe it happened because this was a major demand of the China people. The message was accepted by the country's political leadership. They decided to act and they acted very determinedly. That's why we're seeing pollution coming down that fast.  It's not just air pollution by the way, but also water pollution too. In places such as Zhejiang Province, south of Shanghai, there have been fantastic progresses on river pollution. There used to be rivers once called milky rivers because they were white from pollution. Now they are so clean. You can send a two-year-old into the river for a bath with no problem.The incredible progress on water management in Zhejiang is so visible. Very beautiful housing projects come up, with temples, tourists, and the beauty of the nature, turning around which was so polluted into so positive. That made a very strong impression on me.If you look at Inner Mongolia, China is first class in fighting desertification, greening of the land. There are also so many new national parks. I visited one national park in Sichuan Province where they use high tech to improve the protection of pandas. China is moving very fast on pollution control, and also on protection of nature. There are now fishing bans on the upper reaches of the Yellow River and the upper Yangtze River. This will be short-term pain for people around these rivers. But in the long run, their ecosystems will restore and fish will return in abundance. Everyone will see the wisdom of doing this. Global Times: There has been a buzzword coined by China leadership called ""ecological civilization."" What are your understanding and views on ""ecological civilization?"" Solheim: It's a great concept. It is a new way of thinking about the environment. The old way was to avoid the negatives. Environment was about protection against the negatives. US president Richard Nixon established the Environmental Protection Agency in the US, to stop pollution and stop the negatives. Ecological civilization, however, is about the positive, enormous progress for humans where they can live in a society which is much more environmentally friendly. It's integrating the human aspect, the natural aspects, and technological aspects into one - creating an ecological civilization, which could unify humanity in the 21st century. Global Times: Quite recently, you tweeted about China's offshore wind capacity and hydropower. Among renewable energy sources, what are the unique values of hydropower and offshore wind capacity? And are there any other fields in environmental protection, in which China is also taking the lead?Solheim: We need to move very fast on all renewable resources, solar, hydropower, all of them. And China is now the leading nation in every single green technology. 80 percent of all solar panels were made in the very last year (in China), 60 percent all solar power on the grid, 80 percent of hydro, 80 percent of wind, and 70 percent of all electric batteries, just to give a few numbers. So frankly, we, in the West, need to get up early in the morning and compete with China in these technological areas. That will be good for humanity because competition will drive a far faster and more positive change. China is in the lead. Hydro is essential because it is a good environmentally friendly technology by itself. It can also function as a battery. The sun is not shining all the time, the wind is not blowing all the time, but you can turn on and off hydropower at a very rapid speed. So, it can function as a battery for other technologies. I think it's well known to many that China is leading on environment technologies. But China is also in the lead on innovative practices for the environment, like desert control, green cities, and creating a huge number of national parks and protected areas. China has pledged to plant and conserve 70 billion trees by 2030. That's an amazing promise. I'm sure China will also deliver upon this promise. Global Times: In international public opinion, China's effort in environmental protection is somehow twisted or criticized for political reasons. For example, West media outlets are generally reluctant to touch upon per capita greenhouse gas emissions. Some even say that China's love for meat is threatening the environment. What's your take on these voices? Solheim: Frankly, Westerners should be a little bit less arrogant. US emissions per capita, from the beginning of carbon emissions up to today, are about 8 times China emissions per capita, and is, by the way, 25 times that of India emissions per capita. In Glasgow, some even blamed India for the carbon crisis. No one should blame China or India for the climate crisis. The crisis is mainly caused by the West. But emissions are also coming up fast in China. China is not acting on climate because of the West. China is doing this for its own sake. We are all in this together. We should stop blaming each other, and find all the areas where we can work together. Because fighting climate change is in the interest of the people of China, the US, and all EU nations. It is in the common interest of humanity.Global Times: How do you view the US' previous departure from the Paris Climate Agreement? What impact will politicization of global environmental protection have?Solheim: Interestingly, when the US made this mistake of withdrawing from the Paris Climate Agreement, it had a limited impact on US emissions, for a simple reason that US businesses want to move ahead reducing emissions. They have invested in a lot of renewables, much less than that of China, but are still moving in the right direction. But to make politics out of this is very bad. We should use political means to control climate emissions but we should avoid any sort of political conflicts. It seems now to be an opportunity in the US. If President Joe Biden will get the climate package through Congress, that would be a very positive development. But on that basis, the US should be encouraged to work very closely with China to curb emissions. We should see climate and environment as one common platform for avoiding conflicts in other areas. Global Times: According to reports, Germany is planning to revise a key climate target to reach greenhouse gas emissions neutrality in the country's energy industry by 2035. The US Supreme Court limits federal power to curb carbon emissions. Against the backdrop of an energy crisis, where is the trend headed?Solheim: In the short term, there may be problems coming for renewable energy from the war in Ukraine, because people will employ a little bit more coal, oil, and gas in the short term. In the long term, I think the result is to supercharge a renewable revolution. In EU we want to be less dependent on Russia oil and gas. What can EU do? Well, the sun is EU, there is EU wind and EU water resources. All those resources are domestic, and it will make EU a lot more independent. Even nations like China, India, Brazil and South Africa, which do not support a boycott on Russia, they do not want to be dependent on a volatile and vulnerable oil market. In these nations, renewables are more affordable domestic resources, compared to oil and gas. Again, it makes so much sense to focus on solar, wind and hydro. I think we will see a supercharging of a renewable revolution. Global Times: Japan regulators recently approved the release of Fukushima's nuclear-contaminated water into the sea. In this regard, do you think West countries have shown some double standards? What commitment needs to be made to the international community before the dumping of the water?  Solheim: I think the most important demand, if a nation does something like this, is to consult very closely with all those neighbors or nations who may be affected by the release. In the case of Japan, consultations with China, South Korea and other neighbors may be critical. I do not know how powerful this release is. I visited Fukushima a year after the accident. There were no deaths immediately from the nuclear accident. But 20,000 Japan died from the tsunami, which was caused by the earthquake in the sea outside Japan. In a way, the accident also illustrated the primacy of climate protection, because the vast majority of the Japan died from the natural catastrophe not from any nuclear spills.But I will encourage Japan and every other nation that if they want to do something like this, please consult your neighbors.",OPINION,VIEWPOINT,Photo: VCG,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'East': ('LOC', 1), 'West': ('LOC', 2), 'China': ('LOC', 9), 'Beijing': ('LOC', 2), 'North US': ('LOC', 3), 'Zjiang Province': ('LOC', 2), 'Shanghai': ('LOC', 1), 'Erik Solheim': ('PER', 2), 'Li Aixin': ('PER', 1), 'Sol': ('PER', 1), 'UN': ('ORG', 1), 'UN Environment Programme': ('ORG', 2), 'Global Times': ('ORG', 2), 'EU': ('ORG', 1), 'Western': ('MISC', 1)}"
72,Congress is destabilizing an already erratic US foreign policy,Bradley Blankenship,2022-08-07,"US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi touched down in Taiwan island on the evening of August 2, sparking international outrage and plunging US-China relations to an all-time low. China media is awash with understandable anger over the situation while US media has largely downplayed the visit, blaming Beijing for any escalations. The incongruence in the perception of this event by both countries' media more or less follows the same pattern of how Pelosi's office, and surely Congress in general, saw the event: Just a political stunt and nothing more. In US politics, such provocative and extravagant events are commonplace. In just a few months, Pelosi's Democratic Party will face the fight of its political life as it tries desperately to cling to narrow margins in both chambers of Congress. Losing the majority in the House, for example, would dethrone Pelosi as the speaker and cause her to lose any political clout.In order to get ahead, politicians in the US do whatever they can to grab headlines. And in fact, there's an old saying that any publicity is good publicity. So as long as people are talking about Pelosi and the Democratic Party, they can stay relevant and hopefully boost their credibility to voters in November.There's also a symbolic factor here, too. The administration of President Joe Biden has sought to make US competition with adversaries around the world a game of good versus evil, or, in his parlance, democracy versus autocracy. That's why any action that stands up to China, a so-called autocracy per the official narrative, is seen as a holy action and of serious symbolic importance.Pelosi's trip, to her, was both an impactful political stunt and a symbolic victory. But undoubtedly, it was a strategic loss for the US itself. Even though the US media is painting the situation as China being the aggressor, the rest of the world clearly sees the US as a harbinger of chaos. There is a multitude of ongoing political issues around the world right now, including the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, the situation regarding Iran's nuclear program, the perennial Israel-Palestine conflict, the conflict in Syria, the conflict in Yemen, and many more you could think of. But there is one common denominator in all that I've just listed: US. Should a conflict erupt over Taiwan in Asia because of Pelosi, this would be completely on-brand for the US and what it represents.In addition, we can see that it demonstrates a consistent dysfunction of US politics. Now, to be fair, the US Constitution does grant certain foreign policy powers to each branch of government - at least in principle. In practice, however, the executive branch has consolidated a pretty much near limitless hold over foreign policy matters. That Congress can have such an outsized influence on foreign policy undermines established political norms within the US.To be sure, there is some precedent here. During the administration of former president Barack Obama, many Congressional Republicans tried to undermine his administration's foreign policy. Senator Lindsey Graham and now-deceased Senator John McCain traveled extensively to conflict zones, like Syria and Ukraine, and urged pro-US forces to continue their fights - painting the administration's support for their cause as not sufficient. Republicans also notably invited former Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to speak to Congress, and thus to the US people, about Iran's nuclear program despite no invite from the White House. This was a major slap in the face to the executive branch's authority.Still, Pelosi's visit goes a step above this. It directly undermined the political foundations of the most important relationship in global politics, namely the US-China relationship. China's understandable reaction to Pelosi's treachery means that the chances of a miscalculation that could potentially lead to outright war between the two leading superpowers undermines global security. However, make no mistake: This is all Pelosi's fault. Not content with being so broken that undermines the very well-being of its citizens, the US Congress is now destabilizing an already unpredictable US foreign policy. That is a deeply worrying prospect for international diplomacy. The author is a Prague-based US journalist, columnist and political commentator. opinion@globaltimes.com.cn",OPINION,VIEWPOINT,Illustration: Chen Xia/GT,Author title not found,"Bradley Blankenship is a Prague-based American journalist, columnist and political                    commentator.","{'US House': ('ORG', 2), 'Congress': ('ORG', 2), 'Democratic Party': ('ORG', 2), 'Nancy Pelosi': ('PER', 6), 'Joe Biden': ('PER', 1), 'Taiwan': ('LOC', 2), 'US': ('LOC', 9), 'China': ('LOC', 4), 'Beijing': ('LOC', 1), 'Ukraine': ('LOC', 1), 'Iran': ('LOC', 1), 'Israel': ('LOC', 1), 'Palestine': ('LOC', 1), 'Syria': ('LOC', 1), 'Yemen': ('LOC', 1), 'Asia': ('LOC', 1)}"
73,"China's foreign trade expands 16.6% in July, bucking slowdown fears",Ma Jingjing and Qi Xijia,2022-08-07,"China's foreign trade maintained double-digit growth in July at 16.6 percent year-on-year, official data showed on Sunday, underscoring the resilience of China's giant export machine and bucking market fears of a slowdown due to cooling global consumer demand amid high inflation as well as growing geopolitical uncertainties.Experts noted that the strong performance of China's imports and exports will inject momentum into the country's economic recovery in the second half of the year, while easing market concerns over a global economic recession.According to data released by the General Administration of Customs (GAC) on Sunday, the country's foreign trade totaled 3.81 trillion yuan ($563.5 billion) in July, an increase of 16.6 percent on a yearly basis.In the first seven months, the country's foreign trade volume reached 23.6 trillion yuan, an increase of 10.4 percent year-on-year, faster than the growth rate of 9.4 percent seen in the first half of the year, according to the GAC.""The better-than-expected data reflects that the pent-up growth momentum is being released throughout the year after the fallout of COVID-19 resurgence in spring was overcome,"" Bai Ming, deputy director of the International Market Research Institute at the China Academy of International Trade and Economic Cooperation, told the Global Times on Sunday.Bai said that a raft of measures, including special relief for small and medium-sized enterprises and tax reductions, as well as the depreciation of the China yuan and a significant drop in shipping costs, contributed to the accelerated growth in July.The steady throughput growth among China ports also underlies the sound rebound in the country's foreign trade sector. According to data from the China Ports and Harbours Association, the container throughput of eight coastal container hub ports increased by 12.7 percent year-on-year in July, while the Shanghai port and the Ningbo-Zhoushan port - two of the country's largest ports - saw their container throughput up 16.8 percent and 25 percent year-on-year, respectively.Between January and July, China's trade with its top three trading partners - ASEAN, the EU, and the US - grew 13.2 percent, 8.9 percent, and 11.8 percent year-on-year, respectively. Trade with Belt and Road partners jumped COVID-19.8 percent year-on-year, while that with the 14 Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) economies was up 7.5 percent from January to July, according to the GAC.The robust growth in China's trade with these countries and regions is a slap in the face to some West media that have claimed that overseas demand for China products will decline in the second half as COVID-19 pandemic continues and major economies stall, experts noted.In July, China's exports increased 23.9 percent year-on-year to 2.25 trillion yuan, while imports rose 7.4 percent year-on-year to 1.56 trillion yuan. The trade surplus expanded 90.9 percent year-on-year, hovering at a high level.Zhou Maohua, a macroeconomic analyst at Everbright Bank, told the Global Times that domestic enterprises' imports are affected by high energy and commodity prices, as the domestic economy continues to recover, while global economic uncertainties are also affecting their confidence.Tian Yun, a Beijing-based economist, told the Global Times on Sunday that the large trade surplus also indicates that the severity of global inflation and supply shortage caused by the Russia-Ukraine conflict, West sanctions and the global supply chain restructuring has gone beyond expectations.""If the trend continues, the foreign trade sector may drive up China's GDP growth rate by 1 percentage point,"" Tian said. Looking ahead, Bai said that the possibility of the US lifting some tariffs imposed on China exports and the dividends brought by the RCEP will continue to add momentum to China's foreign trade in the second half of the year.However, rising uncertainties and challenges such as economic contraction in EU and the US as well as rising competition from Southeast Asia countries like Vietnam could add pressure to China's exports, he said.Amid the ongoing uncertainty, China will implement a series of measures to stabilize and improve the quality of foreign trade in the second half of the year to consolidate its resilience, Shu Jueting, a spokesperson for the Ministry of Commerce, said at a recent press briefing.Officials will work to guide foreign trade firms to explore and expand the international market, and the country will continue to organize international exhibitions, such as the China International Import Expo and the China Import and Export Fair, and encourage localities and industrial associations to hold online exhibitions, she said.",SOURCE,ECONOMY,"Containers are loaded on barges at a port in Jiaxing, East China's Zhejiang Province on June 16, 2022.

74,"China frequently introduces historical context and the merits of Taiwan question to the world, reinforces 'one-China principle' as internationally recognized consensus",Yang Sheng,2022-08-07,"As China military forces have been conducting massive drills around the island of Taiwan  in response  to the serious provocations made by the US on the Taiwan question in recent days, China diplomats around the globe are also make great efforts to introduce the historical context and the merit of the Taiwan question to reinforce the one-China principle as an international consensus. This is to let the world understand how the tensions emerged and why the US is one who provoked first, and to let the world be prepared to understand the national reunification of China which will be realized one day in the near future. After US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's provocative trip to Taiwan, the vast majority of the international community has showed their supportive attitudes or voices of understanding to China's legitimate countermeasures toward the US and the Taiwan secessionist authorities, with more than 160 countries speaking up for justice, condemning the Pelosi visit as a serious, reckless and irresponsible provocation and expressed their commitment to the one-China principle and support for China's efforts to uphold sovereignty and territorial integrity, according to the China Foreign Ministry.But the US and a handful of its allies are still trying to make use of the US hegemonic advantage in the field of international public opinion to distort, misinterpret and weaken the one-China principle as a international consensus, so it is very necessary and important for China to keep telling the world about the truth of the Taiwan question, said analysts. By doing so, the US will have no chance to demonize China's national reunification process, and even if China has to reunify the island of Taiwan and safeguard its sovereignty by force one day as a result of the provocations made by US or the Taiwan authorities, the mainstream of the international community will keep their supportive and understanding attitudes toward China, experts noted.Telling the truthChinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi held a press conference for China and foreign media in Phnom Penh, Cambodia on Friday afternoon after attending the meetings of foreign ministers on East Asia cooperation.""I would like to expound on China's position on the Taiwan question. Considering that the US side has just spread a lot of false information and untrue words in this regard, it is even more necessary for US to clarify the facts and set the record straight,"" said Wang.Responding to the US claim that China has changed the status quo across the Taiwan Straits, Wang said it is nothing but a rumor and slander. Taiwan has never been a country. There is only one China, and both sides of the Taiwan Straits belong to one and the same China. This has been the status quo of Taiwan since ancient times.The China-US Joint Communiqué on the Establishment of Diplomatic Relations issued in 1978, the second one of the three China-US joint communiqués, clearly emphasizes that the government of the China (PRC) is the sole legal government representing the whole of China and Taiwan is part of China, which has been the status quo across the Taiwan Straits for decades, Wang noted.But such status quo has indeed been broken. The destroyer is not China, but the US and Taiwan separatist forces, Wang said. ""In 2000, the US side placed its unilaterally concocted 'Taiwan Relations Act' ahead of the three China-US joint communiqués. Isn't that changing the status quo? A few years ago, the US side brazenly put the so-called 'Six Assurances,' which was kept in secrecy, into its one-China policy statement. Isn't that changing the status quo? Isn't it hollowing out the one-China policy?"" Wang asked.The countries which have established diplomatic ties with China all respect the one-China principle, but the US is the one that insists the ""strategic ambiguity"" to acknowledge the three joint communiqués on the one hand to keep benefiting from China-US ties since 1970s, but on the other hand keep undermining the one-China principle by supporting the Taiwan secessionist authorities with political encouragement and arms sales to interrupt China's national reunification process, experts said.  China Ambassador to the US Qin Gang published an article entitled ""Why China objects to Pelosi's visit to Taiwan"" in the US Post on Thursday, to explain China's position and the historical context of the Taiwan question to the US public. It is very necessary for China diplomats to make such efforts, because the Taiwan question is so complicated that many people around the world, including many government officials, are still not clear, or even confused, about the situation, Xin Qiang, deputy director of the Center for US Studies at Fudan University, told the Global Times on Sunday.Many people do not understand or at best have only a limited understanding of the history of the Taiwan question, the development of cross-Straits relations, and even the serious consequences of Pelosi's visit to the island of Taiwan, Xin noted.Many West media, when talking about the Taiwan question, have always avoided  telling the world about what the ""one-China principle"" is, what promises the US had made to China when the two countries established formal diplomatic ties and how the US broke its promises to interrupt China's efforts to reunify the island peacefully. And they also try not to tell the facts about how the secessionist Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) ruined the trend of joint economic development and integration between the two sides of the Taiwan Straits, and how the DPP authorities poisoned the atmosphere for cross-Straits cooperation and exchanges with their efforts to promote anti-China education and propaganda within the island in the past few years, especially their moves involving the Hong Kong turmoil in 2019 and spreading hatred against the China mainland after COVID-19 pandemic, said experts.But there are also many foreigners, even in the West world, making their voices of justice heard recently regarding the Taiwan question. Roger Waters, co-founder of Pink Floyd, an English rock band formed in London in 1965, refuted the wrong narrative about Taiwan question in an interview with CNN on Sunday.When CNN host Michael Smerconish said in the interview that ""China is too busy encircling Taiwan…"" Waters immediately said, ""They're not encircling Taiwan, Taiwan is part of China, and that's been absolutely accepted by the whole of the international community since 1948 [sic], and if you don't know that, you're not reading enough. Go and read about it.""When Smerconish tried to interrupt Waters by saying that when talking about human rights, ""on the top of the list of offenders are China."" Waters also immediately refuted that ""China didn't go to Iraq and killed 1 million people in 2003.""Analysts said that people like Waters with knowledge about the fact of history who are able to think independently are brave to speak out loud for China. Unfortunately, the mainstream media of the West and West governments won't let their voices dominate public opinion, and some West governments and media will keep using rumors and lies to dominate the narrative to keep demonizing and stigmatizing China. It will take a long time to let the voice of justice fix the West public opinion field which now has been hijacked by problematic ""political correctness.""  Prepare for reunification Not only is Ambassador Qin Gang is making  efforts to communicate with US public on the Taiwan question, China ambassadors all around the globe have actively given media interviews or published articles in local mainstream media including newspapers and TV stations since August 2, the day Pelosi's plane landed on the island of Taiwan. Some of them firmly refuted the irresponsible statements made by some West countries to smear and demonize China's legitimate, reasonable and lawful responses and countermeasures, some of them patiently explain and introduce to the foreigners who do not understand the background of the Taiwan question or those who want to know why the China people are so angry about the US provocations or why the national reunification of China is a must and an unchallengeable goal shared by all China people.    Li Fei, a professor from the Taiwan Research Institute at Xiamen University, told the Global Times on Sunday that the US is now setting a trap for China － just like what it did to Russia on the Ukraine crisis － it is trying hard to provoke China on its core interests, in the hope that China would overreact to US provocations without preparation. However, China is much wiser and more patient than US had expected because of China's confidence in its strength, so China uses the US mistake to further improve its preparations for national reunification, Li said. ""The PLA is undertaking unprecedented military exercises to gain more experience. The China diplomats and media are also using the chance to brief and explain to the world why the Taiwan question is so sensitive and why the national reunification is a must for China.""One day in the future, with continuous diplomatic efforts to reinforce the one-China principle as an international consensus, even if the US and Taiwan secessionists provoke again and China has to launch military operations to solve the Taiwan question once and for all, the international community will keep supporting and respecting the one-China principle, and the collateral damage and the cost of the reunification by force will also be minimized, analysts said.",CHINA,DIPLOMACY,"The air force and naval aviation corps of the Eastern Theater Command of the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) fly warplanes to conduct operations around the Taiwan Island, Aug. 4, 2022.

75,"Blinken kicks off trip to Africa, 'unable to form a new Cold War club' to counter Russia, China",GT staff reporters,2022-08-07,"US Secretary of State Antony Blinken arrived in South Africa on Sunday, beginning his trip to Africa that is widely described by the US media outlets as a renewed effort to bring back allies and a revival of Cold War-style politics. Although in an attempt to counter the influence of China and Russia, the US is unable to form a new club to achieve its goal of containing the two countries, considering the significant cooperation between China and Africa and Russia's deep engagement with the region, analysts said. Besides, Africa countries like South Africa, which still have fresh memories of the Cold War and focus more on their domestic issues like economic recovery, are expected to adopt a more balanced and pragmatic stance by avoiding picking a side between major powers, they noted.Antony Blinken is expected to deliver a major speech on Monday on US strategy toward sub-Saharan Africa, according to US media reports. This is the second visit of the top US diplomat to the region following his trip to Kenya, Nigeria and Senegal in November 2021, and it is considered as ""playing catch-up"" to counter the growing influence of Russia and China in the region. Antony Blinken's trip comes on the heels of that of Russia Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov's trip to the region, who just wrapped up a visit to Egypt, Ethiopia, Uganda and the Republic of Congo. ""We're back to Cold War-style strategic diplomacy,"" in which superpowers try to convince Africa countries that their narrative is the right one, and vie for their support, The New York Times reported on Sunday, citing analysts.During the Cold War period, the West and the Soviet Union tried to gain allies or proxies in the developing world, and Africa economic and political development was hindered as a result, the US media said. Since US President Joe Biden took office in January 2021, he appeared to adopt some measures in correcting the disdainful attitude of his predecessor toward Africa, vowing to work together with Africa countries and expressing mutual respect as well as solidarity. While the White House announced in July it will hold a major summit for leaders from across the continent in December, the administration is poised to unveil a new strategy on the continent, aiming at reviving US engagement and competing with China and Russia, US media reported. Antony Blinken will launch the US strategy for sub-Saharan Africa and lead a US delegation to the US-South Africa Strategic Dialogue, Ned Price, US Department of State spokesperson, said in a tweet on Sunday. Although South Africa has close ties with West countries like the US and the UK, it is unrealistic to expect the Africa country to become a new part of the US-led West's ""friends circle"" to counter China, Huang Lizhi, lecturer from School of Africa Studies with the Beijing Foreign Studies University, told the Global Times on Sunday. ""South Africa has multi-dimensions in its identity. It has a long history of engaging with the US and the UK, leaving positive or negative legacies. At the same time, the country is also one of the major emerging countries, keeping active interaction with China and being an important part of BRICS,"" Huang said.On whether South Africa would face any political pressure over its close partnership with China and Russia, Siyabonga Cwele, Ambassador of South Africa to China, told the Global Times in an exclusive interview in June that South Africa pursues an independent foreign policy.  ""Our approach is that we believe in peace, we believe in resolving any conflict through peaceful means, and we believe in the supremacy of the UN system, which is governing all of US through agreed rules that we should all respect,"" he said, adding that BRICS countries have common ideas about focusing on peace and growth.Climate change, the food crisis and health will be topics of discussion for Antony Blinken's meeting on Monday with his South Africa counterpart Naledi Pandor, according to media reports. In response to some media reports which speculated whether Africa countries, such as South Africa, will ""condemn"" Russia's military operation in Ukraine, some China experts said rather than taking sides between major powers, Africa countries care much more about solving their own problems. ""Africa is facing three major crises - the food crisis, financial crisis and energy crisis. Lavrov recently affirmed Russia grain exports to the continent, and that is what Africa needs,"" He Wenping, director of the Africa Studies Section at the Institute of West Asia and Africa Studies under the China Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times on Sunday. Africa countries uphold diplomatic approaches based on their own interests, she said. Experts noted that as the governing Africa National Congress members will choose their party leader and hence the presidential nominee in December, the major focus of the political elites in South Africa will be on domestic issues and economic recovery.""Also, many South Africa politicians still have a fresh memory about the impact of the Cold War, which makes them understand that they need pragmatic positions in face of major powers,"" Huang said.",CHINA,DIPLOMACY,"US Secretary of State Antony Blinken arrives at Lanseria International Airport in Johannesburg on August 7, 2022.",Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'US': ('LOC', 14), 'South Africa': ('LOC', 12), 'China': ('LOC', 4), 'Russia': ('LOC', 5), 'Kenya': ('LOC', 1), 'Nigeria': ('LOC', 1), 'Senegal': ('LOC', 1), 'Egypt': ('LOC', 1), 'Ethiopia': ('LOC', 1), 'Uganda': ('LOC', 1), 'Republic of Congo': ('LOC', 1), 'West': ('LOC', 1), 'Soviet Union': ('LOC', 1), 'Antony Blinken': ('PER', 4), 'Sergey Lavrov': ('PER', 1), 'Joe Biden': ('PER', 1), 'Price': ('PER', 1), 'Cold War': ('MISC', 4), 'Saharan': ('MISC', 2), 'The New York Times': ('ORG', 1), 'House': ('ORG', 1), 'Department': ('ORG', 1)}"
76,"Root of the grave, urgent nuclear proliferation situation lies in US",Global Times,2022-08-07," With the 10th Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) being held at the UN headquarters in New York from August 1 to 26, the issue of nuclear non-proliferation has once again become the focus of global attention. US today doesn't let go of any occasion that can be exploited to smear and contain China. A US representative on Thursday at the NPT Review Conference baselessly criticized China for accelerating the expansion of its nuclear arsenal. And the US side also accused China of not engaging in talks on new arms control framework. China has lashed out at the rhetoric.""By making such groundless accusations, US wants to deflect blame, distract attention and shun US' due responsibility in securing global nuclear safety. US hopes this way can constrain the improvement of its main competitor's nuclear capabilities,"" Su Hao, founding director of the Center for Strategic and Peace Studies at the China Foreign Affairs University, told the Global Times.China has always kept the quantity and size of its armed forces at the minimum level necessary for maintaining national security. China's nuclear strategy focuses on self-defense, and aims to ensure the strategic security of the country by deterring the potential threat or use of nuclear weapons by others against China. And China has never taken part and will never take part in any nuclear arms race. US's rhetoric is totally irrational.In fact, the country that has blatantly violated the nuclear non-proliferation agreement is the US. China Ambassador for Disarmament Affairs Li Song on Friday blasted the US for its negative moves on disarmament. He told a committee meeting of 10th NPT Review Conference that Driven by the Cold War mentality, the US has been obsessed with major-power strategic competition and has sought absolute strategic advantage, strengthened military alliances, stirred up bloc confrontation on the eastern and West sides of the Eurasia continent, and pressed ahead with the forward deployment of nuclear missiles and other strategic forces.The landscape on international security is deteriorating and the risk of nuclear proliferation is growing. The responsibility lies with the US. The US-led NATO's continuous eastern expansion triggered the military clash between Russia and Ukraine, with no sign of easing up to now. In the Asia-Pacific region, US has provoked China's national security in a high-profile manner for several times, in an attempt to contain China. US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's visit to the island of Taiwan is the latest example, which has ramped up the cross-Straits tensions.Meanwhile, the US, which has the largest and most advanced nuclear arsenal, plans to spend over $1 trillion to maintain and modernize its nuclear triad. Furthermore, US withdrew from the Anti-Ballistic Missile and the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces treaties successively. President Joe Biden stepped back from a campaign promise that the sole purpose of nuclear weapons should be to deter nuclear attacks. All these moves may result in nuclear proliferation globally.According to Song Zhongping, a China mainland military expert and TV commentator, the US has always adopted double standards on nuclear non-proliferation. As one of the first countries to call for a nuclear non-proliferation treaty, the US is constantly setting rules on the nuclear non-proliferation to deter other countries, especially its rivals, from developing nuclear capabilities. But ironically, the US itself does not abide by these treaties and rules at all. For example, under AUKUS, the US and the UK are anticipated to assist Australia to have nuclear-powered submarines, which has severely violated the principles of the NPT. The US should not always give the green light to itself and the red light to others on this issue, as such a practice will lead to nuclear proliferation and arms race.The biggest crisis confronted by the nuclear non-proliferation mechanism is that because of US' double standards, distrust among countries has been rising. As a result, an increasing number of countries do not believe in the restraint mechanism brought by the NPT. It can be concluded that the root of the grave and urgent nuclear proliferation situation lies in the US. The US-led global governance mechanism is disabled in nuclear non-proliferation. ""This is because this mechanism is a unilateral, selfish, narrow-minded, bloc-political governance, to serve the US in maintaining its global hegemony. Such a global governance system will only lead the international community more tense and turbulent,"" noted Su.""The nuclear non-proliferation advocated by the US is entirely out of its geopolitical consideration. US's hegemonic mindset increases the difficulty of achieving true nuclear non-proliferation. The US must take the lead in implementing the NPT; otherwise, nuclear non-proliferation cannot become a reality,"" said Song.China has always advocated building a community with a shared future for mankind. Only if the international community, including the US, can consider the nuclear non-proliferation from this perspective will such a crucial international problem be addressed.",OPINION,OBSERVER,US nuclear power Illustration: Liu Rui/GT,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'10th Review Conference of': ('MISC', 1), 'Parties to': ('MISC', 1), 'Treaty on the Non - Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons': ('MISC', 1), 'NPT': ('MISC', 1), 'NPT Review Conference': ('MISC', 3), 'Di': ('MISC', 1), 'Cold War': ('MISC', 1), 'UN': ('ORG', 1), 'Center for Strategic and Peace Studies': ('ORG', 1), 'China Foreign Affairs University': ('ORG', 1), 'Global Times': ('ORG', 1), 'NATO': ('ORG', 1), 'New York': ('LOC', 1), 'US': ('LOC', 14), 'China': ('LOC', 11), 'West': ('LOC', 1), 'E': ('LOC', 1), 'Russia': ('LOC', 1), 'Ukraine': ('LOC', 1), 'Asia': ('LOC', 1), 'Pacific': ('LOC', 1), 'Su Hao': ('PER', 1), 'Li Song': ('PER', 1)}"
77,"US receives limited endorsements from allies on its groundless accusation against China on Taiwan Straits tension, proving one-China principle a strong international consensus",Yang Sheng,2022-08-06,"The US is trying to piece together its limited influence to gather endorsements from its allies to follow its stance on condemning China's legitimate military actions around the island of Taiwan recently in responding to US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's provocative trip to the island. Only a few US allies like Japan and Australia have remained in lockstep with US's stance closely on Saturday, and other countries, whether EU major powers or US key ally in the region like South Korea, are being far more restrained as some only expressed ""concerns over tension"" or just urged ""deescalating the tension"" without condemning China's countermeasures, while China has already received support from more than 160 countries in regard to its legitimate response in safeguarding its sovereignty, and the vast majority of members of the international community are condemning or expressing concern regarding Pelosi's provocative and irresponsible visit that threatens and harms the world peace.China analysts said this has proved USs further shrinking global influence following the outbreak of Russia-Ukraine conflict in February this year when the US marshalled the West world to sanction Russia. The US has united even fewer countries to join its provocation and condemnation against China on the current Taiwan Straits tension this time, because the one-China principle is an unshakable international consensus, and the world is sick of US double-standards on ""sovereignty and territorial integrity"" when handling different matters. On Saturday, US Secretary of State Antony J. Antony Blinken, Australia Foreign Minister Penny Wong, and Japan Foreign Minister Hayashi Yoshimasa met in Phnom Penh on the margins of the ASEAN Foreign Ministers' Meeting. The top diplomats of the three countries expressed their concern about ""the China's (PRC) recent actions that gravely affect international peace and stability, including the use of large-scale military exercises. They condemned the PRC's launch of ballistic missiles"" and ""urged the PRC to immediately cease the military exercises.""  Analysts said this tone is more provocative than the previous G7 statement and is also more hostile than the stance held by the EU and major EU countries which just expressed ""concerns,"" and the three countries' top diplomats have totally turned a blind eye to the Pelosi's visit which is the root reason of the current tension. For instance, Germany Foreign Ministry spokesman Christofer Burger called for ""de-escalation in the region, stressing that disputes should be resolved peacefully and by mutual agreement of all sides,"" without any condemnation, and Germany deputy government spokesman Wolfgang Buchner told a news conference in Berlin that Germany remains committed to 'one China' policy.Although Germany is a G7 member, its stance, especially when Germany officials make their own statements, is at least more neutral and nuanced than the G7 statement which was actually produced under the US influence and pressure, according to a Beijing-based expert on international relations who asked for anonymity.Similarly, South Korea Foreign Minister Park Jin on Friday expressed ""concerns over rising tensions surrounding Taiwan."" While South Korea supports the ""one China policy,"" Park said it is important to maintain peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait given its strategic importance of security and economy, Yonhap News reported.Hua Chunying, a spokesperson for the China Foreign Ministry, said at a routine press conference on Friday that ""in the wake of Pelosi's visit to Taiwan, over 160 countries have spoken up for justice, condemned the visit as a serious, reckless and irresponsible provocation and expressed their commitment to the one-China principle and support for China's efforts to uphold sovereignty and territorial integrity.""

China announces eight countermeasures in response to Pelosi's Taiwan island visit. Graphic:Global Times Wang Yiwei, director of the Institute of International Affairs at the Renmin University of China, told the Global Times on Saturday that the reactions from the international community has proved that most countries around the globe can see the fact clearly that it was the US which was undermining the UN-centered international order.The UN adopted Resolution 2758 in 1971, which decides to restore the lawful rights of the China (PRC) in the UN and to recognize the representatives of the PRC government as the only legitimate representatives of China to the UN.""The one-China principle has already become the internationally recognized consensus. Through Pelosi's visit to the island, the US, some of its allies and the secessionist Taiwan authorities are openly challenging the core spirit of the UN Resolution 2758, and they even used the 'democracy' as pretext to justify their violation of the international consensus and UN resolution,"" Wang said. This is yet more proof of power politics played by the US, because in this case, the US has no respect for China's sovereignty, and many developing countries share China's feeling because they know how dangerous could be if the world allowed the US to use ""democracy and freedom"" to interference other countries' internal affairs, and how hypocritical the US is in playing double-standard on the sovereignty, Wang noted.The Malaysian Prime Minister's Special Envoy to China released a statement urging West nations to desist with practicing double standards by trying to compare Taiwan with Ukraine or trying to encircle Russia and call for respect for Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity on one hand while meddling in China's internal affairs and intending to use Taiwan to divide China on the other. This would be using democracy as a pretext to interfere in and infringe upon China's sovereignty in violation of basic principles of international law.Lü Xiang, an expert on US studies at the China Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times that ""It's interesting that when reporting or analyzing the current Taiwan Straits tension caused by Pelosi's visit, most US media and scholars are being very careful, as they avoid talking about 'sovereignty,' a term they frequently used on the Ukraine crisis.""  The US is trying to weaken or distort the international consensus of the one-China principle based on its hegemonic interests, so that one day it could openly separate Taiwan island from China, but such attempt is doomed to fail, because of China's growing strength and the unshakable international order with the UN at its core, said analysts. ""Many West countries, even some G7 members, have actually been forced by the US to take a position on the matter, as they don't want to get involved and impact their ties with China."" Now they have seen China's strong countermeasures and sanctions on Pelosi from all aspects, this will make them remain more rational and to keep distance with the US hostile stance against China, Lü said.Considering the current mainstream attitudes and voices across the international community, China analysts believe that the US cannot fool every nation and can't even keep the West countries to follow it closely on Taiwan question, especially when the tension is in fact caused by the provocation made by the US side, and if one day, China is forced by the US to solve Taiwan question once and for all, to use military means to safeguard its sovereignty and territorial integrity, China will have the supports and understanding from the vast majority of the international community.",CHINA,DIPLOMACY,"The army of the Eastern Theater Command of the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) conducts long-range live-fire drills in the Taiwan Strait, Aug. 4, 2022.

78,Pelosi’s visit has been a big loss for Taiwan: former US Marine Corps intelligence officer,Global Times,2022-08-05,"Editor's Note:US Speaker of the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi's visit to Taiwan island, despite strong opposition from China, has escalated regional tension, plunged China-US relations to new lows and damaged US' own interests. How has this visit influenced the island of Taiwan and the cross-Straits situation? Will the possibility of a war between China and the US in the Taiwan Straits increase in the next few years? Global Times (Global Times) reporter Yu Jincui talked with Scott Ritter (Ritter), a former US Marine Corps intelligence officer, over these issues. Global Times: After Nancy Pelosi's Taiwan visit, there is a view that the provocative trip is a ""win"" for her but there are no benefits to US interests. What's your take on her trip? Ritter: US interests, in terms of foreign and national security policy, are not the prerogative of the Speaker of the House of Representatives. Pelosi, like other senior members of Congress from both chambers, are consulted on critical issues, and of course Congress is empowered to hold hearings during which it can ask questions of administration officials. Congress also has the power of the purse — control of the budget — which can be used to influence policy. But in the end, it is the President who is the ultimate decision-maker regarding policy formulation and implementation and, as such, the ultimate arbiter as to what constitutes ""the national interest."" Seen in this light, Pelosi's trip did not conform to existing State Department policy positions, was deemed disruptive by the Department of Defense, and was practically disavowed by the White House. Pelosi was very much a rogue agent, and as such her visit was not in line with US interests. Moreover, given the harsh reaction from China, it is difficult to articulate a case where Pelosi's visit could be construed as serving US interests. Global Times: What does Pelosi's visit actually mean and bring to Taiwan?Ritter: Taiwan must certainly recognize the reality that any effort to seek independence from China is fantasy which, if acted on, would trigger forcible reunification through military means. Pelosi's visit was an exercise in moving the US away from its confusing policy of strategic ambiguity when it comes to the defense of Taiwan island, and as such a weakening of the fundamental precepts which sustain the one-China policy, namely that Taiwan will never be independent. By hosting Pelosi, Taiwan sent a clear signal that it supported this revamping of US policy and, by extension, was seeking to move closer to independence. China's response makes it clear that ""Taiwan independence"" will never be accepted. Given the military and economic pressure being brought on Taiwan because of Pelosi's visit, it is impossible to conclude anything other than that Pelosi's visit has been a big loss for Taiwan. Global Times: Beijing announced six large maritime areas and their air space surrounding the island of Taiwan to facilitate live-fire military drills from Thursday to Sunday. How do you interpret the response? What messages does it send out? Ritter: Despite its anger at Pelosi's visit to Taiwan, Beijing still places the peaceful reunification policy above any forceful reintegration through military means. However, it is critical that a signal be sent to Taiwan that under no circumstances will any political movement toward independence be tolerated. China must make it clear to Taiwan island what the consequences of any effort to gain independence would be, namely military intervention. If the threat of the use of military force is to have any deterrent value, it must be seen as real. China's live-fire military exercises are meant to demonstrate to Taiwan the seriousness China attaches to the issue of ""Taiwan independence.""Global Times: Only a few months after the Russia-Ukraine conflict broke out, the US escalated its conflict with another great power, China. Has the US taken a path of strategic adventurism? Ritter: US' reliance on ""escalating confrontation"" in its policy with China predates the Russia-Ukraine conflict and is representative of a policy ""pivot"" undertaken back in 2021 by the Joe Biden administration. The Joe Biden administration has never been able to fully articulate the goals and objectives of this policy pivot. Moreover, given the distractions created by the Afghanistan debacle and domestic policy crises, implementation of what passes for a China policy has been uniformly uneven. China has outmaneuvered the US consistently in terms of military power projection (the China Sea islands), and economic growth (the success of the Belt and Road Initiative, and the creation of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership in place of the failed Trans-Pacific Partnership). The US has always relied upon its military strength in the Pacific region as the foundation upon which its geopolitical posture rested. Given the inability of the Joe Biden administration to implement a consistent economic policy posture in the Pacific to counter China, the US has fallen back on its military as a platform to project an image of strength. What is seen as an ""escalation"" by China reflects policy weakness of the US. Indeed, one of the reasons why Nancy Pelosi could implement her rogue Taiwan mission was because when it comes to China policy, the Joe Biden administration is trapped in a sea of chaos and incompetence. Seen in this light, it is difficult to speak of a ""strategy"" at all.Global Times: You gave a three out of 10 in a previous Global Times interview regarding the possibility of a China-US war over the Taiwan question. In view of Pelosi's trip, has the possibility of a war between China and the US in the Taiwan Straits increased in the next few years?Ritter: Pelosi's visit to Taiwan will have a meaningful impact on US-China policy, having set in motion a trajectory which pushes the US away from its ""one China"" policy toward a position which views 'Taiwan independence' as a viable objective. It is impossible to say precisely when, or under what circumstances the final articulation of this policy change will be formally announced, but there should be no doubt in China that this is the direction the US is headed. The key question is whether China can prevail on Taiwan not to take US' bait, and instead remain focused on achieving a peaceful reunification. Void of a major shift in internal political opinion in Taiwan, however, the impetus toward independence will gain momentum, making a conflict between the China mainland and Taiwan all but inevitable. The key question is, what will the US do in the case of any large-scale conflict between the mainland and Taiwan? This, in large part, depends on the scope, scale, and pace of any such confrontation. Simply put, the faster the mainland can resolve any conflict with Taiwan, the less likely the US would be able to respond militarily. In any event, the seeming inevitability of a future cross-Straits conflict makes the possibility of a US-China military confrontation a distinct possibility.",OPINION,VIEWPOINT,Suicidal mission.

81,"Russian soft drinks maker targets 50% of market to fill gap left by Coke, Pepsi",Reuters,2022-08-04,"As the world's biggest soft drinks makers cut their Russia ties, local producer Chernogolovka is aiming for a 50 percent share of the country's near $9 billion market, its boss told Reuters.A mass exodus of West firms due to sanctions and restrictions over Russia's actions in Ukraine has created an unexpected opportunity for Russia businesses and entrepreneurs.Chernogolovka, named after the town outside Moscow where it was founded in 1998, makes snacks, bottled water, lemonades, energy drinks and, since May, Cola Chernogolovka.The privately owned company is more than doubling its business this year, its CEO Natalia Sakhnina said in an interview, and expects to reach a 30 percent market share within two years, up from around 8.5 percent at the end of 2021.""We were, are and will be the main Russia producer of drinks,"" Sakhnina said. ""We hope for and are working on gaining absolute leadership in the Russia market.""Revenue in Russia's non-alcoholic drinks market totals $8.8 billion, according to data provider Statista.Although fizzy drinks made by Coca-Cola and Pepsi Co are still available in Russia, they are set to disappear over time as existing stocks are run down, leaving local manufacturers to step in.Pepsi Co suspended soda production and sales in Russia in March, one of many West consumer brands to curtail operations after Russia sent troops into Ukraine. Coca-Cola also suspended operations in March. In June, it said bottler Coca-Cola HBC AG and its existing customers in Russia were depleting stock.Chernogolovka has almost doubled volume in the southern city of Krasnodar and increased capacity by 50 percent in Siberia's Novosibirsk so far in 2022 when compared to 2021, Sakhnina said.New cola brandsNewly launched cola brands, including Chernogolovka's and competitor Ochakovo's CoolCola, jumped to a 5 percent share of sales in the category in the first half of 2022, NielsenIQ Russia said.""Our company was not present in the cola segment,"" Sakhnina said of an area that accounts for around 50 percent of the market.""This year we entered this segment and this coincided with international players in this flavor leaving. So if we evaluate our prospects and ambitions, they are almost limitless.""To meet the anticipated rise in demand, Chernogolovka is building a 40,000 square meter production plant in the town. The facility will cost over 3 billion roubles ($50 million) and its first stage is set for completion in March 2023.Some additional demand has come from fast food outlets.Chernogolovka started supplying soft drinks to the Russia outlets of Burger King and KFC in April. It is in talks to do the same for Vkusno & tochka, the renamed chain of McDonald's restaurants that opened after the world's largest fast-food chain sold to a local licensee, Sakhnina said.Vkusno & tochka is looking for a new drinks provider, as Coca-Cola is depleting its Russia stock, Chief Executive Oleg Paroev told Reuters in June. ""We are currently considering options, choosing a supplier that according to taste will suit our guests the most,"" a Vkusno & tochka spokesperson said on Wednesday, when asked about any talks with Chernogolovka.Like all Russia companies, Chernogolovka faced supply headaches after West governments and companies targeted Russia with sanctions and restrictions, Sakhnina said, adding that aluminum lids and adhesive labels were a particular issue.However, the Moscow region's government pushed for Chernogolovka's inclusion in a list of firms producing crucial goods, allowing it to tap preferential lending in April and May.Interest rates leaped to 20 percent in late February, and although they have since steadily decreased to 8 percent, Chernogolovka said it was at one point able to borrow money now being used to fund expansion at a discount of 10 percentage points.While Sakhnina did not rule out the possibility of a stock market listing, she said growth was the priority. And while acquisitions are possible, including from departing West firms, there have been no talks to date, she said.""This is just the beginning,"" Sakhnina said. ""This market, if the competitive situation remains the same, will look completely different in a year.""""They are trying to climb in there, behind the tweets,"" said Kittila.

82,GT Voice: US economy to pay for graduation trip by ‘god of stocks of Capitol Hill’,Global Times,2022-08-04,"Shortly before she started what seems to be a ""graduation trip"" to Asia before stepping down as widely expected, US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi was embroiled in a scandal over her husband's purchase of chip stocks ahead of the passage of a chip subsidy bill at the US Congress, with some accusing her family of cashing in on her job and others mockingly calling her the ""god of stocks of Capitol Hill."" With her provocative visit to the island of Taiwan, Pelosi appeared to be cashing in on her leadership job again and the US economy will pay for it in the long run - not just in terms of taxpayers' money for her military transportation and extra security expanses, but actually in terms of disruptions to the massive shared economic interests between China and the US. The trip - merely to satisfy Pelosi's own vanity - has undoubtedly delivered another serious blow to already declining mutual trust between China and the US, which in turn will have serious wide-ranging implications for bilateral ties, including in economic fields. In fact, signs of the trip's impact on bilateral economic cooperation have already emerged. China's leading electric-vehicle battery maker Contemporary Amperex Technology Co (CATL) decided to put on hold plans to announce a multibillion-dollar plant in North US due to concerns over the escalated tensions between the world's two largest economies after Pelosi's visit to the island of Taiwan provoked China's core interests, several US media outlets reported on Wednesday.While CATL's potential investment plan is small compared with the overall China-US economic and trade relationship, the case could be a microcosm of growing concerns among the China and US business communities over the prospects of China-US economic and trade relationship after Pelosi's provocative visit, which could further complicate bilateral economic and trade exchanges. It is conceivable that the China and US business communities will be even more cautious about investment in the current political climate. Bilateral ties have already plunged to historical lows thanks to US's relentless, reckless crackdowns against China, which have already been weighing on bilateral economic exchanges. And markets fear, understandably so, that Pelosi's visit will further disrupt bilateral exchanges and cooperation. From China's perspective, the US is no longer to be trusted on major commitments, not as much as it used to anyway. Indeed, it would be surprising if China has not prepared for the worst, including in economic and financial areas. With the start of major military drills around the Taiwan island, the mainland has actually started or accelerated the process of reunification, which the US cannot stop. That means China is, in effect, prepared for US intervention. One can only imagine what China will do to eliminate potential risks, including its massive holdings of US treasuries. China is the second-largest foreign holder of US treasuries, only after Japan. China's holdings of US treasury securities dropped to $980.8 billion in May, falling below $1 trillion for the first time in 12 years, according to data released by the US Department of the Treasury. The further deterioration of China-US relations will likely have a direct impact on China's risk appetite for holding US treasuries, and reducing holding of US treasuries could become a precautionary option.That could deal another blow to the global standing of the US dollar - the real backbone of the US economy - which is already losing popularity as US constantly weaponizes the currency to crack down on other countries.The Russia-Ukraine conflict has already dealt a severe blow to the credibility of the dollar. Now an escalation in China-US tensions could further weaken the dollar's status if China cuts its holding of US treasuries. In this sense, in the long run, Pelosi's graduation trip will eventually come back to bite the US economy in a way that will exhaust the dollar's credibility.",SOURCE,GT VOICE,Pelosi's dangerous gamble Cartoon: Carlos Latuff,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'Asia': ('LOC', 1), 'Capitol Hill': ('LOC', 1), 'Taiwan': ('LOC', 2), 'China': ('LOC', 11), 'North US': ('LOC', 11), 'US House': ('ORG', 1), 'US Congress': ('ORG', 1), 'Contemporary Amperex Technology Co': ('ORG', 1), 'CATL': ('ORG', 2), 'Nancy Pelosi': ('PER', 5)}"
83,"Cold War mentality, Taiwan lobby distort US’ regional policy",Clifford A Kiracofe,2022-08-04,"I remember how happy US were with Nixon opening up China-US relations in 1972. I was in university then studying international relations. My parents were very happy about the establishment of relations and my brother began studying China for two years. Now we have a 180-degree opposite foreign policy to Nixon's legacy. A tragedy.The reckless visit to Taiwan island by Nancy Pelosi, Speaker of the US House of Representatives, severely damages US-China relations. Relations were already at rock bottom, but the Pelosi visit plunges them to new depths. The near-term impact of the visit is severe and the long-term impact may be considerable.  The Pelosi Taiwan island escapade presents yet another example of the duplicity of the US and its diplomacy, critics say. Additionally, it is also a demonstration of the incompetence of the Joe Biden administration and the hostility toward China in the US Congress.How can US-China relations be stabilized in light of the Pelosi visit and the seeming implacable hostility of US? Relations may not be stabilized any time soon and apparently, they will continue to deteriorate with regional, as well as with global implications.Pelosi is second in succession to the president. She is also third, after the president and vice president, in the official diplomatic protocol of the US, except in a case where a state governor is present for a diplomatic function in his own state.According to the US Constitution, the president is in charge of foreign policy and he is also the commander in chief of the military. Joe Biden did not prevent the Pelosi visit nor did he deny her the US of an official aircraft. The use of an official aircraft signifies that the visit was not a private one.The role of the House of Representatives in foreign policy is limited to oversight and to its appropriations authority such as for the State Department budget. The role of the Senate is limited to oversight, to giving advice and consent, and to confirming ambassador and high official appointments.Again, the US president is in charge of foreign policy. Pelosi as a Democrat is a member of the president's own political party. There are no excuses for the White House for the damage of the visit.US's Cold War mindset is the proximate cause of this crisis in US-China relations. The fundamental geopolitics of the US has not changed since World War II and the strategic concept of ""containment"" of the Eurasian landmass.The decades-old containment policy depends on the NATO alliance in EU to contain Russia and on the US hub and spokes alliance system in the Pacific. In recent years, the globalization of NATO has commenced and the concept of the so-called ""Indo-Pacific"" was created, with the former US Pacific Command being renamed during the Donald Trump administration as the ""Indo-Pacific"" Command.Economic warfare and information warfare are part and parcel of US's containment policy. Both are directed against not only China, but also against Russia.While Ukraine is used as a dagger pointed against Russia, Taiwan island is used as an ""unsinkable aircraft carrier"" and ""leverage"" against China mainland.The present-day Taiwan lobby is an outgrowth of the advocacy groups calling for US support for the Kuomintang regime during the period from the 1930s to 1979. These lobbying groups dominated Congress and naturally spread a lot of money around in its lobbying efforts. Nothing has changed except that the old lobby was pro-KMT, whilst in recent years it has shifted to support Taiwan separatists and the DPP.  As for the US public, it is doubtful many could locate Taiwan island on a map.If US could do so, the thought might occur that Taiwan island is to China as Hawaii is to the US. That is to say, an integral part of China although being offshore. Does China support separatist forces in Hawaii or send Hawaii or a massive amount of military equipment?  Does the Pelosi visit close the Nixon opening to China a half century ago? Not entirely, but US-China relations are severely hurt by her reckless adventure. So far, China's ambassador to US has not been recalled for consultation and the US ambassador remains in Beijing. But repairing the damage from the Pelosi visit will take considerable effort and time.US must drop its Cold War mentality, its trade war, its tech war, and its unnecessary provocations. To continue on its present foreign policy track, the US will hit a dead end.The author is an educator and former senior professional staff member of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations. opinion@globaltimes.com",OPINION,VIEWPOINT,Illustration: Chen Xia/GT,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'US': ('LOC', 13), 'China': ('LOC', 6), 'Taiwan': ('LOC', 2), 'Nixon': ('PER', 2), 'Nancy Pelosi': ('PER', 6), 'Joe Biden': ('PER', 2), 'Psi': ('PER', 1), 'US House of Representatives': ('ORG', 2), 'Congress': ('ORG', 1), 'House of Representatives': ('ORG', 2), 'Department': ('ORG', 1), 'Senate': ('ORG', 1), 'US Constitution': ('MISC', 1), 'Democrat': ('MISC', 1)}"
84,Istanbul’s ‘public bread’ factories boost production to meet rising demand,Xinhua,2022-08-04,"At a big bread factory in Istanbul, the production line runs at full steam as the machines knead the dough in huge pots, shaping it on a conveyer belt, and baked pieces of bread in the ovens.""There is a huge increase in demand for public bread right now due to the soaring bread prices in the city,"" Harun Celebi, a shift supervisor at the Istanbul Halk Ekmek (IHE) Cebeci plant in the Sultangazi district, told Xinhua while checking the baking degree of pieces of bread in a giant oven.IHE, or Istanbul Public Bread, a subsidiary of the Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality, has been producing regular bread and baked products at affordable prices for the public since its founding in 1978.The institution has recently taken a series of measures to meet the increasing demand of Istanbulites for affordable bread, increasing the efficiency of the lines of its three factories, and inaugurated a new plant to better cope with the growing demand.IHE has managed to increase its daily production capacity from 1.5 to 1.8 million units of regular bread. With more than 3,000 sales points, the institution currently meets 12 percent of Istanbul's bread needs.At the beginning of July, the price of a 210-gram loaf of regular bread produced by private bakeries in Istanbul rose from 3 to 4 liras ($0.22), marking the third hike since November 2021. IHE currently sells 250 grams of bread for 2 liras. The price of a regular loaf of IHE bread was 1.25 liras in February.Okan Gedik, head of IHE, told Xinhua in a recent written interview that due to the recent hikes in bread prices in the city of over 16 million people, the demand for public bread has increased significantly.""As a result of rising energy expenses, commodity prices, labor cost, and exchange rate effects, we are faced with a serious cost increase in every field in our country,"" he said.""The geopolitical risks in the region, which is very important for global grain production, has made the situation even riskier,"" said Gedik, referring to the grain export from Ukraine amid the ongoing crisis.""In particular, agricultural input costs showed an increasing course above all times,"" he pointed out.To prevent these price hikes, IHE has been trying to make long-term, cost-fixing contracts with its suppliers as much as possible, according to Gedik.""Additionally, we launched a direct purchasing program from our farmers to encourage wheat farming in the province of Istanbul,"" he remarked.His institution is also focusing on internal processes and efficiency studies to create savings opportunities.Turkey faced a 78.62 percent annual inflation in June, which has put a massive burden on people. The Turkey currency, the lira, lost 45 percent of its value against the US dollar in 2021 and another 25 percent in 2022.Bread has become the most important food item for the low-income population in the country, as people frequently stage long queues to buy bread with affordable prices in front of IHE kiosks. Xinhua",LIFE,CULTURE,"A bag of Simit, Turkish bagels Photo: VCG",Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'Istanbul': ('LOC', 5), 'Sultangazi': ('LOC', 1), 'Ukraine': ('LOC', 1), 'Harun Celebi': ('PER', 1), 'Okan Gedik': ('PER', 1), 'Istanbul Halk Ekmek': ('ORG', 1), 'IHE': ('ORG', 6), 'Cebeci': ('ORG', 1), 'Xinhua': ('ORG', 2), 'Istanbul Public Bread': ('ORG', 1), 'Metropolitan Municipality': ('ORG', 1)}"
85,‘Good to be back’: hugs and tears as Tonga reopens borders after it lifts restrictions,AFP,2022-08-04,"Families embraced and cried with tears of joy Monday as they reunited at Tonga's airport - the inaugural arrivals to the Pacific nation after it lifted COVID-19 restrictions for the first time since the pandemic struck.After Tonga shut its borders in March 2020, the government had tightly controlled a select list of people who were approved to fly into the kingdom - leaving over 3,000 Tongans stuck overseas.But with restrictions lifted, Monday's first batch of tourists and returning Tongans - greeted with colorful garlands and serenaded by a band at the Fua'amotu International Airport - will not have to undergo quarantine. The first plane to land was an Air New Zealand flight from Auckland carrying around 200 passengers.""It's good to be back,"" said 'Etu Palu, eager to see family again with his mother Finau Palu, who said it was ""good to visit the motherland!""Another passenger, Siosaia Filikitonga, said this was his first visit to Tonga in more than two years because of the pandemic.""I am happy and emotional. Once Tonga announced the border reopening, I booked to come,"" Filikitonga told Agence France-Presse.Amid the reunions, Sione Moala Mafi, CEO of Tonga's Ministry of Tourism, said the visitors bring an important boost to the Pacific Kingdom's economy.""I'm so glad that the border's open and that facilitates the travel between Tonga and the outside world, especially, New Zealand,"" he said.""I can see there are a lot of foreign visitors are arriving on the flight as well as Tongans.""More flights, one from New Zealand and one from Australia, are expected later this week with planes from Fiji also due Tuesday and Saturday.""We are happy to welcome them,"" Moala Mafi added.No super yachtsDespite its reopening, Tonga is taking a cautious staged approach by limiting the number of incoming flights in August under a framework announced by the Prime Minister's Office on July 22.They will review the number of flights and cruise ships for September and October, and all incoming passengers must be vaccinated and have negative COVID-19 tests before departure and three to five days after arrival.Currently the government's National Emergency Management Committee has set the current level to ""orange,"" but Moala Mafi said it looks like ""we are progressing toward"" going ""green.""""Orange now and it has to be reviewed at the end of this month,"" he said.So far, yachts and super yachts are not included in the border reopening, much to the frustration of tourism operators, who say July, with its fantastic weather, is the peak season in Tonga.""I've got 20 boats sitting in Tahiti that want to come to Tonga. Big boats, I'm not talking about little yachts, because they won't let the yachts come back in here and I don't know why,"" said David Hunt, owner of Super Yacht Services Tonga.He was waiting at the airport to meet a yacht owner who had not seen his yacht moored in Vava'u - one of Tonga's islands - for over three years.""Before the pandemic, we were averaging about 30 to 35 yachts a year between operators, but it could be much more this year,"" he said. ""They've got all these boats coming down to the Pacific they don't want to be in Ukraine, in the Mediterranean.""Moala Mafi said the government is still undecided on yachts in Tongan waters.Agence France-Presse",TRAVEL,FEATURE,"An international visitor is welcomed with a kahoa (garland) by Tonga Ministry of Tourism staff upon arriving at Fua'amotu International Airport in Tonga on August 1, 2022.

Pelosi arrived in the island on Tuesday night and left on Wednesday afternoon, and the visit is seen as a serious violation of the one-China principle.Ambassador Chedondo said any official visit to the island of Taiwan, whether by commission or omission, violates the 1971 UN General Assembly Resolution 2758 and could set the world on a perilous path.""In our view, such high-level visits by any nation not only take US back to the pre-1971 era but clearly undermine the credibility of the UN as the sole multilateral institution that guarantees global peace and stability,"" he said.On October 25, 1971, at its 26th session, the UN adopted Resolution 2758 with an overwhelming majority. It decided to restore all lawful rights of the China in the UN and recognize the representatives of its government as the only legitimate UN representatives of China.""We firmly believe that we have come so far in building these institutions and it is our collective responsibility to promote and defend achievements made thus far. In that regard, diplomatic consultations between nations are a prerequisite for world peace,"" he said.""Unilateralism and hegemony have no place in a world in which a majority of nations have embraced multilateralism,"" the ambassador stressed. He also noted that major powers must be responsible and exercise restraint in solving disagreements. ""We believe that the international situation is under intense pressure from the challenges of COVID-19, conflict, and economic challenges emanating from the war in Ukraine.

87,"US-led G7 repeats playbook of stirring tension, framing China over Straits tension; Pelosi's mess prompts US media to explain why one-China policy matters",Chen Qingqing,2022-08-04,"With the highly provocative visit of a high-ranking US official to Taiwan being under the spotlight for the past week, the US-led West's wrestling with China has been shifting to pressuring China on the global stage by accusing it of causing the rising cross-Straits tensions, like the US always does in confusing right and wrong. As a puppet of the US, the G7 censured Beijing's legitimate defense and response to US's serious provocation, reflecting its hypocrisy, duplicity and ugliness.As the one-China principle is universally recognized by the international community and the UN resolution affirms the one-China principle, the US-led small clique can't openly challenge this principle otherwise it's challenging the rule-based world order. But certain countries and politicians, who have been manipulated by US to serve the latter's geopolitical goals by playing the Taiwan card, attempted to separate the island from China with the so-called democratic values, intending to follow the suit of the US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. From how China reacted now and will react to Pelosi's reckless move with comprehensive countermeasures, those countries and politicians should carefully consider the consequences of challenging China's red line, otherwise, they will pay unbearable prices, experts and officials warned. Both the China Foreign Ministry and the China Mission to the EU slammed the G7 statement on Thursday, calling it evil and shameless, which is reminiscent of the ""Eight-Power Allied Forces"" that invaded China a hundred years ago. The China State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi also firmly refuted the statement, saying that it confused the right with the wrong and its wrong deeds aroused the strong indignation from the China people. ""The US instigated the trouble and the crisis, escalating the situation. If we don't react to such malicious and blatant provocation with countermeasures, how can we stick to the principle of non-interference in internal affairs? How can we uphold the international law and safeguard regional peace?"" Wang said during the foreign ministers' meetings on East Asia cooperation in Cambodia.The fundamental reason for the current tension in the Taiwan Straits is that the US ignored China's strong opposition and solemn representation, connived with the US No.3 political figure to visit the island by taking a US military aircraft, which is a major incident of elevating the US-Taiwan relations, seriously damaging one-China principle and China's sovereignty and territorial integrity, Hua Chunying, spokesperson of the China Foreign Ministry, said at a press conference on Thursday. The US made the malicious provocation first, and China followed with a justifiable defense, Hua said, noting that the G7 nations earlier kept silent and ignored the visit but now have jumped out to accuse China's legitimate reaction, which only exposes their hypocrisy and ugly faces, the spokesperson said.

To avoid this crisis imposed on China, China has already made the greatest diplomatic efforts, but at the same time, China will never tolerate any attempt to create tension, instigate confrontation and incite secession in the region, Wang noted. At 12 pm on Thursday, the People's Liberation Army Eastern Theater Command Army started to conduct major military exercises and training activities including live-fire drills in six large maritime areas and their air space surrounding the island, which will last until Sunday noon. Also, starting Wednesday, China mainland customs authorities suspended imports of citrus fruits and some frozen fish imports from the island. It also suspended exports of natural sand, of which Taiwan reportedly sources over 90 percent from the mainland.In the meantime, mainland authorities announced Wednesday that a number of diehard ""Taiwan secessionist"" individuals, two funds, and multiple companies related to secessionist activities will be punished in accordance with the law.The comprehensive measures taken by China now and in the future are necessary and timely defensive countermeasures, which are made after careful consideration and evaluation, Wang said, noting that the purpose of those measures is to safeguard the national sovereignty and security, which comply with international and domestic law. They serve as a warning to those who provoke, and help safeguard the regional stability and peace across the Straits, he said. The way they're accusing China who is a defender of escalating tensions reminded some experts of the playbook how the US-led West provoked Russia and pushed it into a corner and then accused it for launching military operations in Ukraine. Although the Taiwan question is essentially different from the Ukraine crisis, the West tactics of instigating conflicts are the same, some experts said. The US, as always, is using G7 as a tool to advance its own interests and agenda. The US is gradually undermining the status quo in the Taiwan Straits by hollowing out its commitment to the one-China policy but then subsequently framing China as the aggressor for responding, Tom Fowdy, a South Korea-based political analyst, told the Global Times on Thursday. ""It is a classic part of the US playbook to do this, and it almost certainly attempts to encourage other countries to also challenge China's red line on Taiwan,"" he said. While the Taiwan question is different from the Ukraine crisis, the way that the US seeks to push against other countries' red lines, refuses to compromise and then frames them as aggressors are similar, and also like on the Ukraine issue, the US seeks to build a coalition of countries to oppose China, Fowdy said. Global consensus Despite US's ill-intentioned attempts to form small cliques to manipulate the understanding of the Taiwan question, the international community clearly shares the consensus on the matter as when it comes to the Taiwan question, there are undeniable historical facts, solid international law and wide international consensus that confirm the basic truth: There is only one China in the world and Taiwan is an inalienable part of China, which is also explicitly stated in the UN resolution. In responding to Pelosi's visit, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said in the latest press briefing that ""our position is very clear, we abide by General Assembly resolutions, by the one-China policy, and that is the orientation that we have in everything we do.""More countries including Cuba, Mexico, Iran, Brazil and South Korea reiterated their adherence to the one-China principle and the UN Resolution 2758 on Thursday, condemning Pelosi's provocative visit. Multilateral groups such as ASEAN and Arab League also voiced support for the one-China policy on Thursday. That the mainland and Taiwan belong to the same country is a fact that hundreds of countries recognized when they established diplomatic relations with China. Only when the international relations are built under historical and legal contexts, will there be a fair world order, Yang Xiyu, a senior research fellow at the China Institute of International Studies, told the Global Times on Thursday. ""If we let the West define this order and the reunification can't be realized, it will serve as a turning point for the global community, which means all the international relations would be defined by geopolitical interests rather than justice,"" Yang said. The international community clearly understands why the Taiwan question is sensitive to China and where China's red line is, as some voiced opposition and concerns over Pelosi's visit and the damage it caused.""We're on a trajectory of escalating conflict and this will certainly make matters worse. It plays well to local politics in the US and in Taiwan, but it does not play well to geostrategic forces that are pushing these two nations apart, Stephen Roach, a Yale University senior fellow and former Federal Reserve economist, was quoted as saying in a report of CNBC on Wednesday. The leadership in both the US and China to address this conflict is compromised by this basically pouring salt in an open wound for China, he said. In recent days, a number of US media outlets such as CNBC and the New York Post tried to explain what the ""one-China policy"" is and why it's important to China. In the eyes of the China public and some experts, Pelosi's visit did only one favorable thing: help more US people understand what China's core interest is. And when the core interest is threatened, the China government will not hesitate to roll out massive and strong measures and let the provocateurs feel the pain. These countermeasures also serve as a warning to other West politicians who intend to follow US' path, experts said. Recently, the Germany Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock claimed that Germany will support the island of Taiwan if the mainland conducts military actions; some UK lawmakers said they're also planning to visit the island later this year. Anti-China politicians in countries like Lithuania also played the Taiwan card but then faced unaffordable fallout for trampling on one-China principle. Those anti-China politicians should understand that no matter how high they jump on the Taiwan question and how much they advocate, those moves won't affect our strong determination and will in handling the Taiwan question, Wu Weishan Xinbo, dean of the Institute of International Studies at Fudan University, told the Global Times. ""When it comes to the Taiwan question, those countries need to be cautious, otherwise, the consequences could be beyond their imagination and become unbearable,"" he said.",CHINA,DIPLOMACY,G7 FM meeting. Photo: VCG,"Reporter, Beijing","Chen Qingqing co-leads the Global Times China desk.

88,China-Japan FM talks cancelled after G7 unjustly criticizes China over Taiwan question,Xu Keyue,2022-08-04,"Talks between the China and Japan foreign ministers, which were reportedly scheduled for Thursday afternoon on the sidelines of ASEAN events in Phnom Penh, have been cancelled, after Japan with other Group of Seven (G7) members and the EU (EU) issued a statement that unjustly accused China over the Taiwan question, a spokesperson of the China Foreign Ministry confirmed on Thursday afternoon.China observers urged Japan not to blindly follow and support the US, and warned of another potential blow in bilateral ties. They believed Japan's decision to serve as a US vassal on this issue exposed the country's goal of using the Taiwan question to expand its own military capacity.  ""China will no longer arrange talks between China and Japan foreign ministers in Phnom Penh,"" said Hua Chunying, spokesperson of the ministry at a regular press briefing on Thursday, condemning the joint statement issued by the G7 foreign ministers and the high representative of the EU as ""fueling the US' violation of China's sovereignty.""  ""Japan bears historical responsibility for the Taiwan question and is in no position to make irresponsible remarks on it,"" Hua pointed out.Historically Taiwan had been under Japan colonial rule for 50 years, which brought great misery to Taiwan residents. US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's visit to the island of Taiwan, which seriously violated the one-China principle and  China's sovereignty, has sparked joint military exercises around Taiwan by the China People's Liberation Army (PLA) .The G7 statement said they are concerned by the ""threatening actions by China"" across the Taiwan Straits, which ""risk unnecessary escalation."" The statement called on China not to unilaterally change the status quo by force in the region, and to resolve differences by peaceful means.At a Thursday press conference, China Ambassador to Japan Kong Xuanyou urged Japan to recognize the grave harm of Pelosi's Taiwan visit, honor its commitment in the four China-Japan political documents, refrain from blindly following the US and making wrong remarks on the Taiwan question, and stop sending wrong signals to the Taiwan secessionist forces.Japan's involvement in the irresponsible G7 statement has ruined the talks between China and Japan foreign ministers, and Japan should bear the responsibility for and shoulder the consequences of the cancellation, observers stressed, noting that the cancellation also reflected China's anger toward Japan, as well as the further deterioration of bilateral ties. Da Zhigang, director of the Institute of Northeast Asia Studies at the Heilongjiang Provincial Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times that Japan politicians have always flirted with the Taiwan question, and have tried to use the issue as well as the Ukraine crisis as excuses to increase its military spending. The country is also pushing hard to link the Taiwan question to its alliance with the US as a bargaining chip to stoke geopolitical tensions, the expert warned.After Pelosi visited the island of Taiwan despite China's strong opposition, the international community, including the UN and many countries, reaffirmed their adherence to the one-China principle, voicing discontent and condemnation of Pelosi's provocative visit.However, unlike South Korea President Yoon Suk-yeol, who appeared to have snubbed Pelosi during her visit to Seoul on Thursday, Japan Prime Minister Fumio Kishida reportedly plans to hold talks with Pelosi in Tokyo on Friday and is likely to reaffirm the importance of peace and stability in the Taiwan Straits, according to Japan media.There is a sharp contrast between the leaders of Japan and South Korea regarding Pelosi's visit to Taiwan region. Regardless of China's condemnation, sanctions and even military exercises as countermeasures to Pelosi's Taiwan visit, Kishida still plans to meet Pelosi, which would damage China-Japan relations, Da warned.A parliamentary delegation led by former Japan defense ministers arrived in China's Taiwan island on July 27 to discuss ""security concerns"" across the Taiwan Straits. The move is seen by experts as a pretext to hype conflict, with the true intention of expanding Japan's military power.Former Japan defense ministers Shigeru Ishiba and Yasukazu Hamada led a parliamentary delegation of four from Japan's National Diet to China's Taiwan, and arrived at Songshan Airport in Taipei on Wednesday morning. During the trip, they are scheduled to hold talks with Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) authorities, local media reported.The purpose of the visit is to ""discuss extensively the regional security situation in Taiwan, especially in the context of the Russia-Ukraine military conflict,"" local media reported.",CHINA,DIPLOMACY,"Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi at the ASEAN Foreign Ministers' Meeting in Cambodia on August 3, 2022.

89,Wang Yi has no plan to meet Blinken during ASEAN meetings amid tensions caused by Pelosi’s trip to Taiwan island,Zhao Yusha,2022-08-02,"China State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi has no plans to meet with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken although both are attending the 55th ASEAN Foreign Ministers' Meeting and related meetings in Phnom Penh this week, China Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying announced on Tuesday, as tensions rise over Speaker of the US House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi's visit to Taiwan island. The decision is seen by observers as a signal that reflects the severity of the visit, as well as China's outrage toward US provocations.Wang is scheduled to attend meetings with foreign ministers from ASEAN and East Asia countries from Wednesday to Friday, which will focus on regional security and development, as well as how to cope with rising uncertainties that come with COVID-19, the Russia-Ukraine crisis, and the US pushing its Indo-Pacific strategy that threatens regional stability.Wang will attend the ASEAN-China Foreign Ministers' Meeting, ASEAN Plus Three Foreign Ministers' Meeting, East Asia Summit Foreign Ministers' Meeting, and a foreign ministers' meeting of the ASEAN Regional Forum from Wednesday to Friday in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, Hua announced.Wang will also pay a visit to Cambodia at the invitation of Cambodian Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Prak Sokhonn, Hua added. She revealed that Wang is going to meet and exchange opinions with foreign ministers from countries including Laos, Brunei, Japan, Sri Lanka and New Zealand on issues of common concern, and that Wang has no plan to meet Antony Blinken, who is also scheduled to participate in the US-ASEAN Ministerial Meeting, the East Asia Summit Foreign Ministers' Meeting, and the ASEAN Regional Forum from Wednesday to Friday.China experts see the lack of a meeting between Wang and Antony Blinken as demonstrating the severity of Pelosi's visit, and China's anger over US' provocation. ""There's no need for Wang to meet and talk with Antony Blinken anymore. We've said what we need to say, did what we should do… the US has received all information it needs, but Antony Blinken insisted on making wrong comments,"" Zhang Tengjun, deputy director of the Department for Asia-Pacific Studies at the China Institute of International Studies, told the Global Times. Giving remarks to reporters during a press conference at the UN headquarters in New York on Monday, Antony Blinken said that ""If the speaker does decide to visit [Taiwan] and China tries to create some kind of crisis or otherwise escalate tensions,  that would be entirely on Beijing,"" Antony Blinken said. ""We are looking for them, in the event she decides to visit, to act responsibly and not to engage in any escalation going forward.""In response, Hua said at Tuesday's conference that the world sees clearly that it is the US who started the provocation first and caused tension, thus the US should take full responsibility for the situation.She also called out Antony Blinken's remarks for showing US hegemony and gangster logic, which is ""I can challenge you at my will, but you cannot oppose nor defend yourself.""Zhang noted that what the US Secretary of State said showed he has no sincerity, no desire to listen to China, and that it has totally ruined the atmosphere for a possible meeting between Antony Blinken and Wang. This week's events are the first in-person meetings between foreign ministers from ASEAN countries after a two-year hiatus due to COVID-19 pandemic, the Straits Times reported. It said that ASEAN foreign ministers will also meet their counterparts from 11 key dialogue partners this week - Australia, Canada, China, the EU, India, Japan, New Zealand, South Korea, Russia, the UK and the US.Experts said the succession of meetings come amid a peculiar backdrop when regional countries are facing bumps in the road due to COVID-19 and the Ukraine crisis, in addition to the pressure they face as the US pushes its Indo-Pacific strategy. When asked about China's expectations for the series of meetings, Hua said that China's cooperation with ASEAN and East Asia countries are continuing their great momentum. China always sees ASEAN as an important force in maintaining regional stability and promoting integration of the regional economy. China hopes the series of meetings can solidify the consensus of all parties, strengthen cooperation among all countries and inject a new impetus to region's peace and stability, Hua said. Xu Liping, a research fellow on Southeast Asia studies at the China Academy of Social Sciences in Beijing, said that ASEAN should play the role of mediator during the turbulent situation, as it will not be easily swayed by certain countries and always sticks to strategic autonomy. This stance, Xu said, can help the region and the world to use cooperation instead of confrontation. Experts believe Pelosi's visit is overshadowing the meetings, as well as ASEAN and East Asia countries' long-cherished peace and stability. Pelosi, who began her Asia trip on Monday in Singapore and Malaysia, will also travel to South Korea and Japan.Xu called this trip a ""trip of trouble, and inappropriate political farce,"" as hyping the Taiwan question when Ukraine crisis is yet to be solved is detrimental for regional stability.ASEAN and East Asia countries value peace and stability more than anything else, because this is what guarantees the region's rapid development, according to Xu, noting that those countries see Pelosi's visit as throwing the region into big uncertainty. When meeting with Pelosi on Monday, Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong highlighted the importance of stable US-China relations for regional peace and security to the US delegation, Reuters quoted Singapore's foreign ministry as saying.",CHINA,DIPLOMACY,"Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister, Wang Yi Photo: fmprc.gov.cn","Reporter, Beijing","Global Times reporter covering international affairs, politics and society.","{'China': ('LOC', 7), 'US': ('LOC', 6), 'Phnom Penh': ('LOC', 2), 'Taiwan': ('LOC', 1), 'East Asia': ('LOC', 2), 'Russia': ('LOC', 1), 'Ukraine': ('LOC', 1), 'Pacific': ('LOC', 1), 'Cambodia': ('LOC', 2), 'Laos': ('LOC', 1), 'Brunei': ('LOC', 1), 'Japan': ('LOC', 1), 'Sri Lanka': ('LOC', 1), 'New Zealand': ('LOC', 1), 'Council': ('ORG', 1), 'Foreign': ('ORG', 1), 'Foreign Ministry': ('ORG', 2), 'US House of Representatives': ('ORG', 1), 'ASEAN Regional Forum': ('ORG', 2), 'Blink': ('ORG', 3), 'Ten': ('ORG', 1), 'Department': ('ORG', 1), 'Pacific Studies': ('ORG', 1), 'Institute': ('ORG', 1), 'International Studies': ('ORG', 1), 'Global Times': ('ORG', 1), 'UN': ('ORG', 1), 'New': ('ORG', 1), 'Wang Yi': ('PER', 8), 'Antony Blinken': ('PER', 6), 'Hua Chunying': ('PER', 3), 'Nancy Pelosi': ('PER', 2), 'Prak Sokhonn': ('PER', 1), 'Zhang': ('PER', 1), 'York': ('PER', 1), 'ASEAN': ('MISC', 4), ""' Meeting"": ('MISC', 6), 'COVID - 19': ('MISC', 1), 'Indo -': ('MISC', 1), 'ASEAN Plus Three': ('MISC', 5), 'East Asia Summit': ('MISC', 2), 'Cambodian': ('MISC', 1)}"
90,China refutes German FM's wrong remarks over Taiwan question,Global Times,2022-08-03,"China urges Germany to have an objective and accurate understanding of the Taiwan question, abide by the one-China principle with concrete actions, China Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Hua Chunying said at Wednesday's press briefing in response to Germany Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock's remarks claiming that Germany will support the island of Taiwan if the China mainland conducts military actions.Hua said that Baerbock's remarks on the Taiwan Straits situation and the claims of ""in violation of international law"" made during the review conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons lack ""common sense,"" and are also ""inconsistent with the facts."" In fact, for some time now, some Germany politicians have made irresponsible remarks on China-related issues, and China has also promptly refuted them and has made it clear that we oppose them, Hua said.The historical and legal facts which prove that the island of Taiwan is part of China and that both sides of the Taiwan Straits belong to one and the same China shall never be altered by anyone or any force, Hua noted.Some people are deliberately distorting the concept and confusing the public by comparing the Ukraine crisis with the Taiwan question. This is a serious interference in China's internal affairs, Hua said. ""Violation of the one-China principle would undermine the overall development of bilateral relations.''In December 1943, the Cairo Declaration was issued by the China, US and UK governments, stipulating that Japan should return to China all the territories it had stolen, including Northeast China, Taiwan and the Penghu Archipelago. The Potsdam Proclamation signed by China, the US and UK in July 1945 (subsequently joined by the Soviet Union) stipulated that ""The terms of the Cairo Declaration shall be carried out."" There is one China in the world, Taiwan is an inalienable part of China's territory, and the Government of the China is the sole legal government representing the whole of China. This has been clearly recognized by UN General Assembly Resolution 2758 of 1971. Many countries including Russia, Cuba and Pakistan have reaffirmed their positions of upholding the one-China principle following the Speaker of the US House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi's visit to Taiwan.

91,"Pelosi changes status quo of Taiwan Straits with provocative visit, exposes US long-term miscalculation",Chen Qingqing,2022-08-03,"When US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi landed in Taiwan island and touted the US' so-called commitment to the island, her extremely reckless and dangerous move immediately prompted a series of countermeasures from China, ranging from the military to diplomacy to economic sanctions. China's reaction to this serious intrusion on the country's sovereignty is widely considered as rational and reasonable, underscoring its firm strategic determination and sufficient patience to adhere to its own timetable in solving the Taiwan question. And such steady advancement of its own agenda gives Beijing the edge compared with the short-sighted US that will lose more points in the long-term geopolitical wrestling match. Within less than 10 hours after five China authorities including the China Foreign Ministry, Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, Taiwan Affairs Office of the CPC Central Committee, Foreign Affairs Committee of the China People's Political Consultative Conference National Committee and the Ministry of National Defense, used strong and robust language to condemn Pelosi's visit, the China Foreign Ministry summoned US Ambassador to China Nicholas Burns to protest against Pelosi's visit and China State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi issued a second strong statement condemning the US' intrusion on China's sovereignty. China embassies in countries like the UK, Japan and India all released similarly stern messages, and Qin Gang, China envoy to the US, lodged solemn representations and strong protests in the first place with the US White House National UN and the Department of State. Besides unprecedented diplomatic warnings, joint military exercises around the island by the China People's Liberation Army (PLA) continued Wednesday with joint blockades, sea assaults, land attacks and air combat trainings with the participation of advanced weapons including J-20 stealth fighter jets and DF-17 hypersonic missiles after the drills started on Tuesday evening. The exercises are unprecedented in that conventional missiles are expected to fly over the island of Taiwan for the first time, the PLA forces will enter the sea area within 12 nautical miles to the island, and that the so-called median line will no longer exist, experts said.In addition, mainland customs announced on Wednesday morning the suspension of imports of citrus fruits and some frozen fish imports from the island. It also suspended exports of natural sand, of which Taiwan reportedly sources over 90 percent from the mainland. During a press briefing of the China Foreign Ministry on Wednesday, many reporters were concerned with what countermeasures the China government would roll out and whether Beijing will sanction the island or Pelosi, and some followed up with questions such as how China will punish those who offended the country. ""From those questions, I believe that we all consider Pelosi's move as extremely wrong, so it has to be punished,"" Hua Chunying, spokesperson of the ministry, told the briefing. ""They will reap what they sowed. Relevant countermeasures will be forceful and effective, the US and secessionists in Taiwan will feel the impact,"" she said.

(eng.chinamil.com.cn/Photo by Gu Xixi, Xu Jiawang and Guo Shuai)Rational strategic choice Until Pelosi arrived at Taipei's Songshan airport on Tuesday evening, the China side had not adopted one of the possible ways speculated by public opinion in response to the provocation: the PLA could send warplanes and warships to escort her plane. However, some experts said that when it comes to military countermeasures, one factor to be considered is to avoid military conflicts or gunfire in adopting the countermeasure. When it comes to sending warplanes to intercept Pelosi's plane, such close-range countermeasures can easily lead to a gunfire incident. ""There's no need to launch a war with the US now, as it's not in line with our national strategy,"" Jin Canrong, associate dean of the School of International Studies at the Renmin University of China, told the Global Times on Wednesday. Jin believes that in face of Pelosi's visit, China society showed an unprecedented consistent public opinion of ""safeguarding the national reunification"" and ""opposing US provocation,"" which lays out a strong public opinion foundation for launching the process of reunification, therefore solving the Taiwan question will only be a matter of time in the next few years. In response to the reported disappointment of the China public for not stopping Pelosi's visit asked by Reuters, Hua from the China Foreign Ministry said it is believed that China people are patriotic in a rational way. ""We are in full confidence of firmly safeguarding the country's sovereignty and territorial integrity,"" she said.While some foreign observers also questioned whether Pelosi's visit crossed China's red line, China experts affirmed that China's red line is not whether Pelosi visited the island or not but it's the one-China principle. ""Although Pelosi's visit to the island itself is a provocation to the principle, China is now taking subsequent countermeasures to reinforce and defend it in order to make this red line clearer to the US and US politicians. As result, they will bear the serious consequences and others won't dare to challenge it in a similar way,"" Xin Qiang, deputy director of the Center for US Studies at Fudan University, told the Global Times on Wednesday. In the eyes of China experts, the visit signals a further decline in the already weak political trust between China and the US, which also changed US's so-called status quo over the Taiwan Straits. ""In fact, the cross-Straits situation is entering a new phase now. The US made one extremely dangerous step forward, which means China will take two steps forward,"" Lü Xiang, a research fellow at the China Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times on Wednesday. The ongoing military drills around the island are a ""rehearsal to solve the Taiwan question by force,"" he said, noting that from now on, the PLA will take tighter control over the airspace and surrounding sea areas of Taiwan to elevate China's security bottom-line, Lü said. Pelosi's Taiwan visit is opening salvo in a war with China that the US will lose, Franz Gayl, a retired Marine Corps infantry officer and a former Pentagon employee, told the Global Times.""Do members of the US public understand the horrors their government is about to inflict on their sons and daughters when they are sent off to fight a wholly inappropriate intervention that the US will lose?"" Gayl asked. The status quo has finally changed. Any illusion that the US is or ever was committed to the one-China policy has evaporated, he said.""The arrival of the Speaker of the House of Representatives and second in line to serve as the Chief Executive in the sitting president's absence has ended decades of reunification efforts. From the perspective of the China, the Three Communiqués which set the conditions for US-PRC diplomatic relations are viewed by the US to be worthless pieces of paper,"" Galy said.

Photo: VCGLong-term patience vs. shortsighted interests US officials said Joe Biden never told Pelosi not to go, The New York Times reported, but it contradicts the fact that Joe Biden believed US military officials felt it was ""not a good idea."" When Pelosi arrived in Taiwan, some US-led West media outlets considered it as a ""victory."" However, in contrast to China's long-term strategic determination and patience, the US' biggest miscalculation is to undermine the overall China-US relations for the selfish interests of certain politicians, and when the US is playing the Taiwan card to create crisis scenarios across the Straits, China is steadily turning those scenarios into opportunities to achieve its goal of reunification. Such long-term rational strategic consideration also helped it tackle previous crisis such as the disputes over the Diaoyu Islands, the China Sea and the riots in Hong Kong in 2019. ""Every time the US provokes China, the result has been shame on themselves,"" Hua said during the press briefing. The latest example was Pelosi instigating the black-clad riots in Hong Kong and touting the so-called ""beautiful sight,"" which just accelerated the later transition of the city from chaos to stability, she noted. When the trade war between China and the US started in 2018, many people saw that the US had taken the initiative to attack US and that there was still a gap between China and the US in terms of strength, Xin said, noting that those people thought that China did not have enough countermeasures and therefore ""the US was certain to win."" ""However, after some time, people realized this was not the case. The US itself has come to the conclusion that more than 90 percent of the cost of the trade war is borne by the US middle-classes,"" he said. Pelosi's visit came amid intense global media scrutiny. The 82-year-old is fighting hard to gain more support as the midterm elections loom, and apparently, the US scored the first blow amid the current wrestling match with China by defying Beijing's warning and making her visit happen. However, in a long-term perspective, the US is putting its most important foreign relationship at risk, further weakening its political credibility but accelerating China's reunification, experts said.""After this visit, China-US relations will surely go backward, and cross-Straits relations will get worse. No matter whether on domestic issues or foreign affairs, the US needs China's help on issues such as climate change, North Korean nuclear issue, the Ukraine crisis and its own inflation, but how much support can the US government gain from China after this?"" Xin said.Reunification is considered as a final step to achieve China's rejuvenation, and the China government has its own pace in solving the Taiwan question, experts said. But Pelosi's reckless move largely helped this process, making the whole world closely observe China's irrefutable sovereignty over Taiwan and how the US constantly lost points in its international morality and image by hurting China-US relations. It looks like the visit helped the US ""score a win,"" just for now, but in the long run, it will lose more advantages, especially when China completes its rejuvenation, it will be a full-scale wrestling match between China and the US and the latter will see its hegemonic position in the world diminish, experts predicted.",CHINA,DIPLOMACY,US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.

It said that the Deputy Secretary-General of ASEAN Kung Phoak, Secretary of State of Cambodia's foreign ministry, said the meeting would seek to calm the waters.He told reporters that ministers would try to find ways the bloc could help ""so that the situation in Taiwan will be stable, that it won't lead to a conflict and won't escalate the political heat among all concerned parties.""Talking to reporters at the ASEAN Foreign Ministers' Meeting in Cambodia on Wednesday, China State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi said that Pelosi's visit was a complete ""farce"" and those who play with fire won't end well, and who offend China will be punished. The US is conspiring to violate China's sovereignty under the banner of ""democracy,"" and Taiwan regional leader Tsai Ing-wen is colluding with the US, walking back on national interests, said Wang, noting that all those actions that try to turn the clock back won't change the international consensus of the one-China principle, and won't change the trend that Taiwan will eventually return to the embrace of the motherland. The Lao government firmly supports the one-China principle and China's cause of national reunification, and it opposes any attempt to create ""two Chinas"" or ""one China, one Taiwan."" Laos is concerned that relevant provocative acts may trigger regional tensions, said the Lao Foreign Ministry on Wednesday. ""Vietnam wishes for all relevant parties to restrain themselves, not escalate tensions in the Taiwan Straits, positively contribute to the maintenance of peace and stability, and strengthen cooperation and development in the region and the world,"" Vietnamese Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokeswoman Le Thi Thu Hang said on Wednesday. ""It is important for the US and China to ensure continuing communication to avoid any miscalculation and further escalation of tensions,"" Ambassador Ma. Teresita Daza, spokesperson of the Philippines' Department of Foreign Affairs, said in a WhatsApp message to the media on Tuesday, the Philippine Star reported.Pelosi's visit has pushed ASEAN countries into a precarious situation where they sense rising foreign interference and threats to regional stability. This is something that those countries are striving to avoid, and it challenges their long-cherished peace and development, Tang Qifang, an associate research fellow at the China Institute of International Studies, told the Global Times.Tang expected ASEAN countries to stress their unified stance during the ASEAN meetings and push for regional stability. Worsening China-US ties pose a grave threat to smaller countries.Chen Xiangmiao, an assistant research fellow at the National Institute for China Sea Studies, said that there is no doubt that sticking to the one-China principle and avoiding the China-US escalating conflict represent a consensus within the ASEAN bloc. ""The reason why not every country from the bloc speaks out is because some are afraid of aggravating the US. After all, the US government has been depicting Pelosi's visit as her personal choice,"" said Chen, noting that Pelosi's visit and the trouble that has come after it has made those countries clearer to the fact of who is the biggest saboteur of regional stability.After shouldering the blow of COVID-19 and the Ukraine crisis, regional countries crave stability more than anything else, and any country that tries to stir conflict in this region will be persona non grata, according to Chen. This week's events are the first in-person meetings of foreign ministers from ASEAN countries after a two-year hiatus due to COVID-19 pandemic, the Straits Times reported. It said that ASEAN foreign ministers will also meet their counterparts from 11 key dialogue partners this week - Australia, Canada, China, the EU, India, Japan, New Zealand, South Korea, Russia, the UK and the US.China Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying announced that Wang Yi has no plans to meet with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken although both are attending the 55th ASEAN Foreign Ministers' Meeting and related meetings in Cambodia, a decision seen by experts as a signal that reflects the severity of the visit, as well as China's outrage toward the US provocations.Because of ASEAN countries' reluctance to see an escalating conflict between Beijing and US, Chen said that those countries could serve as ""mediators"" to assuage the tension, as this bloc always upholds a goal of ""not taking sides"" and a neutral stance, which gives it a legitimate posture to persuade US from adding fuel to the fire.Also this bloc can provide multiple platforms for big powers to negotiate, said Chen, citing the holding of the G20 meeting in Indonesia in the latter half of this year, and the APEC meeting in Thailand.",CHINA,DIPLOMACY,"Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi at the ASEAN Foreign Ministers' Meeting in Cambodia on August 3, 2022.

93,Yuan internationalization gains pace amid geopolitical tensions as Rusal issues bonds,Chu Daye,2022-08-03,"More countries are poised to pivot to the yuan, arguably the most preferred non-West currency for the developing world, China experts said on Wednesday, amid a global push toward de-dollarization that began in 2021.The yuan's relatively stable exchange rate and market anticipation of gradual appreciation has ensured its popularity among many developing countries, especially after the Russia-Ukraine conflict began in February.The latest example of the yuan's growing foothold abroad is the issuance of 4 billion yuan ($590 million) worth of yuan-denominated bonds in the Russia market by Rusal, a Russia aluminum company, with the issuance completed on Wednesday.Analysts at underwriter Gazprombank predicted that more Russia companies will follow suit, and the yuan will be increasingly popular in Russia due to US-led West sanctions.Prior to the Rusal deal, India cement producer Ultratech reportedly purchased coal from Russia coal trader major SUEK in a deal worth 172 million yuan.China analysts said rising geopolitical tensions and the West's seizure of Russia assets have taught many countries a lesson. Due to the yuan's unique status as the most preferred non-West currency for developing nations, the use of the yuan in terms of reserves and settlements is expanding since the second half of 2021.Zhou Yu, director of the Research Center of International Finance at the Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences, said that after West countries lost investors' trust in their handling of Russia assets amid the conflict, more countries diversified away from dollar assets and the yuan became their currency of choice.Diversifying into the yuan met with their economic interests, Zhou said, pointing to the yuan's relatively resilient exchange rate with the world's major economies.In Russia, the yuan's share increased from 0.1 percent in 2017 to 17.1 percent in 2021, public data showed.Wang Peng, a research fellow at the Beijing Academy of Social Sciences, said that the Rusal case is just a new example of the vast potential of the yuan's internationalization.""Seen from a long-term perspective, there are still many scenarios for yuan settlements, and more countries are likely to adopt the currency out of concerns for convenience, security and efficiency,"" Wang said, noting that this would especially be true for countries more closely related to China's supply chains.It also meets the requirements of relevant countries' needs for diversification, risk control and stability.Russia experts said both China and Russia stand to gain if the yuan becomes the major settlement currency of the BRICS countries. The National Bank of Belarus, the central bank of Belarus, has expanded the list of foreign currencies included in the basket that is used for setting the exchange rate, adding the yuan with a weight of 10 percent starting from July 15.In March, The Wall Street Journal reported that Saudi Arabia was considering accepting yuan instead of US dollars for oil sales.Global mining giant BHP, based in Melbourne, officially started yuan-based spot iron ore trades at China ports on July 10. But Zhou said the yuan's internationalization will still be a gradual process and there is no way that the yuan's share will increase too fast. It took the dollar decades to topple the UK pound, even after the US economy outstripped that of the UK. The yuan's share of global reserves was 2.9 percent as of end March, up from 2.8 percent in the fourth quarter and 2.5 percent a year ago, IMF data showed.",SOURCE,ECONOMY,RMB Photo:VCG,"Reporter, Beijing","Chu Daye is a business reporter at the Global Times focusing on general topics, trade, investment and energy.","{'West': ('MISC', 5), 'US': ('MISC', 1), 'China': ('LOC', 3), 'Russia': ('LOC', 9), 'Ukraine': ('LOC', 1), 'India': ('LOC', 1), 'Beijing': ('LOC', 1), 'Rusal': ('ORG', 2), 'Gazprombank': ('ORG', 1), 'Ultratech': ('ORG', 1), 'SUEK': ('ORG', 1), 'Research Center of International Finance': ('ORG', 1), 'Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences': ('ORG', 1), 'Zhou Yu': ('PER', 2), 'Wang': ('PER', 2)}"
94,Dim mid-term election prospects of Democrats risk igniting more tensions,Global Times,2022-08-01,"With less than 100 days to go before the US mid-term elections, many US media outlets, polls and observers see the Democrats' prospects dim. A new Bloomberg Economics study showed that ""President Joe Biden's party can expect to lose 30 to 40 seats in the House and a few in the Senate too, easily wiping out razor-thin Democratic majorities,"" Bloomberg reported on Saturday.Democratic Party's favorability has been falling, due to Joe Biden administration's incompetence in handling foreign and domestic affairs. Inflation at a 40-year high has gravely impacted ordinary people's life in the US and domestic racial conflict and populism are also rampant. Joe Biden's promises in 2020 election campaign on unity and restoring prosperity have fallen short. ""Democrats suffering defeats in the upcoming midterm elections is a high probability event,"" said a Beijing-based expert on international relations who asked for anonymity.For the moment, given the difficulty of a significant improvement in terms of economy, politics and diplomacy, the Democratic Party seems to be willing to take risky gambits to rescue its unfavorable electoral situation.According to Song Zhongping, a China military expert and TV commentator, this can explain why US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is taking desperate actions, constantly hyping her potential visit to Taiwan, for playing the ""Taiwan card"" and exaggerating the ""China threat theory"" can boost her popularity in the US. The declining approval ratings will likely lead Democrats to make more aggressive provocations against other countries in the run-up to the upcoming midterm elections, which deserves vigilance from the international community.""On the other hand, the Joe Biden administration may escalate support to Ukraine in the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict. We should also not rule out the possibility that the US will provide Ukraine with more advanced weapons and equipment, including high lethality weaponry, to stem the Joe Biden administration's slump in popularity,"" noted Song.""As a result, ahead of the mid-term election, the Russia-Ukraine military conflict may become more critical and US's confrontations with Beijing and Moscow may step up. In addition, in order to court arms dealers and win their support, Democrats will also play the card in favor of arms sale, ramping up the arms race on a global scale, which will add to global instability. In a word, one cannot rule out the possibility that the US may rush hastily into danger, causing more trouble in order to serve their electoral politics.The US' elections are an important manifestation of partisan competition. Under the current circumstances, no matter what Democrats do, the Republicans will exploit it as a subject for criticism to score more votes. However if the Democrats take risks, this will be a double-edged sword. When the Joe Biden administration plays the Taiwan card, no matter what actions it takes, the Republican Party will label it as a weak move. Yet if the Democrats face negative consequences as a result of being tough against China, they will certainly be accused of creating trouble for the US people. This is the US' political landscape, say the experts.""From the perspective of ordinary US people however, what they really care about is whether the government can boost the US' economy and promote their well-being. When such concern cannot be met, even if the ruling party makes more reckless moves, it cannot improve the Democrats' electoral odds,"" said Lü Xiang, an expert on US studies at the China Academy of Social Sciences.",OPINION,OBSERVER,"US President Joe Biden falls off his bicycle as he approaches well-wishers following a bike ride at Gordon's Pond State Park in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, on June 18, 2022.

95,"GT Voice: Australia digs a hole for EU, Asian allies with possible LNG move",Global Times,2022-08-01,"Weeks before the Russia-Ukraine conflict started, Australia's former prime minister Scott Morrison suggested Australia could step in and help when it comes to supplying its huge reserves of liquefied natural gas (LNG) to its EU allies. Awkwardly, some in Australia are now warning of a potential shortage in the country and urging to set aside gas for Australia's own electricity network before selling to the rest of the world.Australia said on Monday that it will consider whether to curb exports of LNG after the Australia Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) warned of a significant risk of a shortfall and soaring prices of domestic LNG next year, according to a Reuters report.How Australia manages its gas production and exports is, of course, planned in accordance with its own national interests. However, when the backlash from West sanctions against Russia endangered all parties involved in the sanctions, Australia's first concern was its own interests. This reflects the difficulties of coordination within the West. It is foreseeable that as sanctions and counter-sanctions intensify, more complex disputes of interests will emerge within the West camp. The cracks in West coherence will widen.In its latest interim report, the ACCC said that Australia's east coast gas market could face a shortfall of 10 percent to the forecast domestic demand, which is why extra gas is needed to supply the gap.The development is both laughable and serious - laughable, because this reflects Australia officials' overconfidence and arrogance in making empty promises it cannot deliver; serious, because a potential move could significantly affect already disrupted global energy supplies, given that Australia is known as one of the world's top LNG exporters.As the Russia-Ukraine conflict continues, the international demand for LNG has increased significantly. At this juncture, if Australia decides to impose export restrictions on its LNG that hasn't been sold under long-term contracts, no matter how small the amount is in the global market, a call to cut global supplies is enough to generate a significant negative impact on global markets. Ironically, a potential Australia restriction on its LNG exports might hurt some of its EU and Asia allies the most.With countries competing to ensure the supply stability and security of traditional fossil fuels, the fear of a potential disruption to traditional energy supplies has forced governments, not just in EU, but also in Asia, to step up LNG purchases for the winter. Many, especially those in Asia, like Japan and South Korea, have turned to Australia. But the majority of Australia's LNG is sold under long-term contracts, and it is impossible for Australia to raise its gas output in the short term. So it's nothing but an empty promise for officials like Morrison to say that Australia will help its allies in need.In EU, since capacity in the key Nord Stream 1 pipeline, which connects Russia with Germany, was first cut to 40 percent in June, the EU benchmark TTF contract has more than doubled from the level it traded at in early June. Because of their high dependence on Russia energy supplies, EU countries have been stockpiling gas in preparation for the winter in case Russia cuts off their gas supplies. Germany, for example, has set up a plan that requires gas storage facilities to be filled to 75 percent of capacity by September 1, 85 percent by October 1 and 95 percent by November 1.It is clear that a possible reduction in Australia's LNG exports would further exacerbate the global energy crisis and push up prices, while increasing the energy anxiety in countries that used to see Australia as a reliable source of supplies. Some of its allies may also be annoyed by Australia's inability to actually offer help in areas where it apparently has an advantage.China has made efforts in recent years to diversify its energy imports amid tensions with Australia. For example, in 2021, the country signed six LNG contracts with the US and none with Australia.But as a major energy importer and consumer, China will inevitably be affected by the fluctuations in the global energy market. To hedge against geopolitical risks, China is expected to further explore more diverse energy supplies to ensure security. Any move by Australia will not fundamentally undermine China's energy security.",SOURCE,GT VOICE,Photo: Xinhua,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'Russia': ('LOC', 3), 'Ukraine': ('LOC', 2), 'Australia': ('LOC', 12), 'Asia': ('LOC', 3), 'Japan': ('LOC', 1), 'South': ('LOC', 1), 'Scott Morrison': ('PER', 1), 'EU': ('ORG', 3), 'Australia Competition and Consumer Commission': ('ORG', 1), 'ACCC': ('ORG', 2), 'Reuters': ('ORG', 1), 'West': ('MISC', 4)}"

98,Ukraine crisis won't harm the BRI as West claims,Liu Zongyi,2022-08-02,"The Russia-Ukraine conflict has profoundly changed the geopolitical landscape and trend of the world, with significant implications for China, both positive and negative. Now some officials and scholars in the US and the West are hyping the damage caused by the conflict to the China-proposed Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), especially to the railway freight route connecting China and EU via Kazakhstan, Russia and Belarus, and using it as a pretext to ask China to put pressure on Russia, which is mainly a West narrative to sow discord in relations between China and Russia.Of course, the BRI has been negatively impacted by the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Firstly, the Eurasian Land Bridge has been directly affected. The China-EU Railway Express' primary route westward has been through Russia, Belarus, Poland, or the Baltic coast. The route through Ukraine has been cut off by the war. It also no longer stops in Lithuania. Secondly, China's investments in Ukraine have been impacted by the war. This largely included wind power and photovoltaic fields. Thirdly, to some extent, China-EU trade has been affected by the conflict, although not greatly. The cargo trade between China and EU is mainly by sea, with railway transportation accounting for only 5 percent. However, due to EU sanctions against Russia, many EU operators have also decided to withdraw from transportation through Russia and Belarus.From the perspective of China's interests and the interests of Ukraine, Russia and other EU countries, we hope that the war can be ended as soon as possible, the problem be solved through negotiation, peace be restored as soon as possible, and normal economic operation be resumed.The deteriorating relations between Russia and the West have led economic relations between China and Russia to become closer, with all of Russia's political, business and economic circles turning their eyes to China. Reliance on China goods has also increased to replace West ones.In addition, it has energized China's BRI and Russia's Greater Eurasian partnership, which include greater cooperation with states in Central Asia and Mongolia. As EU countries seek trade routes which do not need to go through Russia, this has also diversified trade and commercial routes of the BRI to include new China-EU railway links through the trans-Caspian and Black Sea routes.In the long term BRI cooperation between China and EU may be strengthened. The negative impact of the Russia-Ukraine conflict on the EU economy is significant and will create further pre-requisites for China-EU cooperation. The world's largest market is in Asia, and the connection with China and East Asia markets is the fundamental way out for the development of the EU. Promoting the shift of global industrial chains and supply chains out of ideological purposes cannot change this objective fact.In the future, the BRI is also likely to focus more on China's periphery, especially Southeast Asia. The opening of the China-Laos railway, progress on the China-Laos-Thai-Railway will open new opportunities. This will coincide with the China-Vietnam railway to make a network. China's trade with Southeast Asia is about $800 billion a year. China and ASEAN have RCEP, China-ASEAN Free Trade Agreement and other soft mechanisms. ASEAN focuses on economic development, not to choose sides between China and the US.The Russia-Ukraine conflict will also lead China to choose countries with a more stable situation to build BRI projects, including in green development, health and digital economy, aware of the US' intention to cause trouble and to create proxy wars. The Federal Reserve's interest rate hikes have left many developing countries in economic crisis, which the US has sought to blame on China. However, the destruction of the economic and political stability of these countries by the US will have a backfire effect in the long run.China will learn the lessons from the impact of the Russia-Ukraine conflict and West sanctions on Russia. China-US competition over the BRI is a battle over rules and standards. The sanctions the West unilaterally slapped on Russia will undercut West credibility and the universality of US-led standards across the board, showing the consequences of relying on the US-led system, giving China and others the opportunity to promote alternatives.The author is secretary-general of the Research Center for China-South Asia Cooperation at the Shanghai Institutes for International Studies, and distinguished fellow of the China (Kunming) South Asia & Southeast Asia Institute. opinion@globaltimes.com.cn",OPINION,VIEWPOINT,"A cross-border e-commerce freight train from Hamburg of Germany arriving in Xi'an, northwest China's Shaanxi Province.

99,Africa needs concrete measures of cooperation instead of empty promises,Lin Songtian,2022-08-02,"As US Special Envoy for the Horn of Africa Mike Hammer completed his Africa trip including visits to Egypt, the United Arab Emirates, and Ethiopia on Monday, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken is expected to travel this week to South Africa, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Rwanda.Africa is full of hope and development vitality. Driven by the strong impetus of China-Africa cooperation, 20 Africa countries have achieved an annual GDP growth rate of over 5 percent before COVID-19 pandemic. However, it is regrettable that the world today is confronted with profound changes and a pandemic, both unseen in a century. The Ukraine crisis triggered by geopolitics and a Cold War mentality has seriously damaged the security of global industrial, supply and capital chains, and led to a global food, energy and financial crisis, making the people around the world, especially those in Africa and other less developed countries, innocent victims.We should remain particularly vigilant that developed countries have concentrated their attention and funds on ideological and bloc confrontation, and politicized mutually beneficial economic and trade cooperation, which has further marginalized Africa, and made Africa people suffer from severe production and survival crisis as well as threat of famine. The motives of West policy toward Africa are impure. West countries, led by the US, do not want to see Africa realize self-sustainable development, nor do they want to see the rapid development of China-Africa cooperation. They are worried about China's growing influence on Africa brought about by increased China-Africa cooperation. What they can do is fabricate lies, mislead international public opinion, and make every attempt to undermine the friendly and mutually beneficial cooperation between China and Africa. The US and other West countries have established a number of initiatives or cooperation plans with Africa, claiming to increase infrastructure investment in Africa and other developing countries. However, all of them are aimed at hedging against the influence of China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), rather than truly supporting Africa's own self-sustainable development.In addition, the Africa Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA), asserting to promote trade between the US and Africa, sets many additional conditions for beneficiary countries, and uses trade preferences as means to suppress those who fail to meet the US' requirement, which has led it to become a political tool for the US to pressure Africa countries. The US has removed a number of Africa countries from AGOA, and revoked their duty-free trade access to the US.West investment in Africa has shown inadequacy in both energy and capital. In recent years, the US and other West countries have been deeply trapped in their own political predicaments and faced multiple challenges such as economic recession, soaring CPI, political polarization, wealth inequality, racial conflicts, social unrest and rampant epidemic. They are busy creating troubles to divert public attention away from domestic conflicts, and hardly talk or care about Africa's development.According to a report released by the Infrastructure Consortium for Africa in 2018, estimates of Africa's financing requirements for annual infrastructure investment range from $130 billion to $170 billion. In its 2021 Report Card for US's Infrastructure, the US Society of Civil Engineers said that the US alone faces $2.59 trillion in infrastructure needs over 10 years, meaning a funding gap of $259 billion per year. With its domestic demand not yet satisfied, how can the US address Africa's urgent needs?Due to China's influence, G7 leaders announced the Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment (PGII) at the G7 summit not long ago, pledging to raise $600 billion for infrastructure investment, among which the US claims to mobilize $200 billion in public and private funds rather than direct funding by the government. The earlier B3W, which the US pledged to provide $40 trillion, turned out to be nowhere to be found. Now, for the G7 multilateral initiative, the US can barely raise $200 billion. In its cooperation with Africa, the West pays lip service only but delivers little. From Obama's Power Africa to Donald Trump's Prosperity Africa, from last year's B3W to this year's PGII, there has never been short of empty promises or beautiful words. What is missing is actions. The Power Africa promised to invest and produce 20,000 megawatts of electricity in Africa by 2020. According to statistics, by the end of 2020, actual power generation was only 4,194 megawatts, less than a quarter of the promised amount. Prosperity Africa delivers even less. It's been nearly a year since the B3W was announced, but the US government has invested a mere $6 million in global infrastructure, much less from its commitment of $40 trillion, no more different from a pie in the sky.China pursues the new path of win-win cooperation for common development and shall never adopt the old mindset of a zero-sum game. China has been committed to developing relations with other countries on the basis of mutual respect, equality, mutual benefit, mutual learning and common development. We stand ready to share without reservation our development experience, opportunities and achievements with Africa.China's policy toward Africa has a clear goal and is action-oriented. The only purpose is to support Africa countries in improving their capacity for self-sustainable development, breaking the development bottlenecks of inadequate infrastructure, lack of professional and skilled personnel and shortage of financial resources, so as to achieve win-win cooperation for common development.China's Policy toward Africa is open and transparent. The political declarations and action plans for every three years, adopted after consultation at each conference of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation, are all open to the public through media and serve as the common guidelines and measures of China-Africa cooperation.Africa has been eager to pursue its own development and international cooperation, but there is never a lack of catchy strategic slogans from major powers. Africa needs concrete measures and actions of mutually beneficial international cooperation instead of empty promises. Africa requires equality and mutual respect instead of preaching by lectures. Africa wants capacity building for self-sustainable development instead of simple export of raw materials. Africa welcomes win-win cooperation for common development instead of ""one gain, one loss."" Whoever helps Africa break the three development bottlenecks is Africa's true friend and reliable partner.China is willing to vigorously carry out multilateral cooperation for multi-win and win-win outcomes among China, Africa and other countries on the basis of fully respecting Africa's wishes, so as to bring the marginalized Africa back to the main track of development, help Africa achieve lasting peace, self-sustainable development, and make new contributions to building a community with a shared future for mankind.The author is president of the China People's Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries. opinion@globaltimes.com.cn",OPINION,VIEWPOINT,China-Africa relations Illustration: Liu Rui/GT,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'US': ('LOC', 8), 'Horn of Africa': ('LOC', 21), 'Egypt': ('LOC', 1), 'United Arab Emirates': ('LOC', 1), 'Ethiopia': ('LOC', 1), 'South Africa': ('LOC', 21), 'Democratic Republic of Congo': ('LOC', 1), 'Rwanda': ('LOC', 1), 'Ukraine': ('LOC', 1), 'Mike Hammer': ('PER', 1), 'Antony Blinken': ('PER', 1), 'China': ('MISC', 6), 'COD': ('MISC', 1), 'Cold War': ('MISC', 1), 'West': ('MISC', 3), 'BR': ('ORG', 1)}"

The hashtag on the topic has received at least 42.5 million views, with many netizens seeing it as a clear warning to Pelosi, who could make a surprise and provocative trip to China's Taiwan island.Citing ""officials"", Taiwan-based Next TV on Monday said Pelosi is expected to stay in Taipei overnight at the Grand Hyatt hotel in Xinyi district, but it's unclear exactly when she will arrive. CNN also released similar information, saying that ""Pelosi is expected to visit Taiwan as part of her tour of Asia,"" according to a senior official from the Taiwan authorities and a US official. China Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian also said at a routine Monday press conference, ""If you play with fire, you will get burned. I believe the US is fully aware of the strong and clear message delivered by China.""If Pelosi visits the island of Taiwan, ""the PLA will not sit idly by"" and will take ""resolute and strong countermeasures"" to protect China's sovereignty and territorial integrity. As to what these measures are, Zhao said ""if she dares to go, let's wait and see.""What the US should do now is to fulfill US President Joe Biden's promise of not supporting ""Taiwan Independence"" secessionism, and not arrange for House Speaker Pelosi to visit the island of Taiwan, Zhao stressed while answering questions related to Pelosi's Asia trip. China analysts said this new warning is a clear signal that if Pelosi goes to Taiwan, China will see it as a provocative action permitted by the Joe Biden administration rather than a personal decision made by Pelosi, and it would be a serious incident that means the US has violated its promise. Lü Xiang, an expert on US studies at the China Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times on Monday that any arrangement serving Pelosi's visit to Taiwan would be a breach of the White House's commitment not to support ""Taiwan independence.""""Arrangement"" refers to any assistance provided by the administration (including from the US military) for the visit, in particular, transportation, security, communications, intelligence, and so on, Lü said. If Pelosi really goes to Taiwan, ""my understanding is that it has received Joe Biden's permission, and the US military will also provide support to her,"" he said. This means China's retaliation will not just target Pelosi, the Joe Biden administration will also have to face the serious consequence of a comprehensive setback of China-US relations, analysts said. China's strategic view is far greater than just playing a game of hawk-and-chicken with Pelosi on her so-called surprise visit to the island, as China will use this provocative move by the US to irreversibly change the Taiwan Straits situation and speed up the reunification process, which is actually much more important than a US politician's visit, said experts.If the US believes Pelosi's adventurist move can open a new door for US on the Taiwan question, that would be too naive, said experts, noting that it could only end the US strategy of coercion on Taiwan. No one should underestimate China's determination for its reunification and rejuvenation, and the Russia-Ukraine crisis has just let the world see the consequence of pushing a major power into a corner, said analysts. China will steadily speed up its process of reunification and declare the end of US domination of the world order, they said.And Pelosi's stubbornness and selfishness would mark the beginning of the end of US hegemony, analysts noted.

(Photo by Ting Shen/Xinhua)Politico reported that the Pentagon is preparing for Pelosi's potential Taiwan trip, and is likely to offer a military aircraft. Pelosi said on Friday that she wants Congress ""to be part of Joe Biden administration's strategy in the Indo-Pacific,"" according to media.  On Sunday, the RFI reported that Pelosi will fly to Taiwan island via the Philippines' Clark Air Base on August 4 and meet with the island's regional leader Tsai Ing-wen. Taiwan-based media reported that aircraft from the PLA, the US military and the Taiwan authorities entered Taiwan's self-proclaimed southwest air defense identification zone on Monday morning. It said the treacherous atmosphere was caused by Pelosi's potential visit. Wait in resolute arrayMonday also marks the first day of Pelosi's Asia tour, which runs from August 1 to 5 and includes Singapore, Malaysia, South Korea and Japan according to her announced itinerary, but a Taiwan tour is still up in the air. One day before Pelosi's Asia trip, China's PLA conducted mock air combat training after midnight, with the aim of improving the pilots' ability to quickly enter combat status for abnormal situations at any time. This is a clear signal sent by the PLA that China is fully capable of setting up an all-weather defense for intercepting any aircraft seeking to enter the island from any direction, said experts. Analysts suggested that the PLA could send warplanes to intercept her plane should she attempt to land in Taiwan.

A grand national flag-raising ceremony is held at Tian'anmen Square in Beijing as China marks the 95th anniversary of the founding of the People's Liberation Army, on August 1, 2022. Thousands of people came to witness the flag being raised as the sun rose. Photo: VCGAccording to the latest ship tracking information, the USS Ronald Reagan, which is likely to be escorting Pelosi, has entered the Philippine Sea. Analysts said its path and deployment is likely cooperating with Pelosi's schedule.Whether Pelosi visits or not, China needs to maintain the ability to drive out enemies regularly across the Taiwan Straits, and be prepared to face military conflicts brought about by the US and Japan's intervention, China military expert Song Zhongping told the Global Times. He called for the establishment of a danger zone to deal with the situation of entering Taiwan airspace.Fu Qianshao, a China military aviation expert, told the Global Times that China's military aircraft are capable of regular patrols around the island of Taiwan. In addition, the PLA army, navy and air force are far more capable of intercepting and striking than they were during the Taiwan Straits crisis of 1996.""If Pelosi's aircraft enters our exercise area, we would have to take measures to eject, intercept, escort, and send a radio warning… If Pelosi gets her way, our warplanes may fire shells diagonally ahead of Pelosi's plane as a further warning,"" Fu said. Fu said that in the ""first island chain,"" China's military advantage is much greater than that of the US military, and if there is a real military conflict, the US military escort will not be of much use in protecting Pelosi. ""If Pelosi were to land at Taipei's Songshan Airport on a US military executive flight C-40, would the accompanying escorts be expected to land with her in Taipei as well? Any landing of US military aircraft would be a serious violation of China's red line and would create a bigger crisis on top of Pelosi's,"" said Herman Shuai, a retired army lieutenant general in the island of Taiwan.Chiu Yi, a Taiwan-based cross-Straits expert, told the Global Times that it is highly likely that Pelosi will enter Taiwan from the eastern side of the island, avoiding the West side where the PLA is heavily deployed.""But isn't it hilarious that the No 3. political figure in the world's No.1 country is hiding like a rat and being smug about it? "" Chiu said.No matter how Pelosi comes to Taiwan, the PLA's prepared countermeasures will be implemented, and neither a shorter nor a lower profile stay would result in a lower intensity response, Lü said.  The China mainland could declare regular airspace control over all or part of the island if Pelosi made the visit, the expert said, ""If the US moves one step forward on the Taiwan question, China will move two.""In the future, it may conduct flights close to the island and emphasize jurisdiction over the region's airspace and territorial waters, Lü said.  China has no interest in getting involved in a spat with an 82-year-old lady, nor is it aiming for conflict with the US military, but if they get involved in China's core interests, we will definitely fight back in kind, Lü said.He said Pelosi's trip to Asia will not be welcomed by the most countries in Asia, as the losses from any possible conflict would be huge for the region rather than the US.",CHINA,DIPLOMACY,"A naval fleet comprised of the guided-missile destroyers Ningbo (Hull 139) and Taiyuan (Hull 131), as well as the guided-missile frigate Nantong (Hull 601), steams in astern formation in waters of the East China Sea during a maritime training drill.

101,UN chief welcomes 1st sailing of vessel from Ukraine's Odesa under grain export deal,Xinhua,2022-08-02,"UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Monday welcomed the first commercial vessel sailing from Ukraine's Odesa under the Black Sea Grain Initiative brokered by the UN and Türkiye.The cargo ship loaded with more than 26,000 tons of corn should arrive at the inspection location in Turkey territorial waters on Tuesday. Following inspection, it will proceed to its final destination in Tripoli, Lebanon, said Guterres.""This ship, the Merchant Vessel Razoni, is loaded with two commodities in short supply: corn, and hope. Hope for millions of people around the world who depend on the smooth running of Ukraine's ports to feed their families,"" he told reporters.The ship's departure is the first concrete result of the Black Sea Grain Initiative. ""Today's departure is an enormous collective achievement by the Joint Coordination Center, set up last week in Istanbul under UN auspices, with representatives from Ukraine, Russia, and Türkiye,"" Guterres said.The Black Sea Grain Initiative, signed by Russia and Ukraine with Türkiye under the UN on July 22, would allow significant volumes of food and fertilizer exports from three key Ukraine ports in the Black Sea, namely Odesa, Chernomorsk and Yuzhny.The deal aims to ensure the safe passage for ships carrying grain to world markets amid concerns about food shortages due to the prolonged crisis in Ukraine.""What we've witnessed today in Odesa is an important starting point. It must be the first of many commercial ships bringing relief and stability to global food markets,"" said Guterres.""Together with the agreed facilitation of the unimpeded access of Russia food products and fertilizers to world markets, it will bring relief and stability to global food markets and help tackle the global food crisis,"" he added.Ensuring that grain, fertilizers, and other food-related items are available at reasonable prices to developing countries is a humanitarian imperative. People on the verge of famine need these agreements to work, in order to survive. Countries on the verge of bankruptcy need these agreements to work, in order to keep their economies alive, he said.In line with the humanitarian spirit of the initiative, the World Food Programme is planning to purchase, load and ship an initial 30,000 metric tons of wheat out of Ukraine on a UN-chartered vessel, said the UN chief.The conflict in Ukraine must end, and peace must be established, in line with the UN Charter and international law, he said. ""I hope today's news can be a step toward that goal, for the people of Ukraine and Russia, and for the world.""While this tragic conflict continues to rage, the UN is working every day to bring relief to the people of Ukraine, and to those suffering the effects of the conflict around the world, he said.The parties to the initiative have worked tirelessly to reach this milestone, with the support of the UN and Türkiye, he noted.""After speaking to my colleagues, I know they worked practically all night, sleeping for just one hour -- like all the other delegations at the Joint Coordination Center (in Istanbul). It is thanks to their commitment that the Razoni was able to leave Odesa safely. I salute their efforts, and I am grateful to Türkiye for its leadership,"" he said.In a press release, the Joint Coordination Center (JCC), which was established under the Black Sea Grain Initiative, affirmed that it has authorized the Razoni to sail from Odesa.""The JCC has agreed to the specific coordinates and restrictions of the Safe Humanitarian Maritime Corridor and has communicated those details in accordance with international navigation procedures.

102,"US bears full responsibility for all consequences of Pelosi's Taiwan visit, China warns",Chen Qingqing,2022-08-02,"As the world closely followed the visit of US House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi to Taiwan on Tuesday evening that is widely described as provocative and dangerous, the Joe Biden administration gave more chicanery in distancing itself by stressing it was her personal choice and continued hollowing out the one-China principle that serves as the foundation of China-US relations. China officials and experts warned that all the consequences of this highly dangerous and provocative move will be borne by US, and such visit will also forever change the cross-Straits situation and deliver a destructive impact on the already-difficult China-US relations. China Vice Foreign Minister Xie Feng summoned US Ambassador to China Nicholas Burns on early Wednesday morning to protest against Pelosi's visit to Taiwan island. The nature of Pelosi's visit is extremely vicious and the consequence is very grave. The China side will not sit idly by, Xie told Burns.  Shortly after Pelosi arrived at the Taipei's Songshan airport, five China authorities including the China Foreign Ministry, Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, Taiwan Affairs Office of the CPC Central Committee, Foreign Affairs Committee of the China People's Political Consultative Conference National Committee and the Ministry of National Defense issued statements condemning the visit, noting it seriously damages the political foundation of China-US relations and sends a wrong message to ""Taiwan independence""forces. On Tuesday evening just a few hours ahead of the planned arrival time of Pelosi in Taiwan, China State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi stressed China's solemn position, warning that some US politicians who selfishly play with fire on the Taiwan question will become the enemies to 1.4 billion China people, and won't meet with a good end. This serves as a final warning to the US to stop it from falling to the cliff, experts said.   Wang also said the US has violated its promise and is being treacherous on the Taiwan question, noting such behavior is beneath contempt.Ahead of Pelosi's visit to the island, some key White House officials tried to downplay the visit and shift the blame to China. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken told reporters on Monday that Pelosi ""will make her own decisions about whether or not to visit Taiwan. The Congress is an independent, coequal branch of government. The decision is entirely the speaker's."" Antony Blinken also said that members of Congress routinely go to the island, and ""so if the speaker does decide to visit and China tries to create some kind of crisis or otherwise escalate tensions, that would be entirely on Beijing,"" according to media reports. ""Antony Blinken's words confound black with white, and exposes the hegemonic mindset of some US politicians, which is 'I can make provocations against you as I please, but you cannot reject them or act in self-defense,'"" Hua Chunying, spokesperson of the China Foreign Ministry, said at a press briefing on Tuesday. It's worth noting that after Hua was promoted to the position of assistant foreign minister, she rarely appeared at the ministry's daily press briefing. Tuesday's appearance was the first one in 159 days since the outbreak of the Russia-Ukraine military conflict, hinting on the seriousness of Pelosi's planned visit. Hua also fully elaborated on China's positions on the issue through five points from the legal basis to the historical background to US' China containment strategy. In the three US-China Joint Communiqués, the US recognized the government of the China is the sole legal government representing the whole of China and within that context, the US people would continue to maintain cultural, commercial and other unofficial relations with the people of Taiwan. But as the No.3 political figure in the US, the US House of Representatives Speaker plans to take an aircraft of the US military to visit Taiwan, which is absolutely not a non-official act, Hua said. Besides Antony Blinken, who mentioned the previous visit of the House Speaker to Taiwan, John Kirby, a National UN spokesperson, also described this potential visit ""not uncommon"" and also repeated on multiple occasions that ""nothing has changed"" with regards to US' ""One China Policy,"" recognizing Taiwan as part of China, CNN said.Previous mistakes made by certain US politicians do not make the following mistake legitimate, and the US shouldn't make more mistakes on the Taiwan question, Hua said. Ignoring the consecutive stern warnings from the China government over the trip, senior White House officials and US hawks continued hollowing out and blurring the one-China principle, letting its domestic laws override international laws, coming up with a series of wrong concepts and claims about the Taiwan question - the most important and sensitive issue within the China-US relations, China experts said. The White House has lost the power of defining China-related policies including those concerning Taiwan to the Congress, reflecting the weakness and incapability of the Joe Biden administration and its latest promise to the China government on the matter could be ""a slap in the face,"" experts noted. China won't let Pelosi's visit serve as a bad example for other US allies to play the Taiwan card. In addition, senior China officials have been repeatedly warning about the grave consequences of the trip, not only on the cross-Straits relations but also to the China-US relations, which have already been deteriorating over the past few years due to US's misconceptions and misjudgment about Beijing. Cognitive warfare US officials have been increasingly taking bold actions to hollow out its ""one China"" policy and adopting a ""salami-slicing"" approach to erode the principle, for instance, by removing the wording on not supporting ""Taiwan independence"" in the US State Department website's section on relations with Taiwan in May, playing tricks to obscure the perception that China has the absolute sovereignty over the island and frequently hyping up the false claims that Taiwan Straits is international waters and sending lawmakers to visit the island. ""The US is unwilling to talk about the legal basis of the Taiwan question, as for the legal basis, no matter it's international law or the three joint communiqués between China and the US, their arguments won't make any sense,"" Lü Xiang, an expert on US studies at the China Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times on Tuesday. The US is using its so-called ""one China"" policy including the Taiwan Relations Act and the Six Assurances to override the one-China principle and playing some tricks such as encouraging some small countries like Lithuania to challenge China's sovereignty, increasing the arms sale to Taiwan island and provocatively sending warships through the Taiwan Straits, and ""there are tons of such examples,"" Lü said. In recent years, the US claimed that it adheres to the one-China principle but it has been acting backward and even hollowing out the one-China principle, the spokesperson of the China Foreign Ministry said. ""It has not only inserted the so-called 'Taiwan Relations Act' and 'the Six Assurances' - both were unilaterally fabricated into its 'one-China policy' and it also violates the commitment of not engaging with the island officially and increasing arms sale,"" Hua said, noting that many people in the US and in international community pointed out the danger of those moves. US to bear consequences China experts believe that China's strategic view is far greater than just playing a game of hawk-and-chicken with Pelosi on her so-called surprise visit to the island, as China will use this provocative move by the US to irreversibly change the Taiwan Straits situation and speed up the reunification process, which is actually much more important than a US politician's visit. If the US believes Pelosi's adventurist move can open a new door for US on the Taiwan question, that would be too naive, said experts, noting that it could only end US' strategy of coercion on Taiwan. The experts added that no one should underestimate China's determination for its reunification and rejuvenation, and the Russia-Ukraine crisis has just let the world see the consequence of pushing a major power into a corner. ""China won't allow another case like 'Pelosi's visit' to happen again, which means we won't let this visit to set a bad example for more countries such as the UK, France and Germany to follow suit, further hollowing out our sovereignty over Taiwan,"" Lü said.  As part of consecutive warnings, the China Foreign Ministry spokesperson warned again on Tuesday that the US should abandon any attempt of playing the Taiwan card, faithfully abide by the one-China principle. ""If the US insists on pursuing the wrong course of action, it will assume full responsibility for all serious consequences arising therefrom,"" she said. China's reaction will not just be a momentary action but will consider the whole security mechanism of Taiwan, Lü noted. When it comes to the countermeasures, the China expert said the China mainland will exercise its sovereignty and rights of control over the airspace on the island and adjacent sea areas around the island, to make sure no other case like 'Pelosi's visit' could happen again, and to better safeguard national sovereignty.""""For the China-US relations that have already encountered many difficulties, the visit would deal another heavy blow not only to the China-US relations but also to the world order,"" a Beijing-based expert on international relations who preferred not to be identified told the Global Times.",CHINA,DIPLOMACY,China-US Photo: VCG,"Reporter, Beijing","Chen Qingqing co-leads the Global Times China desk.

103,"Internal systematic flaws divide US, lead the country toward being ungovernable",Song Luzheng,2022-08-02,"The US has shaken itself and the world in recent months. US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's potential visit to Taiwan island has significantly escalated tensions between China and the US. In June, the Supreme Court eliminated the constitutional right to an abortion. The enraged public immediately took to the streets, sparking a storm of protests around the US. In a rare move, not only did UN Human Rights officials, but also the leaders of US allies UK, France, New Zealand and Canada criticized the ruling.From the perspective of political science, both incidents are very puzzling. The US is facing external challenges including the Russia-Ukraine conflict and instable relations with China under China-US strategic competition and has to deal with internal woes such as a new wave of COVID-19 resurgence, high inflation and the risk of recession. It is indeed in a situation whereby ""a spark can ignite a fire."" In such a context, US elites should focus on dealing with these unprecedented challenges and crises regardless of their positions and try to put out the fire, instead of adding fuel to it. They need to do something to give the country a chance to breathe and develop. However, under the separation of powers, the Supreme Court and the House of Representatives are doing the opposite thing. Pelosi is 82 years old. Considering the possibility that Democrats may lose the midterm elections, she will likely no longer serve as the speaker of the House of Representatives and retire from the stage of history. So why did she choose to make such a rash and reckless move? The Russia-Ukraine conflict has lasted for five months, and the contest of strength and will power between the two sides has reached a critical moment. The bitter consequences of the war are also being comprehensively presented. Apart from high prices and a slowing economy in EU and the US, other developing countries are confronting a basic survival crisis. Sri Lanka, which declared the country bankrupt, was the first one in this context. Is Pelosi attempting to shift attention from Russia when she chooses this moment to provoke China's core interests?From the perspective of institutional structure, the US is one of the few countries that implement the separation of powers. The judicial and legislative branches will not consider the overall situation, let alone have an international perspective. This can be said to be a problem in the genes of institutional design.Yet the system is just a framework in any country, and there are many conditions for it to function well. Among them, the most important is that social elites must have consensus on major principles. Otherwise, countries will fail to function well, and their institution itself will collapse. The US today is in its most divided domestic condition since the Civil War, and US cannot compromise with each other. This split is not only the traditional rivalry between the ruling party and the opposition counterpart, but also taking place within parties. Take the transition of power between administrations as the core of the US system. When the 2020 presidential election results came out, then US president Donald Trump refused to accept the election results, did not participate in the handover ceremony and even incited his supporters to occupy the Capitol Hill. But there are also many within the Republican Party who publicly disagree with Donald Trump. Former Republican presidents George H. W. Bush, and his son George W. Bush, did not vote for Donald Trump in 2016.Although its system can still accommodate different classes, it cannot address the contradictions amongst them, or even those within the same class. That's why we see one astonishing incident after another in which the US harms itself, or jeopardizes others without benefiting itself. This is just the beginning, however, and events and historic setbacks in the US that are beyond the global imagination will be seen in the future.The author is a research fellow at the China Institute, Fudan University. opinion@globaltimes.com.cn",OPINION,VIEWPOINT,Illustration: Chen Xia/Global Times,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'US': ('LOC', 9), 'Taiwan': ('LOC', 1), 'China': ('LOC', 4), 'UK': ('LOC', 1), 'France': ('LOC', 1), 'New Zealand': ('LOC', 1), 'Canada': ('LOC', 1), 'Russia': ('LOC', 3), 'Ukraine': ('LOC', 2), 'Sri Lanka': ('LOC', 1), 'US House': ('ORG', 1), 'Supreme Court': ('ORG', 2), 'UN Human Rights': ('ORG', 1), 'House of Representatives': ('ORG', 2), 'EU': ('ORG', 1), 'Nancy Pelosi': ('PER', 2), 'COVID': ('MISC', 1), '19': ('MISC', 1), 'Democrats': ('MISC', 1)}"
104,Chinese grain traders hope Black Sea deal to cover their stranded shipments soon,Chu Daye,2022-08-02,"As the first cargo ship left Ukraine's Odessa Port since the Russia-Ukraine conflict started in February, China grain traders said on Tuesday they are following the matter closely and some expressed hope that their stranded cargo could get the green light as soon as possible.The Sierra Leone-flagged Razoni, loaded with 26,000 tons of corn, is reportedly anchoring off Istanbul, the Turkey city that straddles the Bosporus Strait, on Tuesday after the UN, Turkey, Russia and Ukraine signed agreements to re-open Ukraine's Black Sea ports as part of efforts to address a growing global food shortage.China grain traders said that they are watching the matter with rapt attention, and one told the Global Times that they hope some of the vessels loaded with grain that was already paid for by China companies could get going as soon as possible.One trader who specialized in importing grain from Ukraine before the conflict told the Global Times on Tuesday that his company has a ship loaded with 60,000 tons of corn stranded in Port Yuzhnyi.""We had already paid for the cargo, but the ship has been stranded at the port since February. We hope our ship could get clearance to go as well. The grain inside the ship faces rising risks of going bad,"" the trader said on condition of anonymity. ""I estimate there are at least 10 loaded ships like ours in the region,"" the trader said. Another trader, who also spoke to the Global Times on condition of anonymity, said he is also following the situation and he has concerns about the capacity of the current arrangement to export grain from Ukraine, including wheat and corn. ""In the coming four months, there could be 3 million tons of grain coming out of Ukraine every month. Existing and new crops will total about 35 million tons, a big volume to be shipped out in the coming eight months, and the transportation could be an issue,"" the trader said.Ukraine is a major supplier of barley and corn to China, according to the Securities Times.US public broadcaster NPR reported on Monday that at least 68 vessels, about half loaded with grain, have been stuck in the country's Black Sea ports since February, citing the Ukraine Seaport Authority. A report by aljazeera.net put the number of vessels waiting to depart from Odessa at 16. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres tweeted on Monday that the ship departing from Odessa on Monday must be the first of many commercial ships bringing relief to global food markets. The conflict has reduced Ukraine grain exports to one-sixth of the pre-conflict level, while Russia's grain and fertilizer exports also dropped. Global grain prices soared, according to Al Jazeera.The deal, known officially as the Black Sea Grain Initiative, allows for significant volumes of exports from the ports of Odessa, Chernomorsk and Yuzhny.Experts said that grain imports from Ukraine are a worthy supplement to China's grain supply, especially for corn, which China has a big demand for in the sectors of edible oil production and pig farming. An official of the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs said that China's grain storage, including rough rice and wheat, is enough for a full year's consumption at a press conference on July 20.",SOURCE,ECONOMY,"The Sierra Leone-flagged dry cargo ship Razoni departs from the port of Odesa in Odessa, Ukraine on August 01, 2022.

105,US risks dragging whole world into a crisis through Pelosi’s provocation: Russian scholar,Global Times,2022-08-02,"I think that through Nancy Pelosi's provocative trip, the US intends to send five main messages. First of all, it's a provocation against China, and the US wants to look at the China reaction, or how deep China and China policy may go to react to this Taiwan question.The second point is that the US wants to show that they could act independently from the China declaration about Taiwan question and one-China policy. That's why the US, for the last more than 40 years, has supplied a lot of weapons to Taiwan island to increase its military capacity.The third point: The US wants to see that the China mainland will launch military action against [the island of] Taiwan, because in that case, China will be blamed as an aggressor as were Russia in Ukraine. If China doesn't, they will say that China is a chicken and that the position of China is really weak. The US wants to put China into a political and military crisis.The fourth point is very important: It's being done especially before the 20th [National] Congress of the Communist Party of China to try to destabilize the situation in China. The US tries to push from different sides and from different dimensions.And last but not least, the US really wants to drag the world into a global crisis, because all of US understand that when it was a question between the China mainland and Taiwan. But right now, the US wants to make this conflict international.So it means that if something happens in the Taiwan Straits, the global situation will change instantly in just one moment. And it will be a much more serious crisis than what we have right now in Ukraine. And because world trade is very heavily dependent on this region [Asia-Pacific region], not just because of China, but also because of Japan and South Korea, it means that the US really wants to crash the normal situation in the Asia-Pacific.China has a lot of means regarding how to react to the situation. For example, China could think about creating a new, larger camp of friendly countries, for example, including Russia and other nations, to establish a new world order step by step, not just in a few days and not just in few years. It could also launch a new logistic chain and step by step, to bring in more other countries, including in Asia and Africa.We should understand that it's not a question only about Pelosi's visit to Taiwan, as the US policy will be long-lasting. One day Joe Biden will leave office, but regardless, the new US president will more or less follow the same policy. So it means that we should understand that it's not a question of negotiations or bargaining. It's a question of the re-establishment of the new world order.The article was compiled by Global Times reporter Xia Wenxin based on an interview with Alexey Maslov, Director of the Institute of Asia and Africa Studies of Moscow State University. opinion@globaltimes.com.cn",OPINION,VIEWPOINT,Illustration:Liu Rui/GT,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'Nancy Pelosi': ('PER', 1), 'US': ('LOC', 11), 'China': ('LOC', 17), 'Russia': ('LOC', 2), 'Ukraine': ('LOC', 2), 'Taiwan Straits': ('LOC', 7), 'Asia': ('LOC', 3), 'Pacific': ('LOC', 2), 'Japan': ('LOC', 1), 'South Korea': ('LOC', 1), 'Africa': ('LOC', 1), 'one': ('MISC', 1), '20th': ('MISC', 1), 'National ] Congress of': ('ORG', 1), 'Communist Party of China': ('ORG', 1)}"
106,"Hua Chunying shows up 5 months after briefing on Russia-Ukraine crisis, denounces Pelosi's potential Taiwan visit 'stupid, dangerous gambling'",Global Times,2022-08-02,"Ahead of the potential visit of House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi to the island of Taiwan, China Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Hua Chunying gave a clear-cut message to the US in a rare appearance at the routine press conference on Tuesday, denouncing Pelosi's potential Taiwan visit as a ""stupid and dangerous gambling.""Hua, a spokesperson and previous head of the ministry's information department, was promoted to the position of Assistant Foreign Minister in October 2021. The last time she attended a foreign ministry's press briefing was 159 days ago on February 24, when Russia's military operation in Ukraine started. As part of the US government, the US Congress should naturally adhere to the foreign policies recognized and committed by the US government. It is definitely not an unofficial act for a House of Representatives Speaker - the No. 3 top official in the US government - to visit Taiwan island on a US military plane, Hua noted. Hua said the entire world clearly knows that it is US' provocations that have escalated tension across the Taiwan Straits. The US must take full responsibility for it … What US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said was to confuse right and wrong which once again revealed the hegemony mindset and gangster logic of some US officials. Antony Blinken said on Monday that a potential visit to Taiwan by House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi would be entirely her decision, but called on China not to escalate tensions in the event of a visit, Reuters reported. ""If the speaker does decide to visit and China tries to create some kind of crisis or otherwise escalate tensions, that would be entirely on Beijing,"" Antony Blinken said after nuclear nonproliferation talks at the UN.Asked what countermeasures would China take if Pelosi visits the island, Hua said, ""what I can tell you is that the US must bear responsibility and pay the price for causing harms on China's sovereignty and security interests.''Amid Pelosi's possible visit to the island of Taiwan, which media reported could happen Tuesday evening, both aircraft carriers of the China People's Liberation Army (PLA) Navy have reportedly moved out from their homeports respectively.Meanwhile, military trainings in both Bohai Sea and China Sea were issued respectively from Tuesday to Saturday. The Fujian Provincial Military Command neighboring Taiwan island also posted videos and pictures on Tuesday about a live-fire exercise, which aims to ""test overall combat capability under complex conditions."" The China spokesperson said the wrong actions of some US politicians should not set a precedent, still less become an excuse for the US to compound its mistakes on the Taiwan question.The fact and status quo that Taiwan island belongs to China is clear in history. China firmly oppose ""Taiwan independence"" and interference by external forces, and will never leave any space for any form of ""Taiwan independence"" forces, Hua noted. She continued, saying the China government and China people remain a consistent position over Taiwan question. It is the firm will of the 1.4 billion China people to resolutely safeguard China's sovereignty and territorial integrity, also a common aspiration of all China nationals to realize the reunification of the motherland.Hua urged the US to abandon its attempt to play the Taiwan card and live up to its words and deeds, strictly abiding by the one-China principle, and implementing the three China-US joint communiqués. In 1979, the US government clearly committed in the joint communiqués that it recognizes the China as the sole legal government of China, and within this context, the people of the US will maintain cultural, commercial and other unofficial relations with the people of Taiwan.One-China principle is an international basic principle and common consensus of the international community. Based on the principle, China established diplomatic ties with 181 countries including the US. The US verbally claimed its insistency on the one-China policy but its deeds continue to go backward, even hollowing the one-China principle out, the China Foreign Ministry spokesperson said.No matter what excuse Pelosi employs for visiting China's island, it's stupid, unnecessary and dangerous gambling. It's hard to imagine a more reckless and provocative action than her visit. Such sayings have been frequently seen among many mainstream US media, intelligence and some former officials of US allied countries, the spokesperson. Hua warned that if the US misjudges or mishandles the cross-Straits situation, it will bring catastrophic consequences to the security, prosperity and order of the Taiwan Straits and the world at large.Global Times",CHINA,DIPLOMACY,Hua Chunying Photo: VCG,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'House of Representatives': ('ORG', 3), 'Foreign Ministry': ('ORG', 1), 'US Congress': ('ORG', 1), 'Reuters': ('ORG', 1), 'UN': ('ORG', 1), 'Hu': ('ORG', 1), 'Am': ('ORG', 1), 'Pelo': ('ORG', 1), 'People': ('ORG', 1), 'Liberation Army': ('ORG', 1), 'PLA': ('ORG', 1), 'Navy': ('ORG', 1), 'Bo': ('ORG', 1), 'Sea': ('ORG', 2), 'Fujian': ('ORG', 1), 'Nancy Pelosi': ('PER', 4), 'Hua Chunying': ('PER', 4), 'Antony Blinken': ('PER', 3), 'Taiwan': ('LOC', 6), 'China': ('LOC', 7), 'US': ('LOC', 10), 'Russia': ('LOC', 1), 'Ukraine': ('LOC', 1), 'Taiwan Straits': ('LOC', 7), 'Beijing': ('LOC', 1)}"

109,"NATO doesn't need Boris, it has enough problems already",Mark Blacklock,2022-07-31,"When I first heard that UK prime minister Boris Johnson was being touted as a possible new secretary general for NATO, I thought it was a joke, albeit a poor one. But for some of his political supporters in the UK and EU it is no joke, they are perfectly serious, and that makes it no laughing matter for both the transatlantic alliance and the rest of the world.I don't even know if he would want the job when he leaves 10 Downing Street in September. I suspect not. Becoming secretary general would preclude him from making lots of money on the post-politics lecture circuit and probably require a great deal of dedication and hard work to master the role, and everyone knows how much Boris Johnson loves the former (he is forever complaining about not having enough) and how, being famously lazy, he hates the latter.There are also enormous, if not insurmountable obstacles in the way of his taking up the position - not least that the appointment has to be the unanimous decision of all 30 NATO member states, and there are many national leaders in that group who think poorly enough of Boris Johnson to have a valid reason to veto it.Yet it is concerning because, if nothing else, it highlights a fundamental shallowness of thinking around parts of the membership, and flaws in a system of choice which is secretive, and for which there is no formal selection procedure. Instead of transparency and openness of which, as ""liberal democracies"" the member states might be expected to adhere, there is reticence and backstairs dealing around the candidate's selection to which only those involved are privy. The leadership structure or NATO itself is flawed, with a civilian head - currently former Norwegian prime minister Jens Stoltenberg - usually from EU and a supreme allied commander who has always been an US general or admiral (and whose own commander-in-chief is the US president). They sit atop a labyrinthine institution.Because of the Ukraine crisis, Stoltenberg has agreed to extend his tenure in office until September next year, after which time the nations must find a replacement.The call to install Boris Johnson in the top job came through reports in the UK media, which identified various UK Tory MPs and even Ukraine MPs as pushing for it. Ukraine does not have membership of NATO but was offered a path toward joining 14 years ago and has strong ties and a close partnership with the alliance, whose member countries are providing millions of dollars' worth of military aid to assist in its conflict with Russia. Some clearly feel they owe Boris Johnson some payback. The UK parliamentarians cited Boris Johnson's overweening support for Ukraine, with massive levels of aid and his staunch support and relatively frequent visits to his counterpart in Kiev, Volodymyr Zelenskyy (though these probably served as convenient methods of distracting from political controversies back home in the UK). It would not do a potential nomination any harm either that UK is one of only eight nations currently fulfilling or exceeding NATO's requirement for each member to spend at least 2 percent of their gross domestic product on defense. Countering these ""positive"" qualities are some major defects in the skills, temperament, experience and personality of Boris Johnson. He and his supporters admit to his having flaws, but claim these are balanced by his getting the ""big calls"" right - notably the nation's response to COVID-19, the economic ""health"" of the UK and, of course, he is credited with ""getting Brexit done."" In fact, his and his government's lamentable pandemic performance resulted in over 200,000 deaths - the highest in EU - and billions of pounds lost and wasted on contracts with, often, Tory party donors and supporters with little experience in public health crises; the UK is expected to have the slowest recovery in the G7, the highest inflation and the lowest projected growth. And far from having got Brexit done, he is threatening to ditch a key part of it, the Northern Ireland Protocol, which is considered critical to maintaining peace in that once-troubled part of the UK.This last matter highlights perhaps the greatest impediment to Boris Johnson's possible role at NATO. He is not a serious person. When he was finally forced out of office he delivered a speech to the House of Commons of breathtaking gall: He was resentful and unrepentant, blaming others for his downfall. This is the ""statesman"" whom some within the NATO family think has The Right Stuff to lead the planet's single most powerful military organization through its most complex, difficult and challenging period since its formation at the end of the World War II. How can this be the way to run an organization which controls half of the world's military might and claims to have the freedom and security of a billion citizens at its heart? NATO is deeply flawed and has enough problems already.The author is a journalist and lecturer living in UK. opinion@globaltimes.com.cn",OPINION,VIEWPOINT,Boris Johnson Photo: AFP,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'UK': ('LOC', 4), '10 Downing Street': ('LOC', 1), 'US': ('LOC', 2), 'Ukraine': ('LOC', 3), 'St': ('LOC', 1), 'Boris Johnson': ('PER', 4), 'Jens Stoltenberg': ('PER', 1), 'Tory': ('PER', 1), 'NATO': ('ORG', 4), 'EU': ('ORG', 2), 'Norwegian': ('MISC', 1)}"

Close to 300 new energy and intelligent connected vehicles are on display at the fair. Officials said China will raise the proportion of NEV sector to 20 percent of total new auto sales by 2025. Photo: cnsphotoIn the first half of 2022, China's new energy vehicles (NEV) production and sales recorded an excellent performance, with NEV cars accounting for 59 percent of the world's total NEV sales, thanks to the country's strong supply chain and market demand, Cui Dongshu, secretary general of the China Passenger Car Association (CPCA), said on Sunday.According to Cui, in the first six months of 2022, the world's NEVs maintained strong pace of growth with sales reaching 4.21 million units, up 71 percent year-on-year. Among them, 880,000 vehicles were sold in June, an increase of 46 percent year-on-year.From January to June, China sold 2.34 million NEVs, surpassing 1.09 million units in the EU market and 500,000 in North US.Due to the downturn in the NEV market in EU affected by COVID-19 pandemic and the Russia-Ukraine conflict, China's NEV sales gained weight, accounting for 59 percent of the world's NEV sales, Cui said.""That China drives the world's NEV increment in the first half of this year was mainly boosted by the strong growth of domestic NEV consumption and stable supply chain,"" Cui noted. China's NEV market growth is inspired by many positive factors including surging consumption, tax exemptions and other government policy measures. Going with the overall trend of global auto market transformation, NEVs production and sale are expected to return to normal levels, Cui said.The penetration rate of NEVs globally has continued to rise, which now stands at approximately10 percent. In China, NEV penetration has reached 22 percent while the rate for the US is only 7 percent.As EU, the US and other parts of the world increase their penetration of NEVs, the world's NEV market will enter a new phase of strong development, Cui said.Global Times",SOURCE,ECONOMY,Picture description not found,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'Haikou': ('LOC', 1), 'China': ('LOC', 8), 'Hainan Province': ('LOC', 1), 'North US': ('LOC', 3), 'Russia': ('LOC', 1), 'Ukraine': ('LOC', 1), 'NE': ('MISC', 1), 'COVID - 19': ('MISC', 1), 'Cui Dongshu': ('PER', 4), 'China Passenger Car Association': ('ORG', 1), 'CPCA': ('ORG', 1), 'EU': ('ORG', 3)}"

And, booming trade is expected to help alleviate Mongolia's economic difficulties.Zhuengadabuqi Port in Dong Ujimchin Banner, bordering Mongolia, has formally resumed customs services, after it was shut down on September 15, 2021 due to the latest wave of coronavirus outbreaks along the China-Mongolia border, a staff member from Dongwu Customs, which is in charge of the port, told the Global Times on Sunday.""In order for the port capacity to recover as soon as possible, the port opened a 'green passage' on July 25 that allows the passage of people and cargo from both sides, including vehicles and machines,"" said the staff member. By Saturday, a total of 108 vehicles and 350.6 tons of goods had been exported to Mongolia via the port, according to the staff member.To prevent cross-border transmission of COVID-19, local authorities have set up specific areas for containers of coal and crude oil, while efforts have also been made to put the port under closed-loop management, the staff member said.The reopening of ports linking China and Mongolia will boost the exchanges of major commodities including coal, crude oil and machinery, Sun Huijun, an expert on relations between China, Mongolia and Central Asia countries, told the Global Times on Sunday.According to industry newspaper China Metallurgical News, Mongolia's coal exports surged 225.8 percent on a yearly basis to reach 2.36 million tons in June, the highest since February 2021. The country's coal exports to China jumped 224.2 percent year-on-year in the month to hit 2.1 million tons, it said.Generally, major goods imported from Mongolia to China via Zhuengadabuqi Port are crude oil, coal and iron ore. In 2021, more than 145,000 tons of crude oil, 379,700 tons of coking coal and 1,270 tons of iron ore were imported through Zhuengadabuqi Port, according to customs data.""With an international energy crisis amid the Russia-Ukraine conflict, increasing coal and oil imports from Mongolia will help increase strategic reserve of leading industrial materials for China,"" Sun said, noting that ""ensuring smooth trade between the two countries will effectively reduce Mongolia's heavy economic pressure caused by the pandemic.""A report released by the World Bank in April projected that Mongolia's economy could grow by 2.5 percent in 2022, saying that its economic growth is being dragged down by protracted trade disruptions and logistical bottlenecks  due to border closures.In a sign of rapidly recovering trade, Xuzhou in China's Jiangsu Province has launched a new freight train service to Mongolia, the Xinhua News Agency reported. Carrying about 440 tons of goods valued at $1.4 million, including motorbikes, aluminum empty cans and security doors, the train is expected to arrive in Ulan Bator on August 1, it said.On July 20, a batch of aid commodities including steel plates, street lights and electric gates were transported through Uligi port in Inner Mongolia to Mongolia, marking the first temporary opening of the port this year, said a statement on the Hohhot customs website.Due to the impact of COVID-19 pandemic, Uligi Port was ordered to open only from the 15th to 25th of each month from March to December, and was first opened in 2022 on July 20, a staff member from Alxa customs, which is in charge of Uligi Port, told the Global Times on Sunday. A total of 26.3 tons of cargo valued for 862,000 yuan was exported through the Uligi Port to the Mongolia on the first port-opening day, said the staff member.""Mongolia on the other side of Uligi Port has abundant mineral reserve, including the world's largest coking coal mine,"" said the staff member, while noting that bilateral mineral trade has not started yet via the port.The China and Mongolian economies are complementary and have great cooperation potential, with China owning a large market, advanced technologies and sufficient capital, while Mongolia is home to rich mineral resources.The two countries have maintained close economic relations. China has been Mongolia's biggest trading partner and the top source of foreign investment for 18 consecutive years. According to data from China Ministry of Commerce, the bilateral trade volume hit $9.12 billion in 2021, up 35.3 percent year-on-year.By giving play to China's advantage in infrastructure, the two countries should strengthen cooperation in this regard to realize infrastructure connections as soon as possible, Sun said, suggesting the two sides step up cooperation in emerging sectors including logistics, cross-border tourism and finance as well.He said the booming economic cooperation between China and Mongolia will contribute to the development of the Belt and Road Initiative in the post-COVID-19 era and inject impetus into the recovery of global industrial and supply chains.",SOURCE,ECONOMY,(Photo: Xinhua),Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'North China': ('LOC', 7), 'Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region': ('LOC', 12), 'Zhuengadabuqi Port': ('LOC', 1), 'Dong Ujimchin Banner': ('LOC', 1), 'Central Asia': ('LOC', 1), 'Russia': ('LOC', 1), 'Ukraine': ('LOC', 1), 'COVID - 19': ('MISC', 2), 'Dongwu Customs': ('ORG', 1), 'Global Times': ('ORG', 2), 'China Metallurgical News': ('ORG', 1), 'Sun Huijun': ('PER', 1)}"
112,"China, Central Asian countries enhance strategic partnership, boost connectivity, economic ties",Chen Qingqing,2022-07-31," Following the consensus reached at the latest Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) foreign ministers' meeting in Tashkent, China and Central Asia countries - Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan have agreed to enhance their strategic partnerships and build an even closer China-Central Asia community with a shared future, particularly focusing on enhancing connectivity and boosting trade and economic cooperation. Amid the Russia-Ukraine crisis and growing uncertainties in the international landscape, Central Asia countries have been facing more security challenges and economic pressures. As landlocked countries, they usually encounter bottlenecks in development given the limited capacity in logistics and transport, and these problems have been amplified under the current crisis, China experts said. With China and some Central Asia countries reaching a new consensus in enhancing strategic partnerships and boosting economic cooperation, the development of a landmark China-Kyrgyzstan-Uzbekistan rail project reflects that the consensus between big and smaller countries within the SCO has been gradually shaped, some experts said. While the SCO used to focus more on security cooperation in the past, it will accelerate regional economic cooperation such as in infrastructure and energy in the future, they noted. During a meeting between Kyrgyz President Sadyr Zhaparov and visiting China State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi in Kyrgyzstan on Saturday, Zhaparov said Kyrgyzstan always cherishes the friendship between Kyrgyzstan and China, and sincerely appreciates China's firm support and valuable assistance to Kyrgyzstan in safeguarding sovereignty and security, accelerating economic development and improving people's livelihoods, according to the China Foreign Ministry's website on Sunday. This year marks the 30th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic ties between China and Kyrgyzstan.The Kyrgyz side regards the China-Kyrgyzstan-Uzbekistan railway as an important link in building the Belt and Road, the president noted, saying that his country thanks China for sending experts to do field studies and is eager to advance this state-level cooperation project in an accelerated manner.The conditions for the construction of the China-Kyrgyzstan-Uzbekistan railway are getting ripe, Wang said. The first batch of China experts arrived in Kyrgyzstan recently for site surveys, and the construction process has kicked off, he said, noting that China is ready to work with Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan to speed up feasibility studies.China and Uzbekistan also pledged to speed up the feasibility study for the China-Kyrgyzstan-Uzbekistan railway, improve the capacity of the railway and the China-Kyrgyzstan-Uzbekistan highway, and strengthen cooperation on road-rail combined transport along the China-Kyrgyzstan-Uzbekistan route, according to a meeting between Wang and Uzbekistan's Acting Foreign Minister Vladimir Norov on Thursday. A major suggestion from the latest SCO foreign ministers is to seek joint development. Under the West sanctions against Russia, Central Asia countries are facing growing pressure on their economic development, Zhang Hong, an EU studies expert from the China Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times on Sunday. ""While the China-Kyrgyzstan-Uzbekistan railway symbolizes more opportunities, as its long-term planning has become ripe, it also showed that big and smaller countries within the SCO are gradually reaching a consensus, although it was not easy to do,"" he said. The planning for the China-Kyrgyzstan-Uzbekistan railway dates back to 1997, and this long-awaited transnational project is expected to complete the southern passage of the New Eurasian Land Bridge, shaping a convenient transportation path from East and Southeast Asia to Central and West Asia, Northern Africa and EU, according to previous reports.Advancing regional cooperation is also in line with the China's proposals made at the SCO foreign ministers' meeting on Friday, including that SCO countries should adhere to a people-centered development philosophy, carry out more sustainable cooperation projects that benefit people's livelihoods, and deepen high-quality Belt and Road cooperation.The current geopolitical and economic situations such as the Russia-Ukraine crisis and the Afghanistan issue are adding political uncertainties to the Central Asia region, and those countries hope to increase international cooperation, particularly balancing and diversifying diplomacy to work with countries like Russia, China and India to stabilize the regional situation, Zhu Yongbiao, director of the Center for Afghanistan Studies at Lanzhou University, told the Global Times on Sunday. ""Wang's visit will help enhance regional security and development, which will also boost multilateral mechanisms such as the C+C5 format and the SCO,"" Zhu said, noting that enhancing connectivity and advancing more Belt and Road projects will be the major focuses in China's cooperation with those countries. In terms of the cooperation between China and Central Asia countries, China has been emphasizing the multilateralism and cooperation between countries to bring mutual benefits, and the current cooperation underscores this, which will not only boost China-Central Asia cooperation but also cooperation within the SCO, experts said. ""SCO cooperation has been focused on security cooperation in the past. In the future, there will be more possibilities of expanding trade and economic ties among SCO members on the basis of safeguarding regional security,"" Zhang said, noting that more cooperation in infrastructure and energy are in consideration.",CHINA,DIPLOMACY,"Kyrgyz President Sadyr Zhaparov (right) meets with visiting Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi in Kyrgyzstan on July 30, 2022.

115,"Xi criticizes US rivalry policy in candid talk with Biden, warns over Taiwan question but both sides emphasize cooperation",Yang Sheng,2022-07-28,"China President Xi Jinping and US President Joe Biden spoke via telephone for over two hours on Thursday at a juncture of increased tension between China and the US due to the security situation around the Taiwan Straits and US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's reported plan to visit the island of Taiwan. During the conversation with Xi Jinping, Joe Biden reiterated that the one-China policy of the US has not changed and will not change, and that the US does not support ""Taiwan independence.""Experts said the Xi Jinping-Joe Biden talk is significant for the two great powers to manage their differences amid the serious tension, while it also sends a positive signal to the world that the two countries are still willing to cooperate with each other. On the evening of July 28, Xi Jinping spoke with Joe Biden on the phone at the request of the latter. The two presidents had a candid communication and exchange on China-US relations and issues of mutual interest, the Xinhua News Agency reported late Thursday evening.Analysts said that according to the official information released about the Xi Jinping-Joe Biden conversation, it is impressive that the China leader is being very candid to directly criticize US policy on China, including its strategy that sees China as a ""primary rival"" and the US actions to push decoupling with China, and he also reaffirmed China's bottom line on Taiwan question. Xi Jinping warned Joe Biden ""those who play with fire will perish by it."" China experts said that the US politicians who intended to ""play with fire"" on the Taiwan question will sense great pressure after the conversation. ""The phone call shows China has always refused to define China-US relations as competitor as it will only lead to more tragedies. It is clear that the US view of China-US relations as competitor has led to evident misjudgments,"" a Beijing-based expert on foreign affairs told the Global Times on condition of anonymity. It should be noted that cooperation is still at the core of the talk. China and the US can and should cooperate in many fields, the above-quoted expert said. Against the backdrop of the complex and volatile international situation, China and the US should move their relations along the track of cooperation in a way that meets the common expectations and national interests of all countries, instead of positioning China as a strategic competitor and pushing China-US relations to a tragic path where competition is the bottom line, the expert said.China experts noted that the issue of tariffs was not mentioned in the China press release although it was mentioned many times by the US media as a possible bargaining chip. The global economic situation and the international landscape are more important than the issue of tariffs. It reflects that China and the US could cooperate in a stable and anticipated direction and some US Congress members and media are being too shallow in how they interpret US-China relations. They fail to grasp the importance of the relations to the region and even the world.Wills of cooperation Xi Jinping pointed out that in the world today, the trends of turbulence and transformation are evolving, and deficits in development and security are looming large. Faced with a world of change and disorder, the international community and people around the world expect China and the US to take the lead in upholding world peace and security and in promoting global development and prosperity. This is the responsibility of China and the US as two major countries.Joe Biden said that the world is at a critical moment. US-China cooperation benefits not only the two peoples but also people of all countries. The US hopes to keep an open line of communication with China to enhance mutual understanding and avoid misperception and miscalculation, and will work with China where the interests of the two countries align and, at the same time, properly manage differences.Jin Canrong, associate dean of the School of International Studies at the Renmin University of China, told the Global Times on Thursday that due to Pelosi's reported plan to visit Taiwan and the Chips and Science Act passed by the US Senate, China-US ties are getting more and more intense, but even under this situation, the two leaders can still have a conversation, so this is at least good for the two countries to stabilize and manage the tension. The US economy shrank in the spring for the second consecutive quarter, meeting the criteria for a so-called technical recession as raging inflation and higher interest rates forced consumers and businesses to pull back on spending, Fox Business reported on Thursday.Lü Xiang, an expert on US studies at the China Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times on Thursday that when recession and inflation come at the same time, US policy to handle economic problems will become a ""double-edged sword"" as it would be really hard for the US to find a perfect solution that can effectively deal with the two problems.Under such a difficult situation, the US needs to settle relations with other major powers, to create a better external environment for it to focus on fixing its own economic problems, but due to the toxic political atmosphere in the US, officials and politicians in US seems to prefer to secure their own positions by worsening ties with other major powers, Lü said.""The economic pressure is a key reason why Joe Biden desperately needs to talk with China leader, and since the US side also expressed the will to cooperate and keep communication, we have confidence in the two sides keeping open frequent exchanges between senior officials,"" Jin said.In fields like the urgent food crisis, and ones that US is willing to cooperate on like climate change and COVID-19 pandemic, ""we might be able to see some positive signs after the Xi Jinping-Joe Biden talk, and the Joe Biden administration might adjust tariffs due to inflation pressure,"" Jin noted. The two presidents exchanged views on issues including the Ukraine crisis. Xi Jinping reiterated China's principled position.Both presidents viewed their call as candid and in-depth. They agreed to stay in touch and instructed the two teams to keep up communication and cooperation, Xinhua reported.Taiwan questionThe China president once again warned the US side about the seriousness and significance of the Taiwan question. Xi Jinping told Joe Biden that the Taiwan question is crystal clear, and so are the facts and status quo that both sides of the Taiwan Straits belong to one and the same China. The three China-US joint communiqués embody the political commitments made by the two sides, and the one-China principle is the political foundation for China-US relations.China firmly opposes separatist moves toward ""Taiwan independence"" and interference by external forces, and never allows any room for ""Taiwan independence"" forces in whatever form. The position of the China government and people on the Taiwan question is consistent, and resolutely safeguarding China's national sovereignty and territorial integrity is the firm will of the more than 1.4 billion China people, Xi Jinping noted. ""Public opinion cannot be defied. Those who play with fire will perish by it. It is hoped that the US will be clear-eyed about this,"" Xi Jinping said.Jin said this is a clear and strong warning signal, adding to the warnings already sent out by the China Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of National Defense, so it is certain that if Pelosi insists on her provocative plan of visiting Taiwan, she will face serious and unbearable consequences.  Yang Xiyu, senior research fellow at the China Institute of International Studies, told the Global Times on Thursday that after the Xi Jinping-Joe Biden telephone talk, attention should be focused on whether Pelosi would still go to the island of Taiwan.  ""If Pelosi abandons her plan to visit Taiwan, then it would be a critical achievement of the talk between the two presidents, and this will set a stabilizer for China-US ties that releases a strong and positive signal to the world. But if she insists on going ahead with the plan, it would bring huge damage to China-US relations, and it will bring great uncertainty to the global political and economic situations,"" Yang said.Joe Biden and Pelosi are split over the speaker's potential trip to the island, as Pelosi is considering the midterm elections and her own political interests, while Joe Biden must consider it from the perspective of the White House and be responsible for US national interests, analysts noted. But experts also warned that China should not pin too much hope on the US side to restrict Pelosi's behavior, as the US has proved many times that it cannot keep its words, even when they have openly made promises to China time and again, so being prepared for the worst scenario, especially military preparation, is the best way for China to prevent or deter the situation from worsening.",CHINA,DIPLOMACY,Photo:Xinhua,"Reporter, Beijing","Yang Sheng is a chief reporter at the Global Times covering Chinese politics, diplomacy and military.","{'China': ('LOC', 17), 'US': ('LOC', 14), 'Taiwan Straits': ('LOC', 5), 'Beijing': ('LOC', 1), 'Xi Jinping': ('PER', 6), 'Joe Biden': ('PER', 6), 'Nancy Pelosi': ('PER', 1), 'US House': ('ORG', 1), 'Xinhua News Agency': ('ORG', 1), 'one': ('MISC', 1)}"
116,CPC leadership meeting urges to strive for 'best result' for economy,Chu Daye,2022-07-28,"On Thursday, top China officials held a closely watched meeting that analyzed the current economic situation and set the tone for economic work in the second half of 2022, emphasizing efforts to keep the China economy operating in ""reasonable range"" and to strive for the ""best result"" while also stressing sticking to the country's dynamic zero-COVID-19 strategy.The meeting, which also covered fiscal and monetary policies and other economic stabilization measures, highlighted top China leadership's confidence in not only keeping COVID-19 under effective control, but also keeping the world's second-largest economy stable, despite lingering challenges, analysts said. They noted that implementation of supportive measures could accelerate and boost growth in the second half of the year.  Xi Jinping, general secretary of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee, presided over the meeting of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee to analyze current economic situation and arrange economic work for the second half of this year, according to the Xinhua News Agency.China has effectively coordinated COVID-19 prevention and control with economic and social development, with positive results seen and new achievements made on the two fronts. But the meeting also noted ""some prominent challenges,"" calling for maintaining strategic focus and running China's own affairs well.China's GDP expanded 2.5 percent year-on-year in the first half of 2022.The growth was achieved after the country's GDP grew 0.4 percent year-on-year in the second quarter amid COVID-19 outbreaks in major economies powerhouses, including Shanghai.For the second half of 2022, the meeting urged efforts to consolidate the upward trend of economic recovery, keep employment and prices stable, keep the economy running within an appropriate range, and strive for the best possible outcome.Efforts are needed to efficiently coordinate COVID-19 prevention and control with economic and social development, the meeting said.The orderly operations of major functions that affect China's economic and social development should be ensured, the meeting noted. Analysts maintain that the meeting showed the top China leadership's confidence in keeping the virus at bay while keeping the economy humming, as it has deployed a multipronged approach in both stabilizing the supply and the demand sides primarily through the existing fiscal and monetary supportive measures.China has largely dealt with the sudden impact of the Russia-Ukraine conflict and epidemic outbreaks that seriously affected economic powerhouses including Shanghai in earlier summer. The economy is now on a recovering trend, and now it is time to meticulously implement fiscal and monetary support policies in the second half, analysts said.Now China has found a balance between economic development and containment of the epidemic, Tian Yun, a Beijing-based veteran macroeconomic analyst, told the Global Times on Thursday.The recovery of the entire economy is relatively obvious after the country has ensured normal nucleic acid testing, timely detection and quarantine, especially home isolation, said Tian.""The top CPC leadership meeting has made it clear that China will expand domestic demand, which will be the focus of policymaking for the second half of the year. Greater efforts should be made in new infrastructure,"" Tian noted.China's exports performed strongly in the first half of 2022, with a 13.2 percent year-on-year increase. Consumption and investment were less satisfactory.Since July, the prices of bulk commodities and raw materials have dropped significantly, and this has laid a good foundation for China to accelerate infrastructure construction in the third and fourth quarters, Tian noted.The main problem of economic growth still comes from the weak demand, so the meeting has issued a variety of arrangements on how to promote the demand, Hu Qimu, chief research fellow at the Sinosteel Economic Research Institute, told the Global Times on Thursday.""The China economy is already bouncing back, so we must persevere the current growth trend, which will lead to a relatively good economic growth for the whole year,"" said Hu.Lian Ping, head of Zhixin Investment Research Institute, told the Global Times on Thursday that all the supportive policies designated to shore up growth in 2022 have been rolled out by now, and this is a big sum at an estimated 7 trillion yuan ($1.04 trillion), including special-purpose bonds, profit handed over by the central bank and policy bank loans.""In the second half, it will be about how these funds are effectively implemented on the ground and how these funds could leverage more financial resources from the market to give the economy a shot in the arm,"" Lian said, noting that any further supportive polices rolled out in the second half will actually be meant for 2023.

Photo: cnsphotoHouses and jobsIn July, the economy is confronted with crisis at several rural banks in some localities and default mortgage risks, unfinished housing projects in many cities also reflected the woes in the property sector.For the first time, the CPC leadership meeting included ""ensuring housing delivery"" in a politburo document, Yan Yuejin, research director at Shanghai-based E-house China R&D Institute, told the Global Times on Thursday.The words ""stabilize real estate industry"" ranked before ""houses are for living, not for speculation,"" which fully shows the occurrence of unstable factors in current real estate market, including loan disturbances and the debt risk of real estate enterprises, said Yan.""The real estate sector is currently the biggest drag on economic growth and must be resolved in the third and fourth quarters so that it will be on a normal growth path,"" Tian noted, adding that it is not normal to see four consecutive quarters of negative growth in the housing sector - from the third quarter of 2021 to the second quarter of 2022.Besides the property sector, right now the most important thing in the second half of the year is to ensure employment to stabilize the overall economy, Wang Dan, chief economist of Hang Seng Bank China, told the Global Times on Thursday.The normalization of regulation on platform economy, another signal from the top leadership meeting, will hopefully keep platform companies growing and provide more jobs, Wang said.Analysts say that despite the new challenges of the second quarter, China will still be the world's fastest-growing economy, and with the meeting highlighting the support for the industrial chains, the main policy for the rest of the year will be aimed at addressing the liquidity difficulties of enterprises, and at strengthening the resilience and competitiveness of the China industry chain.In its latest forecast this week, describing the world's economic outlook as ""gloomy and more uncertain,"" the IMF projects China, the world's second-largest economy, to grow 3.3 percent in 2022, compared with 2.3 percent for the US and 2.6 percent for the eurozone.",SOURCE,ECONOMY,"People tour a local market at the Qingyun Road in Nanming District of Guiyang, capital city of southwest China's Guizhou Province, July 21, 2022.

117,Industry leaders urge more R&D to boost agricultural seed security,GT staff reporters,2022-07-29,"Soybean seeds undergoing genetic modification experiments in a lab at Longping Biotechnology (Hainan) Co in Sanya, China's Hainan Province. File Photo: Zhao Juecheng/GTChinese agricultural scientists and industry leaders at a major forum on seeds in China's Hainan Province on Thursday called for more efforts to boost research and development (R&D) in crop seeds to ensure food security.The 2022 China Seed Congress and the Nanfan Agricultural Silicon Valley Forum kicked off in Sanya, Hainan, bringing together more than 2,000 scientists, field workers and company representatives to discuss the challenges facing China's seed industry and solutions amid global food price hikes.The forum will be problem-oriented, focusing on the protection and utilization of crop germplasm resources, seed industry technology innovation, seed industry intellectual property protection and other topics. China's seed breeding breakthrough is one of the focal points of the forum.The conflict between Russia and Ukraine, COVID-19 and extreme weather have made the domestic industry more aware of the crisis of seeds, Wang Feng, principal scientist at the Rice Research Institute of the Guangdong Academy of Agricultural Sciences, told the Global Times.""Even if there are no developed countries strangling China seeds, we can still feel that the external environment is forcing US to take the rice bowl in our own hands,"" said Wang.Wang noted that COVID-19 pandemic, Russia-Ukraine conflict and other factors have made global logistics intermittent. The lack of timely access to international markets and extreme weather conditions in EU and the US are affecting local food production and have raised concerns about food security in various countries.""China imports soybeans and corn every year. To eliminate food security risks, it is necessary to increase scientific and technological investment in China's seed industry,"" Wang said, adding that seed companies and scientific research institutions should do well in R&D to make the limited land more productive.""In a word, 'good for farmers and good for consumers' is the direction of our seed selection,"" Zhang Qin, Vice Chairman and General Manager of Anhui Quanyin Seed Industry Technology Co Ltd, told the Global Times.Zhang said that 90 percent of the seeds sold by Quanyin came from the company's own R&D, and it spent 5 percent of its annual sales revenue on R&D, about 80 to 100 million yuan ($11.9-14.8 million).Data from the company show that in 2021, Quanyin sold more than 100 million kilograms of seeds for various crops, which can produce 60 billion kilograms of grain, sufficient to feed 100 million people.A staffer from Yuan Long Ping High-Tech Agriculture Co Ltd (Longping High-tech), a leading domestic seed company, told the Global Times that although domestic seed companies have increased their R&D investment in recent years, China's national seed industry is still small in size, low in concentration and low in R&D investment.In 2020, the sales revenue of Longping High-tech was 3.3 billion yuan ($420 million), accounting for 5 percent of the domestic seed market with R&D investment of 346 million yuan ($44 million). Meanwhile, the revenue of Bayer, Germen seed company, was 62.1 billion yuan ($7.9 billion), accounting for more than 20 percent of the global seed market. Bayer's R&D investment in agricultural business reached 18.08 billion yuan ($2.3 billion), said the staffer.""China's seed industry is completely different from international seed giants in terms of business scale and R&D investment,"" the staffer noted.As R&D is crucial to the seed industry, China seed companies, in addition to the domestic market, have been actively expanding their R&D layout in overseas markets in recent years.For instance, Longping High-tech has built more than 50 breeding stations for rice, corn, vegetables, millet and sunflower in China, Brazil, the US, Pakistan, the Philippines and other countries, with a total area of 13,000 mu (866.7 hectares) of test bases.Jiang Sanqiao, deputy general manager of Quanyin, told the Global Times that the company's seeds are now exported to more than 20 countries and regions.Since 2011, Quanyin has undertaken national agricultural technology cooperation projects in Angola, Sierra Leone, Tanzania and other countries, and cultivated and built more than 100,000 mu (6,666.7 hectares) of rice and corn farms overseas, according to Jiang.""The pandemic has also raised awareness on food security in countries in Southeast Asia and Africa,"" Jiang said, citing Bangladesh as an example, which has solved its own food problem after China's high-yield hybrid rice was introduced in recent years.The same is true in the Philippines. After COVID-19, the planting area of China hybrid rice has gradually increased in the Philippines. ""In recent years, our company's seed exports to the Philippines have been growing at an annual rate of 50 percent,"" said Jiang.",SOURCE,ECONOMY,Picture description not found,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'##be': ('ORG', 1), 'Longping Biotechnology': ('ORG', 1), 'Hainan ) Co': ('ORG', 1), 'Zhao Juecheng': ('ORG', 1), 'GTChinese': ('ORG', 1), 'Seed Congress': ('ORG', 1), 'Nanfan Agricultural Silicon Valley Forum': ('ORG', 1), 'Rice Research Institute': ('ORG', 1), 'Guangdong Academy of Agricultural Sciences': ('ORG', 1), 'Global Times': ('ORG', 2), 'R & D': ('ORG', 2), 'Zhang Qin': ('ORG', 1), 'Anhui': ('ORG', 1), 'Co Ltd': ('ORG', 1), 'Zhangn': ('ORG', 1), 'R &': ('ORG', 1), 'Sanya': ('LOC', 2), 'China': ('LOC', 7), 'Hainan Province': ('LOC', 3), 'Russia': ('LOC', 2), 'Ukraine': ('LOC', 2), 'US': ('LOC', 2), 'EU': ('LOC', 1), '2022 China': ('MISC', 1), 'COVID': ('MISC', 2), '19': ('MISC', 2), 'Wang Feng': ('PER', 4)}"

An employee arranges meat at a supermarket in Ankara, Türkiye, on July 28, 2022.(Photo: Xinhua) Soaring inflation and declining purchasing power have forced Turkey households to cut their red meat consumption by nearly half in the past few years.A family of four in Türkiye has reduced its annual consumption of red meat to 28 kg, from 56 kg in 2017, according to figures from Türkiye's Red Meat Industry and Producers Association (ETBIR).The big drop in meat consumption came when COVID-19 pandemic took hold in the country more than two years ago, Ahmet Yucesan, chairman of ETBIR, told Xinhua.The first drop was due to restricted access to shops and restaurants, and then ""the rising prices and declining purchasing power started to affect consumption,"" said Yucesan.Demand for red meat has dropped by 35 percent in the first six months of 2022, while production costs surged by more than 150 percent, leading to a 110-percent rise in red meat prices, he added.In Istanbul, the largest Turkey city of more than 16 million, about 45 percent of respondents said they could no longer afford red meat, according to a recent survey by the city's municipal authorities.Türkiye's inflation soared to 78.6 percent in June, hitting a two-decade high, amid a global food and fuel crisis in the fallout of the Russia-Ukraine conflict and COVID-19 pandemic.At the exit of a supermarket chain in a residential neighborhood in the capital Ankara, a shopper told Xinhua that it is impossible not to be affected by the rising prices of basic goods, particularly meat.""I can't give a precise figure on how much less we are buying now compared to previous years but it's a considerable drop,"" said Zeynep Taskin, a teacher in a private school.The government's move to raise the minimum monthly wage to 5,500 liras (307 U.S. dollars) over the past six months has provided some relief for about 10 million low-paid workers in the country, but still fails to keep pace with the annual inflation galloping toward three-digit percentage.Taskin, a mother of two who earns just above the minimum wage, has been on the lookout for meat with special discounts offered by different markets.""We are thinking twice before buying meat,"" she noted.Yucesan expects a continuous increase in meat prices in the coming months as producers are inclined to adjust their prices in September and October, calling for more government incentives to cattle and sheep farmers.",PHOTO,WORLD,"Meat sellers wait for customers at a supermarket in Ankara, Türkiye, on July 28, 2022.(Photo: Xinhua)",Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'Ankara': ('LOC', 3), 'Turkey': ('LOC', 2), 'Istanbul': ('LOC', 1), 'Russia': ('LOC', 1), 'Ukraine': ('LOC', 1), 'Türkiye': ('ORG', 5), 'Xinhua': ('ORG', 4), 'Red Meat Industry and Producers Association': ('ORG', 1), 'ETBIR': ('ORG', 2), 'COVID - 19': ('MISC', 2), 'Ahmet Yucesan': ('PER', 2)}"
119,"Istanbul's ""public bread"" factories boost production to meet rising demand for affordable food",Xinhua,2022-07-29,"At a big bread factory in Istanbul, the production line was running at full steam as the machines kneaded the dough in huge pots, shaped it on the conveyer belt, and baked pieces of bread in the ovens.""There is a huge increase in demand for public bread right now due to the soaring bread prices in the city,"" Harun Celebi, a shift supervisor at the Istanbul Halk Ekmek (IHE) Cebeci plant in the Sultangazi district, told Xinhua while checking the baking degree of pieces of bread in a giant oven.IHE, or Istanbul Public Bread, a subsidiary of Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality, has been producing regular bread and baked products at affordable prices for the public since its foundation in 1978.The institution has recently taken a series of measures to meet the increasing demand of Istanbulites for affordable bread, increased the efficiency of the lines of its three factories, and inaugurated a new plant to better cope with the growing demands.IHE has managed to increase its daily production capacity from 1.5 to 1.8 million of regular bread. With more than 3,000 sales points, the institution currently meets 12 percent of Istanbul's bread needs.At the beginning of July, the price of 210 grams of normal bread produced by private bakeries in Istanbul rose from 3 liras to 4 liras (0.22 U.S. dollars), marking the third hike since November 2021. IHE currently sells 250 grams of bread for 2 liras. The price of a normal IHE bread was 1.25 liras in February.Okan Gedik, head of IHE, told Xinhua in a recent written interview that due to the recent hikes in bread prices in the city of over 16 million people, the demand for public bread has increased significantly.""As a result of rising energy expenses, commodity prices, labor cost, and exchange rate effects, we are faced with a serious cost increase in every field in our country,"" he said.""The geopolitical risks in the region, which is very important for world grain production, has made the situation even riskier,"" said Gedik, referring to the grain export from Ukraine amid the ongoing crisis.""In particular, agricultural input costs showed an increasing course above all times,"" he pointed out.To prevent these price hikes, IHE has been trying to make long-term, cost-fixing contracts with its suppliers as much as possible, according to Gedik.""Additionally, we launched a direct purchasing program from our farmers to encourage wheat farming in the province of Istanbul,"" he remarked.His institution also focused on internal processes and efficiency studies to create savings opportunities.Türkiye is facing a 78.62 percent annual inflation in June, which has put a massive burden on people. The Turkey currency lira lost 45 percent of its value against the U.S. dollar in 2021 and another 25 percent this year.Bread has become the most important food item for the low-income group in the country. People frequently stage long queues to buy bread at affordable prices in front of IHE kiosks.

120,Gas cut deal hardly hides divide within EU,Xia Wenxin,2022-07-27,"On Tuesday, the EU (EU) reached a political agreement on a voluntary reduction of natural gas demand this winter by 15 percent compared to their average consumption in the past five years. However, US media Politico reported that the gas savings target, in the end, might be closer to 10 percent, partly because of ""a smorgasbord of carve-outs and exemptions.""Apparently, the EU's gas saving targets fall ""unequally"" across the member states. According to the deal, some countries will have their target reduced to 7 percent or less, while some can be completely exempted altogether from the gas cut obligation.It is certain that reducing dependence on natural gas remains one of the EU's general goals, and there are two layers behind such an ambition. First, EU seeks to reduce its use of natural gas, because the current energy shortage across the EU continent is forcing it to do so. Second, the EU is mainly focused on reducing natural gas imports from Russia due to worries about Moscow's countersanctions that may completely halt gas deliveries.EU is now indeed facing a thorny dilemma. ""Saving gas for a safe winter"" has already become the EU's strategic goal. But the gas cut will, for sure, have a significant impact on EU society, including people's livelihoods, as well as production, and the overall economic recovery.It does not rule out the possibility that Brussels and Moscow are willing to give each other a step down. For example, in the face of the EU people's complaints about the energy crisis, a de-escalation of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, and a colder winter, the EU may loosen its sanctions on Russia and temporarily cease cutting gas. And Russia may be willing to provide more gas in such a scenario. However, the current stalemate between the EU and Russia is a knot that is not so easy to untangle in the short term. And it may even become a deadlock in the end.Germany Vice Chancellor Robert Habeck said the Tuesday agreement shows EU solidarity and unity, but this looks more like a compromise than a sign of unity, as the disparity of the gas savings target figure of EU countries embodies the differences in economic development and energy structure between large and small countries within the union.It also shows that in the face of the crisis, EU's political solidarity on the surface - or the uniformity of decision-making and actions - is only empty talk. There are 27 member states in the EU, and obviously, they are not a monolithic bloc. For instance, some are heavily dependent on Moscow's gas in terms of Russia energy imports.Thus, despite an agreement, EU member states will unlikely fully comply with their commitments to the deal. Instead, they will act according to their own needs to maximize their interests.The divergences among EU countries shown in this deal will affect the union's consistency when dealing with the wider energy crisis. It will also affect the realization of the continent's green transition, an ambitious blueprint advanced by the EU Commission. For the moment, EU is trapped with puzzles both at home and abroad. COVID-19 pandemic strikes the continent repeatedly; capitalism faces a systematic economic crisis; and the external geopolitical turmoil of the Russia-Ukraine conflict spills over to the energy sector. All these crises combined are making EU look more chaotic than ever. If the EU continues to require individual countries to implement the reduction of gas demand in accordance with the EU's goals through the so-called coordination mechanism, then the EU is bound to be seriously divided.Today's EU politicians only care about their political position instead of worrying about people's livelihoods. They only seek short-term interests and lack long-term strategic vision. Worse, they lack political experience. As a result, these politicians can hardly handle the complicated governance of EU, leaving the whole continent without a sense of direction.The US is the most willing to see the EU hurt itself because of sanctions against Russia, hoping to divide and weaken EU further. Completely kidnapped by the US, the EU has even less consideration for any independent diplomacy and defense.  The author is a reporter with the Global Times. opinion@globaltimes.com.cn",OPINION,VIEWPOINT,EU Unity Illustration: Chen Xia/GT,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'EU': ('ORG', 16), 'Politico': ('ORG', 1), 'US': ('LOC', 1), 'Russia': ('LOC', 5), 'Moscow': ('LOC', 2), 'Brussels': ('LOC', 1), 'Ukraine': ('LOC', 1), 'Germany': ('LOC', 1), 'Robert': ('PER', 1)}"
121,Japanese delegation's visit to Taiwan bodes ill for island: experts,Fan Anqi and Wan Hengyi,2022-07-28,"A parliamentary delegation led by former Japan defense ministers arrived in China's Taiwan island on Wednesday to discuss ""security concerns"" across the Taiwan Straits. The move is seen by experts as a pretext to hype conflict, with the true intention of expanding Japan's military power.Former Japan defense ministers Shigeru Ishiba and Yasukazu Hamada led a parliamentary delegation of four from Japan's National Diet to China's Taiwan, and arrived at Songshan Airport in Taipei on Wednesday morning. During the trip, they are scheduled to hold talks with Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) authorities, local media reported.The purpose of the visit is to ""discuss extensively the regional security situation in Taiwan, especially in the context of the Russia-Ukraine military conflict,"" local media reported. The Japan lawmakers will meet with regional leader Tsai Ing-wen and deputy regional leader Lai Tsing-te, among other officials, local media said.The visit was announced on July 12 after Lai attended late Japan prime minister Shinzo Abe's funeral in a ""private capacity."" Officials with the island's ""external affairs department"" noted that it was particularly meaningful for Japan Diet members to visit the island after Abe's passing, which means that support for Taiwan ""will not dissipate.""Abe's passing was felt most keenly by the secessionist Taiwan authorities, Liu Jiangyong, vice dean of the Institute of Modern International Relations at Tsinghua University, told the Global Times on Wednesday, noting that Abe and his brother Nobuo Kishi, Japan's current minister of defense, long played crucial roles in collusion between the island and Japan.After Abe's death, the DPP authority urgently needs a new candidate to fill this position and build new channels with Tokyo, and Kishi is believed to be the best option. With Kishi holding a key position in the Japan cabinet, the two former defense ministers' visit to the island became important pawns to convey voices for both sides, Liu said. In its annual defense white paper published last week, Japan had significantly wider coverage of the Taiwan question from the previous year.. The white paper, for the first time, included a hypothetical ""invasion"" of Taiwan by the China mainland, Asia News reported earlier. ""If an emergency were to occur in Taiwan… the crisis would also inevitably affect Japan, which is why it is said, 'An emergency for Taiwan is also an emergency for Japan',"" the report said.""Japan has long been obsessed with its colonial rule in the island of Taiwan. What's more, the Taiwan question involves the Diaoyu Islands disputes,"" Liu said. ""Japan is not merely following the US on the issue, but also has its own considerations.

122,US Fed raises rates by another three-quarter point amid persistent inflation,Xinhua,2022-07-28," The US Federal Reserve on Wednesday raised its benchmark interest rate by 75 basis points, the second in a row of that magnitude, as elevated inflation showed no clear sign of easing.""Inflation remains elevated, reflecting supply and demand imbalances related to the pandemic, higher food and energy prices, and broader price pressures,"" the Fed said in a statement after a two-day policy meeting, adding that the central bank is ""highly attentive to inflation risks.""""The war (in Ukraine) and related events are creating additional upward pressure on inflation and are weighing on global economic activity,"" the Fed said.The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), the Fed's policy-making body, decided to raise the target range for the federal funds rate to 2.25 to 2.5 percent and ""anticipates that ongoing increases in the target range will be appropriate.""The statement showed that all 12 committee members voted for the decision.The committee noted that it will also continue reducing its holdings of Treasury securities and agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities.The latest move came after the Fed raised its benchmark interest rate by 75 basis points at its June meeting, marking the sharpest rate hike since 1994. The Fed previously raised rates by 25 basis points in March and then by 50 basis points in May.Headline consumer price index (CPI) has remained over 8 percent since March this year, a stark reminder that the Fed has a long way to go to bring elevated inflation under control.

123,"US Fed hikes interest rates by 75 basis points, triggering risk of domestic recession",Global Times,2022-07-28,"Photo taken on March 3, 2020 shows US dollar banknotes in US D.C., the US.(Xinhua/Liu Jie)The US Federal Reserve on Wednesday raised its benchmark interest rate by 75 basis points, in line with market expectation. This marks a second interest hike in a row of that magnitude, as it races to tame inflation running at a four-decade high.Experts said that the aggressive rate hikes won’t solve the woes of US economy but could lead to a possible US recession and put the global economy at risk.The 75 basis points hike matched the magnitude of the Fed's last move in June meeting, which was its largest single-meeting rate increase since 1994. The Fed previously raised rates by 25 basis points in March and then by 50 basis points in May.""Inflation remains elevated, reflecting supply and demand imbalances related to the pandemic, higher food and energy prices, and broader price pressures,"" the Fed said in a statement after a two-day policy meeting, adding that the central bank is ""highly attentive to inflation risks,” Xinhua News Agency reported.The Fed's interest rate increase should alleviate inflation to some extent but with limited impact, as it is rooted by geopolitical conflicts, Dong Dengxin, director of the Finance and Securities Institute of the Wuhan University of Science and Technology, told the Global Times on Thursday.“The Fed's interest rate hike cannot fundamentally solve inflation as the main cause of current inflation is caused by the energy supply shortage under the conflict between Russia and Ukraine and worsened by its suppression on China, the world's largest manufacturing country, with additional tariff on China imports,” Dong said.US’ headline consumer price index (CPI) has remained over 8 percent since March this year. The US consumer price in June surged 9.1 percent from a year ago, hitting a fresh four-decade high, despite its previous interest hikes in the year.In a press conference Wednesday afternoon, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell left the door open for another ""unusually large increase"" at its next meeting in September, but noted that would depend on upcoming economic data, Xinhua reported.Given historical inflation in the US and the Fed’s 2-percent inflation goal, it’s widely expected that the Fed will continue to hike interest rates by 50 basis points in September, Wan Zhe, an economist and professor at the Belt and Road School of Beijing Normal University, told the Global Times on Thursday.However, the frequent interest rate hikes are expected to suppress its economic vitality, putting it at the edge of a recession, experts warned.The sizable financial tightening will probably send the US economy into technical recession in the near future and economic recession may appear in 2023, Wan said.The US economy is estimated to have shrunk at an annual rate of 1.2 percent in the second quarter, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta's GDPNow model updated Wednesday.With a first-quarter decline of 1.6 percent, a second consecutive quarter of negative growth would meet the technical definition of a recession.A US recession is almost inevitable due to its economic structure vulnerabilities, Dong Shaopeng, an expert advisor at the China Securities Regulatory Commission, told the Global Times on Thursday, noting that a long-term hollowing out in US manufacturing and increasing protectionism policies cannot support its sustainable economic growth. The drastic turn in US monetary policies will also bring about negative economic consequences to the world, experts warned.Wan said the US’ move of increasing interest rates to achieve “soft landing” has spillover effects on emerging economies and areas like the EU.Due to the dominant role of US dollar in global settlement, the US’ selfish move has forced many developing economies to follow suit in conducting premature financial tightening so as to contain the risk of capital outflows, placing their own domestic economic growth at risk, experts noted.The rate rise itself creates a cash flow back to the US, drawing capitals from other countries. Higher interest rates will also dampen the vitality of the US economy and reduce its commercial spillovers effect, hurting exports from other countries to the US, Bai Ming, deputy director of the International Market Research Institute at the China Academy of International Trade and Economic Cooperation, told the Global Times on Thursday.Compared with other developing countries and EU countries, China is less dependent on energy imports and therefore is less affected by imported inflation risks, experts said.China's June CPI rose 2.5 percent year-on-year, unchanged month-on-month, still generally moderate, according to data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS).“It is expected that China’s monetary policy operations will focus more to the internal demand of economic development, with a prudent monetary policy,” Bai said.",SOURCE,ECONOMY,Picture description not found,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'US': ('LOC', 7), 'US D': ('LOC', 8), 'C': ('LOC', 1), 'Russia': ('LOC', 1), 'Ukraine': ('LOC', 1), 'China': ('LOC', 2), 'Liu Jie': ('ORG', 1), 'US Federal Reserve': ('ORG', 1), 'Fed': ('ORG', 8), 'Xinhua News Agency': ('ORG', 2), 'Finance and Securities Institute': ('ORG', 1), 'Wuhan University of Science and Technology': ('ORG', 1), 'Global Times': ('ORG', 1), 'Z': ('ORG', 1), 'Dong Dengxin': ('PER', 2), 'Jerome Powell': ('PER', 1), 'Xi': ('PER', 1), 'Wan': ('PER', 1), 'CPI': ('MISC', 1)}"
124,Manage strategic competition to maintain peace and stability of China-US relations: Kevin Rudd,Kevin Rudd,2022-07-28,"At the recent BRICS Summit, China President Xi Jinping posed an important question: ""Where is the world headed: Peace or war? Progress or regression? Openness or isolation? Cooperation or confrontation?"" This is indeed a deeply relevant question for our times, because we live in an increasingly dangerous decade. The possibility of crisis, confrontation and war is no longer unimaginable.Which is why the theme of this forum - peace - is now deeply relevant to security in EU in the face of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the future of US- China relations, and the future of the wider international community.This is therefore time to carefully think through, and calmly reassess, the dangers presented by potential conflicts that could be sparked by today's ever-expanding geopolitical tensions.Unfortunately, the largest of these risks today is the possibility of confrontation, conflict, and even war between China and the US.Even five years ago, this prospect was regarded as absurd, because of the depth and breadth of the strategic, diplomatic, economic engagement between US and Beijing, both regionally and globally.But today we must frankly acknowledge it is no longer unthinkable.Bit by bit, the political and diplomatic insulation around the relationship has been stripped away. It's now a bit like walking into a workshop with exposed wires and cables lying everywhere, water on the floor, and sparks flying everywhere.Conflict - even if it were to begin on a limited scale - between these, the world's two most powerful nations, both militarily and economically, would soon escalate and become catastrophic for both - and indeed for the whole world.However, crisis, conflict, and war are by no means inevitable. Indeed, that is why I have entitled my most recent book ""The Avoidable War."" I don't believe either side has any desire for conflict.As US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a recent speech at the Asia Society: ""There's no reason why our great nations cannot coexist peacefully, and share in and contribute to human progress together.""And yet, for the decade ahead there remains a real, and growing, risk of unintentional crisis, conflict, escalation, and war. How can this be the case? Fundamentally, because both countries are locked into a new form of strategic competition for regional, and eventually global, primacy.China seeks to realize its national ambition of the great rejuvenation of the China nation.And the US intends to remain as the most powerful nation on earth and as the continuing fulcrum of the international order that it constructed out of the ashes of the Second World War.At one level, history tells US competition between nations is in itself natural. On some occasions, it has ended in violence. On others, competition has been conducted peacefully.Within the ideological framework of Marxism-Leninism, there is nothing determinist in dialectical theory that the struggle between opposites must be resolved by violent means.Even Mao's theory of contradiction embraces two forms of struggle: violent and non-violent. Indeed, the actual form of competitive struggle to be embraced, within the wider analytical framework of comprehensive national power, and the changing nature of the balance of international forces, remains a conscious political choice.It is similar within West international relations and strategic theory. Even the deeply realist worldviews of Hans Morgenthau, Kenneth Waltz, John Mearsheimer - including their preoccupation with the security dilemma of all states, the strategic choices associated with the balance of power, and the particular logic of rising powers and established powers - do not imply that war is inevitable.As I see it, the core strategic problem we face today is that the form of strategic competition that is currently unfolding between China and the US is what I describe as ""UN-managed strategic competition."" There are no rules. There are no guardrails. And there is a lot of push and shove - or what dialecticians might describe as action and reaction, with one side seeking through its own efforts to establish a more favorable equilibrium than before.This type of superpower competition also runs the risk of degenerating into blows - unless mutually agreed restraints are developed and agreed and adhered to.The reality is that simply muddling through, in the hope that incidents and escalation can magically be avoided, is wholly insufficient to manage the risks associated with confrontation, conflict, and even war.To avoid sleepwalking into war, as our world has done too many times in the past, there is a deep interest on the part of all countries that both the US and China construct a joint strategic framework to help maintain the peace - or at least to reduce the risk of war by accident. And that they do so quickly.In my book, The Avoidable War, I have proposed one such joint strategic framework, which I call ""Managed Strategic Competition.""The idea is relatively straightforward, although it's execution is not.First, the US and China must have a clear, granular understanding of each other's irreducible strategic redlines in order to help prevent conflict through miscalculation.Each side must conclude that enhancing strategic predictability advantages both countries, that strategic deception is futile, and that strategic surprise is just plain dangerous.This will require a focused, detailed, high-level diplomatic understanding on irreducible national interests in critical domains such as Taiwan, the China Sea, the China Sea, the Korean Peninsula, and cyber and space.And it will include building guardrails into the relationship that can reduce the risk of overreach, miscommunication, and misunderstanding.This process will not be easy. It will require hard, direct conversations and firm resolve. But it is necessary.The central question here is whether strategic stability is best assisted by a process of push and shove as each side seeks to find how far they can go without generating a large-scale reaction. That's unmanaged strategic competition - and I argue that it is now just too dangerous.Or if the alternative is better. Which is to clarify redlines internally, communicate them diplomatically so that each side knows that, if these are violated, there will be consequences. This does not rest on the premise of any level of strategic trust, although trust may be rebuilt over time, based on patterns of consistent security behavior.That's what I call managed strategic competition. And I argued that on balance, it is more stabilizing than the unmanaged alternative, which ultimately rests on the assumption that equilibrium is best achieved through rolling, uncontrolled operational experiment.Second, both countries could then embrace non-lethal strategic competition across much of the rest of their overall relationship. They could channel their strategic rivalry into a competitive race to enhance their economic and technological strength, their foreign policy footprint, and even their military capabilities.This would also involve competition of ideas and ideologies for the future of the international system, including the US concept of a liberal- democratic global order and China's emerging concept of a ""community with a shared future for mankind."" But, crucially, this would be managed competition because it would be non- lethal in nature.Properly constrained, such competition can also reduce the risk of armed conflict, rather than tempting either side to risk everything by prosecuting a dangerous war with unpredictable results out of a sense of systemic necessity.Such strategic competition would also enable both sides to maximize their political, economic, and ideological appeal to the rest of the world.Both would understand and accept that the most competitive national system would ultimately prevail by becoming (or remaining) the world's foremost superpower and eventually shaping the world in its image through the power of its example.And as I have argued elsewhere: may the best system win - both in their respective races to enhance their comprehensive national power, and in the wider court of international opinion as all nations contemplate their futures under a US-led or China-led international order.Third, this framework of managed strategic competition could also create the political and diplomatic space necessary for the two countries to continue to engage in strategic cooperation in those areas where their national interests align, including on pressing global challenges.Neither China nor the US, nor the world, can afford for such cooperation on such challenges to fall by the wayside.Both sides understand this. As President Xi Jinping said, now is a time to ""tide over difficulties together"" in order to pursue cooperation for the global community.Or as Secretary Antony Blinken put it: ""We can't let the disagreements that divide US stop US from moving forward on the priorities that demand that we work together, for the good of our people and for the good of the world.""There are many areas where such cooperation could be pursued. One of them is climate change, a challenge both countries have identified as urgent and impossible to solve without the other. Which is why both have been admirably able to work constructively together on this issue to take meaningful action in the past, including issuing the groundbreaking Glasgow Joint Declaration last year at COP26. Such dialogue and cooperation can and should continue, no matter the two nations' disagreements.Other potential areas of cooperation abound, including global public health and preventing the next pandemic, global food security, and arms control and non-proliferation - including on the Korean Peninsula, where strategic stability is in both nations' strong interest.And, perhaps most pressingly in the short term, we appear to be entering a period of significant global economic and financial stress, especially for the most vulnerable developing nations. Potentially cascading financial, economic, supply chain, and humanitarian risks are multiplying.President Xi Jinping recently stated that now is the time to ""come together with a united purpose and strengthen macroeconomic policy coordination"" in order to avoid a worsening crisis.This should not be an area in which it is impossible for the US and China to make progress and work together to support the world economy - even if only for their own economic benefit. After all, this is what we all managed to do together during the global financial crisis.Importantly, no serious cooperation in any of these areas is likely to go very far unless the US-China relationship can be stabilized by the first two elements of managed strategic competition I've outlined here: strategic guardrails and rules of the road that allow strategic rivalry to be channeled into natural, non- lethal forms of strategic competition. Because, without these steps, the space for cooperation is likely to continue to shrink.Finally, for this compartmentalization of the relationship to have any prospect for success, it would need to be carefully and continuously managed by a dedicated matching of cabinet-level senior officials on both sides.Moreover, this framework would then need to be maintained with a steady hand, no matter what other domestic political or international turmoil might arise.I have no doubt that this approach will face criticism in both US and Beijing for not being sufficiently sensitive to each side's national interests.Hardheads on both sides will likely have the same complaint: that it does not inherently skew the rules of the game so as to ensure the other side will lose, allowing them the opportunity to either grow or prevail as a global superpower.And indeed, this is true. In fact, it is precisely the point! For any strategic framework to manage the relationship to succeed, it needs to be one that both sides can be willing to sign on to, knowing that it can allow them not only to survive, but to flourish. Only then can their competitive spirit remain within non-lethal bounds.Both must have a fair chance to compete and prove that theirs' is the more competitive system - at least for their own people, as well as in the eyes of the world at large.I know some in US will still complain of ""appeasement."" This is false: this framework is based simply on the bedrock of pragmatic, realistic deterrence that can be clear to both sides.Meanwhile I know that some of my friends here in Beijing will argue that it does not account for US's use of its influence to form alliances and networks of friends. That is true - this is one of US's strengths. But this does not prevent China from using its own influence to itself win friends around the world, especially if it can continue to grow and thrive as an attractive business partner, magnanimous friend, and reliable strategic ally.Ultimately, my challenge to critics of Managed Strategic Competition on both sides is simple: Come up with something better. There is little time to waste.I have long studied, lived in, and come to deeply respect both the US and China. The prospect of war between the two nations would truly be not only catastrophic, but a tragedy.And, watching the destruction in Ukraine, I cannot help but recall the memory of marching as a small child in my tiny country hometown's annual ANZAC Day parade - commemorating all those lost in two devastating wars - alongside my father, who had fought in World War II, and alongside elders who had fought in World War I.The world managed to sleepwalk into the tragic and needless slaughter of that first Great War, which claimed more than 15 million lives. With our eyes now wide open, we will have no excuse if we fail to avoid walking into yet another global catastrophe today.Far better to work diligently for peace.The author is former Prime Minister of Australia and President of the Asia Society Policy Institute.

125,Asian investors bet on Haifa as Israel draws closer to Arab Gulf,Reuters,2022-07-28," The city of Haifa is set to become an increasingly significant east Mediterranean shipping hub, with China and India firms buying into its ports as Israel normalizes ties with its Gulf Arab neighbors under a US diplomatic push.Earlier this month, as US President Joe Biden visited the Middle East, India's largest port developer Adani Ports and Israel minority partner Gadot agreed to buy Haifa Port for 4.1 billion shekels ($1.18 billion)Its founder, Asia's richest man Gautam Adani, said on Twitter that the deal was of ""immense strategic and historical significance"", and the company is betting that the port will become a link to EU and create new trade lanes with Asia.A year ago, China rival Shanghai International Port Group (SIPG) said it saw the same potential when it inaugurated its 5.5-billion-shekel Bay Port container shipping terminal next door.Their convergence on Haifa touches on a broader contest among China, India and US interests, said Carice Witte, executive director of SIGNAL, an Israel policy group that specializes in China-Israel relations.""When you see China at a port in Haifa, Haifa now becomes an incredibly important strategic point,"" she said. ""Whereas maybe in the past it was not perceived that way, Israel in general and Haifa very specifically - its relevance as a piece of the puzzle has changed.""The two ports are too big to serve just Israel, and officials expect the underdeveloped bay of Haifa to become a hub for trade and transshipment, meaning the handling of goods that are unloaded in Israel and then sent to other countries.This would have been unthinkable just a decade ago, when Israel was politically isolated from potential trade partners in the region.But while peace talks with the Palestinians remain stuck, Israel has normalized ties with new markets like the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Morocco, all the while forging deeper trade ties with countries in the Far East.""Israel is a very important place, connecting east and West,"" Miao Qiang, CEO of SIPG's Bay Port, said at the terminal's control center. ""All ships from the Suez Canal from east to West are (passing) through this area.""

Night view of Haifa Photo: VCG Regional integrationJust outside, new cargo railways are being constructed that will link into the nationwide network and, should regional integration continue, potentially into Jordan, which could then link up Iraq and Saudi Arabia.Adani Ports did not respond to Reuters' requests for comment. Opher Linchevski, chief executive of Gadot, said the joint venture aimed to benefit from ""the warming relationship between Israel and the Arab Gulf countries"".The expansion of Haifa bay is also expected to alleviate problems with congestion, after crises from COVID-19 lockdowns to Ukraine fed into a global supply chain crunch that earlier this year snarled one-fifth of the global containership fleet in ports.Average ocean dwell times - the period a vessel spends at a port - are currently 2.5 days per load at the Port of Haifa, down from a peak of 3.5 days in May but still 75 percent higher than at the start of the year, data from supply-chain tracking platform FourKites showed.The country's ports currently handle a total of about 3 million standard containers. SIPG expects that to jump to 5 million in five to eight years, at which point Bay Port's capacity could double to 2 million containers, with half of the business dedicated to transshipment.Reuters",SOURCE,ECONOMY,The Haifa port in Israel Photo: VCG,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'Haifa': ('LOC', 6), 'Mediterranean': ('LOC', 1), 'China': ('LOC', 5), 'India': ('LOC', 3), 'Israel': ('LOC', 10), 'Gulf': ('LOC', 1), 'US': ('LOC', 3), 'Middle East': ('LOC', 1), 'Haifa Port': ('LOC', 7), 'Asia': ('LOC', 2), 'Bay Port': ('LOC', 2), 'United': ('LOC', 1), 'Emirates': ('LOC', 1), 'Bahrain': ('LOC', 1), 'Morocco': ('LOC', 1), 'Far East': ('LOC', 1), 'West': ('LOC', 2), 'Mia': ('LOC', 1), 'Suez Canal': ('LOC', 1), 'HaifaGJ': ('LOC', 1), 'Jordan': ('LOC', 1), 'Iraq': ('LOC', 1), 'Arab': ('MISC', 2), 'Palestinians': ('MISC', 1), 'Saudi': ('MISC', 1), 'Joe Biden': ('PER', 1), 'Gautam Adani': ('PER', 1), 'Carice Witte': ('PER', 1), 'Adani Ports': ('ORG', 1), 'Gadot': ('ORG', 1), 'EU': ('ORG', 1), 'Shanghai International Port Group': ('ORG', 1), 'SIPG': ('ORG', 2), 'SIGNAL': ('ORG', 1), 'Qi': ('ORG', 1), 'All': ('ORG', 1)}"
126,Fed's 75 bps rate hike intensifies market fear of US recession,Xie Jun,2022-07-28,"The US Federal Reserve on Wednesday US time moved to raise interest rates by a larger-than-usual 75 basis points (bps), making clear its intention to rein in runaway inflation, while intensifying market fear of a looming US recession that could have serious global implications.The Fed's move may not only accelerate the start of a US recession but may also fail to tame soaring consumer prices, China economists said on Thursday, predicting a US recession may be inevitable. In the short term, the rate hike may further exacerbate capital outflows in emerging market economies, but the impact on China will be limited, experts said.   The Fed's rate hike on Wednesday matched the magnitude of its June hike - the largest single-meeting rate rise since the early 1990s. The Fed raised rates by 25 bps in March and 50 bps in May. The Fed's move, which was largely in line with market expectations, came about two weeks after US government data showed price growth accelerating again last month. The Consumer Price Index, a closely watched inflation metric, soared 9.1 percent in June, marking the fastest pace since November 1981. ""Inflation remains elevated, reflecting supply and demand imbalances related to the pandemic, higher food and energy prices, and broader price pressures,"" the Fed said in a statement after a two-day policy meeting, adding that it is ""highly attentive to inflation risks."" According to Hu Qimu, chief research fellow at the Sinosteel Economic Research Institute, the US is already on a cusp of a technical recession, which is often characterized as two consecutive quarters of GDP contraction, and it's on the way to a formal recession that could last six months to one year. The US economy shrank at an annual rate of 0.9 percent in the second quarter after a 1.6-percent contraction in the previous quarter, the US Commerce Department reported Thursday.""A US recession is almost inevitable due to its economic structural vulnerabilities, since a long-term hollowing out of US manufacturing and increasing protectionism cannot support its sustainable economic growth,"" Dong Shaopeng, an expert advisor at the China Securities Regulatory Commission, told the Global Times on Thursday.Wan Zhe, an economist and professor at the Belt and Road School of Beijing Normal University, also predicted a formal US economic recession in 2023 after a technical recession in the near future. Experts also warned that interest rate hikes might not be as effective in curbing inflation as officials had thought, as the primary factors that drove this round of price hikes have not been removed.The Fed's interest rate increases should alleviate inflation, but only to some extent, as it is rooted in geopolitical conflicts, Dong Dengxin, director of the Finance and Securities Institute of the Wuhan University of Science and Technology, told the Global Times on Thursday.""The Fed's interest rate hikes can't fundamentally solve inflation, because the main cause at present is energy shortages amid the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, worsened by the US' crackdown on China, the world's largest manufacturing country with additional tariffs on China imports,"" Dong said.According to Dong, how long US inflation lasts depends on how radical the Fed's rate hikes are, and whether the US will correct its decoupling from China.Experts said the rate hikes will have a negative impact on global markets, such as affecting US imports as a result of economic cooling. They will also compress the policy space for global central banks, as rising interest rates for the US dollar will trigger capital outflows to the US. But Hu stressed that the impact would be milder on China than on most markets, as the yuan's strengthening would attract more long-term investors, offsetting short-term capital outflows. China stock markets were relatively stable after news of the Fed hike. The benchmark Shanghai Composite Index rose by 0.21 percent, while the smaller Shenzhen index edged up by 0.23 percent. The Hang Seng Index was down 0.23 percent. ""Having conditioned market expectations to anticipate 'jumbo' hikes of 75bps, the Fed delivered on its promise.

127,"Growing cohesion of SCO, attraction of Shanghai Spirit highlighted amid Russia-Ukraine conflict and US-led bloc confrontation",Zhang Hui,2022-07-28,"The Russia-Ukraine conflict and the US' attempt to split the world and demolish the world order through promoting bloc confrontation highlights the growing importance and attraction of Shanghai Spirit, the core value of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) that champions mutual trust, mutual benefit, equality, consultation, respect for diverse civilizations and pursuit of common development, China analysts said on Thursday as foreign ministers of SCO members gathered in Tashkent, Uzbekistan to discuss international and regional issues and SCO cooperation, including projects under the Belt and Road Initiative.Not only are member states of the SCO ready to deepen cooperation, but more Eurasian countries recognize this spirit and are willing to join the organization, they said.  China State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi is attending the meeting of the Council of Foreign Ministers of the SCO in Tashkent, Uzbekistan, from Thursday to Friday and will also be visiting Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan, at the invitation of the three countries' foreign ministers. During a meeting with Acting Foreign Minister Norov Vladimir Imamovich of Uzbekistan on Thursday, Wang said China firmly supports Uzbekistan in safeguarding national sovereignty, security and social stability, and continuing to follow the path of development and revitalization suited to its national conditions, and opposes any external interference in Uzbekistan's internal affairs.The two countries vow to speed up the feasibility study for the China-Kyrgyzstan-Uzbekistan Railway, improve the capacity of the China-Kazakhstan-Uzbekistan Railway and the China-Kyrgyzstan-Uzbekistan expressway and jointly safeguard the safe and stable operation of the China-Central Asia natural gas pipeline. The two countries will tap the potential of agricultural cooperation and build a China-Central Asia Agricultural Cooperation Center.The two sides will expand joint vaccine production, and China supports Uzbekistan in building a regional vaccine production and research center.The situation in Central Asia is facing new challenges due to internal and external factors. Regional countries share the hope to deepen cooperation with China, jointly pursue development and promote security, and look forward to more SCO contributions and commitments, Zhao Lijian, China Foreign Ministry spokesperson said on Tuesday. Wang will attend other multilateral events and make full preparations for the SCO Samarkand Summit later this year with other foreign ministers of SCO member states, Zhao said. China observers said the SCO foreign ministers will focus on regional issues including the Afghan issue and cooperation on economic recovery as the Russia-Ukraine conflict has worsened the global food and energy crisis. The foreign ministers will also discuss implementation of more BRI projects in the SCO members, Zhang Hong, an EU studies expert from the China Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times on Thursday.Against the backdrop of challenges to the world order and an increasingly complex international situation, it is obvious to observers that the rapid development of the SCO's capability in safeguarding regional security and stability, and its attraction to many neighboring countries is becoming more prominent, Zhang said. After his trip to SCO founding states, SCO Secretary-General Zhang Ming said on July 15 that a strong impression from his trip is that SCO members have a strong desire to adhere to the Shanghai Spirit and deepen solidarity of the SCO when dealing with changes in the international situations. It is likely that further discussions on the inclusion of new member states will be discussed at the foreign ministers' meeting so as to further promote the expansion and maturity of the SCO internal cooperation mechanism, Zhang Hong said. The SCO has received 11 applications to join the organization in one or another capacity or to upgrade the status of existing relations, Zhang Ming said on July 15. We expect the SCO heads of state to adopt a memorandum of obligations for the Islamic Republic of Iran to receive SCO membership at the meeting in September, the SCO Secretary-General said. The 2022 annual summit of the SCO Heads of State Council will reportedly be held on September 15-16 in Samarkand, Uzbekistan. As for the concrete format, Zhang Ming said be it online or offline, there are too many unknowns due to the pandemic to make a prediction. In reporting the expansion of the SCO, some West media claimed it is because of NATO's expansion, but observers stressed that the essence of the SCO is not confrontation but regional cooperation, and when some SCO members maintain good cooperation with the West, it is malicious for some countries in the West to smear the SCO as a geopolitical tool. During the foreign ministers' meeting, India media reported that India External Affairs Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar may have a bilateral meeting with Wang to address border issues. Qian Feng, Director of the Research Department of the National Strategy Institute at Tsinghua University, told the Global Times on Thursday that China and India share similar stances on the Russia-Ukraine conflict, dealing with the food and energy crises and stabilizing the region, and if the bilateral talks happen, Wang and Jaishankar may discuss cooperation to further boost the regional economy and security through the SCO platform as well as bilateral topics such as expressing the need of peacefully solving border issues and pushing forward the return of India students to China. Before Thursday and Friday's meeting, Wang and Jaishankar met in person this year twice as bilateral relations have shown a momentum of recovery. The two foreign ministers met on March 25 during Wang's visit to India and on July 7 on the sidelines of the G20 foreign ministers' meeting.Meanwhile, China and India on July 17 held the 16th commander-level talks, the third this year, which marked an overall positive atmosphere between the two neighbors. Some media said the SCO foreign ministers' meeting and following SCO Summit may lead to ice-breaking between China and India, but Qian said this will need more time and actions.",CHINA,DIPLOMACY,SCO Photo:VCG,"Reporter, Beijing","Global Times reporter covering international relations, politics, public health and science.","{'Russia': ('LOC', 2), 'Ukraine': ('LOC', 2), 'US': ('LOC', 1), 'China': ('LOC', 12), 'Tashkent': ('LOC', 2), 'Uzbekistan': ('LOC', 10), 'Kyrgyzstan': ('LOC', 3), 'Tajikistan': ('LOC', 1), 'Kazakhstan': ('LOC', 1), 'Central Asia': ('LOC', 3), 'Shanghai Spirit': ('MISC', 1), 'Belt and Road Initiative': ('MISC', 1), 'Eurasian': ('MISC', 1), 'Railway': ('MISC', 2), 'Afghan': ('MISC', 1), 'Shanghai Cooperation Organization': ('ORG', 1), 'SCO': ('ORG', 9), 'Council of': ('ORG', 1), 'Asia Agricultural Cooperation Center': ('ORG', 1), 'Li': ('ORG', 1), 'Wang Yi': ('PER', 3), 'Norov Vladimir Imamovich': ('PER', 1), 'Zhao': ('PER', 2)}"
128,"Washington’s self-serving scheme toxicant, not antidote to Indo-Pacific region",Wang Wenwen,2022-07-28,"Defense chiefs from 26 countries across the Indo-Pacific gathered for a three-day meeting in Sydney this week in an attempt to deal with the so-called ""China's ongoing campaign to expand its influence and military presence in the region.""General Mark Milley, chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff, said the military leaders were focused on ""the whole situation with the rise of China, a free and open Pacific"" and ensuring a peaceful and stable Indo-Pacific region.In May, US President Joe Biden launched the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity during his visit in Japan, giving the Strategy an economic push. Senior US officials have also intensively made visits to Indo-pacific countries since this year as political and diplomatic maneuvers. Sun Xihui, an associate research fellow with the National Institute of International Strategy at the China Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times that this meeting is part of the US efforts to push forward its Indo-Pacific Strategy in the military domain. It took place when the 2022 Rim of the Pacific exercise is underway.In Australia, Milley repeated clichés that China has become more aggressive and wants to bully and dominate the Indo-Pacific region as opposed to having a free and open Indo-Pacific. But the US is measuring China's corn by its own bushel. It is the US that views leadership and dominance as a priority of its foreign policy. The so-called free and open Indo-Pacific is nothing but the US' values-based rhetoric with an attempt to discredit China. With such rhetoric, the US tries to rope in the so-called like-minded nations to make China a common enemy so that it can enlarge its own friends circle while at the same time isolating China.It is clear that the US tries to turn the Indo-Pacific into a stepping stone of its containment of China. It touts freedom and openness, but it makes the region narrow-minded and exclusive. It catalyzes every potential dispute so as to deeply get involved in the region and deepen regional countries' dependence on it. To regional countries, the US is more like a toxicant than an antidote.Sun said that the US wants to create a belief that it has many friends and partners in the Indo-Pacific. Nonetheless, most countries in the region have no will to engage in a military confrontation with China. The more countries the US ropes in, the more different interests are involved. It will be difficult for the US to coordinate all these interests together to confront China.The US attaches a great deal of importance to its leadership in global and regional security. But it is the US itself that always puts global and regional security in peril. In the Indo-Pacific, the US relies on a security framework built on its alliance system. Based on its alliance system, it hopes to expand the framework, with itself as the core and at the top, its allies at the second level and partners at the third. By playing up the ""China threat"", the US is excluding China from this framework.But it needs to be stressed that a security framework in the Indo-Pacific without China will not work. In the region, despite large US deployments, no military conflict breaks out. But in EU, where the US deploys fewer forces especially fewer naval forces, crisis management and control in EU has almost lost control, with the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict and the risk of a confrontation between the US and Russia. Song Zhongping, a China military expert and TV commentator, told the Global Times that it is due to the fact that China and the US have managed and controlled these crises, especially China's proper handling of its relations with the US and other regional countries. However, if the US keeps provoking China over China's sovereignty, security and development interests, a crisis may occur.Song believes the establishment of a security framework requires participant countries to adhere to the UN Charter, rather than interfering in the internal affairs of other countries, and respecting the core interests of other countries. Nonetheless, such a balanced security framework does not serve US hegemony and interests. That's how global and regional tensions brew. The author is a reporter with the Global Times. wangwenwen@globaltimes.com.cn",OPINION,VIEWPOINT,Indo-Pacific Illustration: Liu Rui/GT,"Reporter, Beijing",Chief reporter of the Global Times.

129,International garment industry struggling to cope with US ban on Xinjiang cotton,Yin Yeping,2022-07-27,"International fashion industry representatives have found themselves in an unprecedented situation as they are being forced to make a hard choice between cotton-related goods from China's Xinjiang region, a key global supplier, and elsewhere, as a result of the recent US import ban on all Xinjiang-related goods due to claims about ""forced labor."" The administration of US President Joe Biden is trying to crack down on Xinjiang cotton and this has caused major problems for global industry participants, including those from countries in Asia, which are major suppliers for US garment companies. This comes at a time when the global supply chain is already facing high raw material costs, logistical hurdles and inflation, industry insiders said.AI Mamun Mridha, joint secretary general of the Bangladesh China Chamber of Commerce and Industry (BCCCI), told the Global Times in a recent written interview that Bangladesh is well aware of the US ban and is monitoring the issue very closely.""We are against any kind of restrictions on free business. Ultimately, the business community and their consumer base around the world suffers badly due to this one-sided decision,"" Mridha said, noting that the world is still suffering from COVID-19 and the Russia-Ukraine conflict, and the US move will have a negative impact all over the world, including Bangladesh.While Bangladesh does not import much cotton from Xinjiang, almost 60-70 percent of the country's yarn and fabric comes from China, the 2nd-largest garment producer in the world, according to the BCCCI.""It's very hard to differentiate which yarn or fabric was or was not manufactured using cotton from China's Xinjiang region ... we are anxious about our supply chain as it is heavily inclined toward China and many of our members are large garment and textile manufacturers, so this decision has put them under huge pressure,"" Mridha noted.Mridha said that their main markets for garment products are in EU, and the US also buys garments from them.Recently, the country passed the $52 billion mark for exports, and among that almost $42 billion came from exports of garments and textiles, according to the BCCCI.The Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act (UFLPA), which came into force on June 21 after being signed into law by Joe Biden on December 23, 2021, assumes that any product partly or wholly made in Xinjiang, is linked to the US hyped ""forced labor"" claim and subject to an import ban.While some global industry representatives have managed to find other sources of imports to avoid falling victim to the ban, the industry is still in a tough position amid high inflation and rising cost pressures.In the ninth annual Fashion Industry Benchmarking Study recently released by the US Fashion Industry Association (USFIA), it shows that US fashion companies are adopting a more diverse sourcing base in response to supply chain disruptions and the need to mitigate growing sourcing risks. But Asia remains the dominant base of sources for US fashion companies; eight of the top 10 most-utilized sourcing destinations are in Asia, led by China, Vietnam, Bangladesh, and India.Reducing ""China exposure"" is one crucial driver of US fashion companies' sourcing diversification strategy, the USFIA said, especially with the implementation of the UFLPA.The USFIA claimed that one-third of their surveyed respondents report sourcing less than 10 percent of their apparel products from China this year, but the association admitted that over 95 percent of respondents said they expect the UFLPA to affect their sourcing.Compared with finished garments, US fashion companies' textile raw material sourcing seems less diversified.Asia, particularly China, continues to play a dominant role as a textile supplier, especially for fabrics and accessories, providing 93.8 percent and 87.5 percent respectively of the respondents' total imports, according to the USFIA.Vietnam, another major player in the global fashion supply chain, has also felt the impact of supply chain disruption due to the US ban.Do Pham Ngoc Tu, vice chairperson and secretary general of Vietnam Cotton & Spinning Association (VCOSA), told the Global Times that Vietnamese firms will need to wean themselves off raw materials produced in China's Xinjiang region in order to ensure long-term access to the US market.Xinjiang produces 20 percent of the world's cotton. It is sent to countries in Southeast Asia, woven into a shirt or other piece of clothing, and then shipped on to the US - 16 percent of the clothing in the US contains cotton fiber from Xinjiang, Do Pham Ngoc Tu noted.In order to abide by the new US law targeting China's Xinjiang goods, Vietnamese manufacturers must prepare documents to prove due diligence in evaluation of their supply chain, and the manufacturer must replace materials from Xinjiang, or they must fulfill corresponding documents.Regarding the impact of the Xinjiang cotton ban, the issue mostly affects the garment manufacturers, not spinners in Vietnam, the vice chairperson said.""But for apparel businesses, finding new sources to replace China fabrics will prove more challenging,"" said Do Pham Ngoc Tu.",SOURCE,ECONOMY,"A cotton harvesting machine works in a field in Manas County, Hui Autonomous Prefecture of Changji, northwest China's Xinjiang region.

131,US responsible for Russia’s decision to quit space cooperation: experts,Deng Xiaoci,2022-07-27,"Yury Borisov, the newly appointed chief of Russia space agency Roscosmos, reported to Russia's President Vladimir Putin on Tuesday that Russia will withdraw from the International Space Station (ISS) after 2024. Although Borisov's predecessor, Dmitry Rogozin, had repeatedly threatened to do this before, China analysts urged the US to take the warning seriously and reflect on its irresponsible sanctions against Russia that left the latter with no choice.""You know that we are working within the framework of international cooperation at the International Space Station. Undoubtedly, we will fulfil all our obligations to our partners, but the decision to leave the station after 2024 has been made,"" Borisov told Vladimir Putin, media reports said.US News network CNN cited a transcript of a meeting posted to the Kremlin's website, and Vladimir Putin said ""good"" after Borisov told him that Roscosmos will begin to build its own space station after 2024. NASA Administrator Bill Nelson said the agency ""is committed to the safe operation of the ISS through 2030, and is coordinating with our partners. NASA has not been made aware of decisions from any of the partners, though we are continuing to build future capabilities to assure our major presence in low-Earth orbit,"" the US network CBS News reported.  Launched in 2000, the ISS has been widely viewed as a model of international cooperation and a symbol of post-Cold War cooperation between former rivals the US and Russia, which are also the world's two space superpowers. The latest development suggests Russia has come to a point where it has had enough of US humiliation and sanctions, including those predating Russia's military operation in Ukraine, so that Moscow no longer wants any form of cooperation with US, an expert in international relations told the Global Times on the condition of anonymity. Russia has found itself in a situation in which it has to punish the US, and as it is pulling out of the ISS, it shows the room for cooperation between Russia and the US is shrinking, the expert noted. If Russia quits the ISS, it would be a huge setback for the common cause for mankind to jointly explore space, and US political manipulation and irresponsible acts would be to blame, he said.CNN also quoted US State Department spokesperson Ned Price as saying that news that Russia will withdraw from the ISS is ""an unfortunate development given the critical scientific work performed at the ISS [and] the valuable professional collaboration our space agencies have had over the years, especially in light of our renewed agreement on spaceflight cooperation.""The ISS is made up of two primary segments, one managed by NASA and the other by Roscosmos. Russia provides the propellant and thrusters needed to keep the outpost in orbit while NASA provides most of the station's electrical power, satellite communications and the day-to-day stability provided by four massive gyroscopes, according to CBS News. If Russia withdraws from the ISS, it would mean that Russia-US space cooperation would end and the US' attempt to get Russia onboard with its lunar programs would be only a dream, Song Zhongping, a military expert and TV commentator, told the Global Times. Song pointed out that the US could sustain the ISS without Russia but with way heavier costs. ""New investment is called for on research and development for replacement of Russia technology, which can be seen as Russia hitting back at sanctions from the US.""NASA recently tested its own reboost capability using a Northrop Grumman Cygnus cargo ship, but according to CBS News the agency does not have the capability yet to provide all the propellant and thrusting needed if Russia does, in fact, pull out. Why has Russia set the date of 2024 for pulling out? Analysts said that it could suggest the matter might be an area for political wrestling in the coming couple of years, with Russia pressuring the US to make concessions over trade. NASA said in February it intends to keep operating the ISS until the end of 2030, after which the ISS will be deorbited and crashed into a remote part of the Pacific Ocean. Commercially operated space platforms would replace the ISS as a venue for collaboration and scientific research, NASA said.Some space observers have suggested that Russia's withdrawal from the project might result in the ISS being cancelled before the set schedule of 2030, so that the US could use the money saved for the building of future commercial outposts. Or NASA might spend the budget on the Artemis program instead, they said. Pang Zhihao, a Beijing-based space expert, said it is unlikely that China will become a partner when Russia develops its own orbital stations after 2024 as China is building its own Tiangong China Space Station, but China will surely welcome Russia for space cooperation.China is ready to work with all countries and regions that are committed to the peaceful use of outer space to carry out more international cooperation and exchanges, Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin said on April 18 at a daily news briefing.Wang said foreign astronauts are welcome to visit China's space station and work with China astronauts to jointly explore the mysteries of the universe and build a community with a shared future for mankind.",CHINA,SOCIETY,A file photo of the International Space Station.,"Reporter, Beijing",Global Times reporter tracking China's space programs and cutting-edge science and technology projects.,"{'Yury Borisov': ('PER', 4), 'Vladimir Putin': ('PER', 3), 'Dmitry Rogozin': ('PER', 1), 'Bill Nelson': ('PER', 1), 'Russia': ('LOC', 11), 'International Space Station': ('LOC', 2), 'ISS': ('LOC', 3), 'China': ('LOC', 1), 'US': ('LOC', 10), 'Kremlin': ('LOC', 1), 'Ukraine': ('LOC', 1), 'Moscow': ('LOC', 1), 'Roscosmos': ('ORG', 2), 'CNN': ('ORG', 2), 'NASA': ('ORG', 2), 'CBS News': ('ORG', 1), 'Global Times': ('ORG', 1), 'IS': ('ORG', 4), 'Department': ('ORG', 1), 'Ned': ('ORG', 1), 'Earth': ('MISC', 1), 'post': ('MISC', 1), 'Cold War': ('MISC', 1)}"
132,Rubio’s bill to sanction China’s purchase of Russian oil ridiculous,Wang Jiamei,2022-07-27,"US Republican Senator Marco Rubio, known for his radical anti-China views, along with fellow Republicans, on Tuesday introduced a bill that is seeking to sanction China's purchases of oil and other energy supplies from Russia, according to a Bloomberg report.The bill is aimed at cutting off funding to Russia by imposing penalties on any entity insuring or registering tankers shipping oil or liquefied natural gas to China from Russia, according to Rubio's office. Any entity, including China state-run companies helping Russia should face serious consequences, Rubio said in a statement.With the US midterm election approaching, it is not surprising to see radical anti-China politicians like Rubio dream up such a new bill to gain media attention amid the US' poisonous political climate, in which politicians compete over toughness on China instead of solutions to countless US domestic issues. The move lays bare the US politicians' ignorance and lack of common sense when it comes to US economic woes, some of which were actually caused or exacerbated by the US' relentless sanctions on other countries.Since the Russia-Ukraine conflict broke out, there has been concern about the possibility of the US and its allies imposing secondary sanctions against China over the China-Russia energy trade. But anyone who holds the idea needs to know how far-fetched and dangerous such sanctions could be. For starters, while Russia is under sanctions from the West, countries that have not joined the West sanctions are not subject to the restrictions when it comes to purchases of Russia oil and other energy supplies. Every country has the right to decide where to buy energy products from based on their own needs and interests. Indeed, it is not just large oil importers such as China and India that are buying Russia oil these days. EU countries will continue their purchases, too. Last week, the EU said it would allow EU companies to purchase Russia seaborne crude oil and to ship oil to third countries under an adjustment of sanctions agreed by member states.With so many countries and entities around the world continuing purchases of Russia crude oil, where on earth did these politicians derive the confidence and reason to propose such an absurd bill against China's purchase alone? Had they really studied what is going on in the global energy market before introducing such a ridiculous bill?Over the past few months, global crude oil markets have been buffeted by a series of supply problems, which have led to international oil prices staying close to $100 a barrel, a relatively high level compared to previous years. Amid tight supply, US President Joe Biden even urged Saudi Arabia to boost oil production during a visit in mid-July.With global crude oil still in tight supply, if China's purchase of Russia oil is hindered, one possible outcome is that the world's largest crude importer will have to compete with other buyers for oil supplies from the Middle East or elsewhere. This will not only cause huge disruption to global energy supply and demand patterns, but will also drive up oil prices significantly, a disaster for the US economy with its inflation hitting four-decade high.In fact, the idea of imposing sanctions on entities helping China's purchases of Russia oil is even at odds with what senior officials in US is up to. In order to tame the high inflation, the Joe Biden administration has made it clear that it aims to keep oil supplies flowing while limiting Russia's energy revenue by putting a price cap on Russia's oil prices. In this sense, the ridiculous bill to sanction Russia oil sales to China is unlikely to pass, but it still shows how chaotic US politics is. It is in this chaotic political soil that radical and irrational politicians like Rubio can politicize almost any issue regardless of facts and economic rules, thus aggravating its domestic economic problems to gradually become a crisis for the world.The author is an editor with the Global Times. bizopinion@globaltimes.com.cn",SOURCE,ECONOMY,Illustration: Tang Tengfei/Global Times,"Reporter, Shanghai","Global Times reporter covering global political economy and development, international trade and investment.","{'US': ('LOC', 8), 'China': ('LOC', 10), 'Russia': ('LOC', 11), 'Ukraine': ('LOC', 1), 'West': ('LOC', 2), 'India': ('LOC', 1), 'Republican': ('MISC', 1), 'Republicans': ('MISC', 1), 'anti': ('MISC', 1), 'Marco Rubio': ('PER', 4), 'Bloomberg': ('ORG', 1), 'EU': ('ORG', 3)}"
133,"Widodo starts China trip, to focus on trade, mutual coordination on regional affairs",Zhao Yusha,2022-07-26,"With President Joko Widodo of the Republic of Indonesia being the first foreign leader to visit China since the Winter Olympic Games in February this year, the ties between China and Indonesia are set to witness an all-round upgrade after his visit, China observers said on Monday. They noted that both sides are not only eyeing to uplift cooperation on trade and infrastructure, but also inching toward cooperation on building ""a community with a shared future for mankind"" and upholding multilateralism and fair development for international community.Observers also said that China has always appreciated Indonesia's determination to stand up against hegemony and to stick to a non-alignment approach. They believe Indonesia's stance and devoted efforts in promoting fair global development will not only win China's support in the upcoming G20 summit, but will also help the country, as well as the whole ASEAN, to choose what is best for them, excluding the US-made cacophony of a so-called China threat.Lu Kang, China Ambassador to Indonesia, posted on Twitter on Monday afternoon that Widodo started his trip to China. At the invitation of China President Xi Jinping, Widodo was scheduled to visit China from Monday to Tuesday, China Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying announced on Thursday.During Widodo's visit, Xi Jinping will hold talks with him, and China Premier Li Keqiang will also meet with the Indonesian president, Hua said. When asked about Widodo's detailed schedule in China, Zhao Lijian, spokesperson of  Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said at a routine briefing on Monday ""it's the first high-level visit we're going to receive after the Beijing Winter Olympic Games, and I would like to say that we have gained useful experience during the Olympics."" Zhao said that China will do its utmost to guarantee a safe and successful visit through effective virus prevention work. China is the first leg of Widodo's three-country tour of Asia. After Beijing, the Indonesian president will also visit Japan and South Korea for talks with their respective leaders, Indonesian media Jakarta Globe reported. Being the first foreign head of state to visit China since the Beijing Winter Olympic Games in February, Widodo's visit is seen by experts as symbolizing the significance of bilateral ties between China and ASEAN members. Indonesian Foreign Minister Retno Marsudi said the focus of the Indonesian president's upcoming visits to China, Japan and South Korea ""is to strengthen economic cooperation, especially in trade and investment,"" Jakarta Globe reported on July 21.China experts also anticipated trade will top Widodo's agenda during his visit in China. Xu Liping, a research fellow on Southeast Asia studies at the China Academy of Social Sciences in Beijing, told the Global Times on Monday that during his term, Widodo has been looking forward to attracting foreign investment and expanding trade. Also during his term, the trade volume between China and Indonesia doubled, which is a marvelous achievement, said Xu.Statistics show that the bilateral trade volume between Indonesia and China reached more than $120 billion in 2021, an increase of 58.6 percent compared with the same period last year, despite the onslaught of COVID-19, and the rate of increase tops that of other ASEAN members. When meeting with visiting China State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi in Jakarta on July 11, both Widodo and Wang agreed to accelerate cooperation on major landmark projects such as the Jakarta-Bandung High Speed Railway, the regional comprehensive economic corridor and some industrial parks. Indonesia has obtained massive achievements under the China-proposed Belt and Road Initiative, and it is in the country that the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road was proposed, said Xu. He noted that China may seek to renew the memorandum of pushing forward the initiative and Indonesia's construction of Global Maritime Fulcrum during Widodo's visit. According to observers, the cooperation between China and Indonesia goes beyond just trade and specific projects and it is diverse and wide-ranging. Xu said that China has already set up a perfect example of building ""a community with a shared future for mankind"" with Laos and Cambodia, if state leaders of China and Indonesia can reach a consensus with the same aim, it will be a huge breakthrough. Experts also hailed Indonesia as a partner standing with China in upholding multilateralism and promoting fair global development. The 17th G20 Heads of State and Government Summit will take place in October 2022 in Bali, Indonesia. Under the Indonesian presidency, the G20 will focus on the theme of ""Recover Together, Recover Stronger.""Xu said that as this year's G20 meeting focuses on economic recovery, Indonesia has also invited many developing countries to participate. ""Thus it needs the support and coordination of China, and will rely on China to give a voice representing those developing countries, and to push for equitable growth,"" said Xu.The expert also noted Indonesia wishes that the summit won't be overshadowed by the Russia-Ukraine crisis, as the West keeps hyping and blackening Russia's role in G20 talks due to the crisis. US President Joe Biden even called for Russia's removal from the G20 in March, according to the Reuters.In a recent interview with China Central Television on Friday, Lu Kang said that Indonesia has been insisting that all members of G20 should participate equally, and no country has the power to decide which other countries can participate in the G20. China firmly supports Indonesia in this regard. Xu noted that Indonesia, being an emerging economy and regional power, plays an important role in coordinating regional affairs, and Widodo's visit can enhance the coordination and cooperation between China and Indonesia, which in turn will help lift the international community out of the global economic downturn caused by COVID-19 and push for regional stability. US cacophonyWhile the Indonesian president starts his China tour, the US keeps harping on the ""China threat"" cacophony in Indonesia. US Army General Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said while visiting Indonesia on Sunday that the China military ""in the air and at sea, have become significantly more and noticeably more aggressive in this particular region.""In response, Zhao said the US total military expenditure ranks first in the world. On top of that, it has recently submitted a proposed Fiscal Year 2023 Budget request of about $813 billion for defense. The US runs more than 800 overseas military bases globally, and has only not waged wars for 16 years since it was founded.""Who's been dispatching military vessels and aircraft abroad to flex its muscles? Who's been challenging regional peace, security and stability? And who is more aggressive? The facts speak for themselves,"" Zhao said. On Tuesday, the US will host a virtual meeting of officials representing the 14 countries that have joined the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework, as US seeks to expand its engagement with Asia. The ministerial meeting will be hosted by US Trade Representative Katherine Tai and Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo, their offices announced in a statement on Sunday.The USs intention to rope in Indonesia to its side is evident, given the frequent visits of US officials to the Southeast Asia country by either the US vice president, secretary of state, defense minister or a visiting US general, Xu said.Despite continuous US moves to woo Indonesia, the country has not been swayed; instead, the country insists on its national policy of being an independent country and taking no sides between China and the US so as to remain neutral. Indonesia, as one of the advocates and initiators of non-aligned movement, could be seen as a pioneer of anti-imperialism. As one of the organizers of the 1955 Bandung Conference, where non-aligned and newly independent nations gathered to agree on a set of core principles in international relations, Indonesia spoke out against hegemony and declared the its ambition and determination to support the justice on the international stage as China did, Xu explained. ""No matter how the US sow discord and create differences between Indonesia and China, US won't get anything out of it.""",CHINA,DIPLOMACY,China Indonesia Photo:VCG,"Reporter, Beijing","Global Times reporter covering international affairs, politics and society.","{'Joko Widodo': ('PER', 5), 'Lu Kang': ('PER', 1), 'Xi Jinping': ('PER', 2), 'Hua Chunying': ('PER', 2), 'Li Keqiang': ('PER', 1), 'Zhao Lijian': ('PER', 2), 'W': ('PER', 2), 'Republic of Indonesia': ('LOC', 5), 'China': ('LOC', 18), 'Asia': ('LOC', 1), 'Beijing': ('LOC', 2), 'Japan': ('LOC', 2), 'South Korea': ('LOC', 2), 'Jakarta Globe': ('LOC', 1), 'Winter Olympic Games': ('MISC', 2), 'G20': ('MISC', 1), 'US': ('MISC', 1), 'Indonesian': ('MISC', 5), 'Beijing Winter Olympic Games': ('MISC', 1), 'Olympics': ('MISC', 1), 'ASEAN': ('ORG', 1), 'Foreign Ministry': ('ORG', 1), 'Ministry of Foreign Affairs': ('ORG', 1), 'ASEA': ('ORG', 1), 'Re': ('ORG', 1), 'Mars': ('ORG', 1)}"

136,Open letter to UN High Commissioner for human rights,chinadaily.com.cn,2022-07-26," Dear Madame High Commissioner Michelle Bachelet,During your visit to China including Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region in late May, you had extensive exchanges with representatives from different sectors. We believe that you saw with your own eyes that Xinjiang has enjoyed sustained economic development, social stability, improvement of people's livelihood, cultural prosperity and religious harmony. You gained a good knowledge of the fact and truth that people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang enjoy various forms of human rights in accordance with law. We expect that , you will draw a conclusion based on the facts, and present what you saw and heard in Xinjiang to the international community in an objective and fair manner.We notice that for a period of time, certain anti-China forces, out of ulterior political motives, have publicly urged you to release the so-called assessment on Xinjiang, which is against the objective facts and confuses right and wrong. We express our serious concerns regarding this. It is reported that the assessment is entirely based on false accusations fabricated by anti-China forces and false testimony by overseas anti-China separatists, and echoes the biggest lies of the century that there are so-called genocide, crimes against humanity, forced labour, forced sterilization, religious repression in Xinjiang. Such an assessment is completely untrue. The assessment, once released, will be definitely used by certain countries as a political tool to interfere in China's internal affairs and to contain China's development under the pretext of human rights. It will badly damage the credibility of Madame High Commissioner yourself and the OHCHR, and seriously undermine the developing countries' confidence in constructive cooperation with the OHCHR. It will deeply hurt the sentiments of all 1.4 billion China people including the 25 million in Xinjiang and of all who support the development of Xinjiang. We are strongly opposed to the release of such an unreasonable, unauthorized, and untruthful assessment.Facts should never be distorted. Truth should never be denied. We strongly call on you and the OHCHR to abide by the purposes and principles of the UN Charter, respect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all countries, respect the authoritative information provided by member states, and respect the serious concerns raised by all China people and all people championing justice around the world. We call on you and the OHCHR to stand on the right side of history, and not to release an assessment full of lies.Yours sincerely,Signatories:1. China NGO Network for International Exchanges2.

137,"Coordinated efforts, rather than questioning BRI, are key to tackling global risks",Global Times,2022-07-26,"Editor's Note: While the China-proposed Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) has greatly contributed to global infrastructure connectivity and injected new dynamics into global growth, it has also become a target of West slandering and propaganda against China. Anti-China forces have touted the mega plan as creating ""debt trap"" that embroiled a number of developing economies, including Sri Lanka, into debt crisis. To rebut such groundless accusation, the Global Times (Global Times) recently conducted interviews with Sébastien Treyer, executive director of the Paris-based think tank the Institute for Sustainable Development and International Relations (IDDRI), who has long focused on the sustainable development of the global economy.This is the first piece of a series of Global Times's interviews with influential scholars from West think tanks that aims to present a whole picture of BRI projects. 

In recent days, the situation in Sri Lanka has garnered global attention. In addition to Sri Lanka, a number of emerging economies are also near or at debt distress. In terms of dealing with the exacerbated financial woes faced by emerging economies, the most important event was last year's G20 summit, where there was an agreement to have a common monitoring framework about debt owed to the Paris Club, meaning the West countries as well as to other economies like China. It was one of the efforts to monitor the debt of countries that ask for more investments and financial flows from EU, from Northern US, Japan and China donors.It is of vital importance that these countries can monitor together in a cooperative way, rather than questioning the China-proposed Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). G20 discussion is now in danger because of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, and this may lead to the difficulty in finding agreements and solutions in the G20 context. I hope that the Indonesian presidency will be able to push forward common debt monitoring framework in this year's upcoming G20 Summit. I hope West OECD donors and China could put all analytical energy and political energy to find cooperative ways on how to be cautious about the debt crisis in developing countries and how they can contribute in a cooperative manner to help them out of the current debt crisis.It is also important to think of global cooperation from financial institutions, the central banks, the IMF and the World Bank to ensure that inflation increases in a way that does not lead to a global recession in the economies. 

Containers at Nantong-Haimen Sea Port in Nantong, China's Jiangsu Province Photo:VCGThe impact of the Russia-Ukraine conflict on global food security, energy and finance is systemic, serious and increasing. The Russia-Ukraine conflict leads to increases in prices of gas and food, as well as raging inflation. Addressing global inflation calls for concrete macroeconomic policies that need to be coordinated between central banks and across region.A number of infrastructure initiatives have being put forward in recent years, like the Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment (PGII) and the EU's Global Gateway scheme. PGII is an overall framework for all G7 countries. And the EU program, the Global Gateway, is within the PGII program. Those schemes are trying to build on the needs of the recipients, who are the developing countries.It is very important that we are able to monitor the realization, the implementation of those initiatives, and to monitor whether or not they fit into what the developing countries really look for. It's also very important to evaluate progress and to ensure the implementation of these projects. They should be aligned with the stability objectives and the sustainable development of developing countries.Government and social assessment of BRI projects in the Global South showed that since 2013, there has been a lot of progress on better integrating environmental and social impact of the BRI projects in southern countries - mostly in developing countries in Africa and Asia.If we want them to contribute to green and decarbonize economy in those countries where the BRI projects are taking place, it should also be stressed that global cooperation efforts are needed for green and standard developments in Southern countries. In this regard, the BRI proposed by China is an important contributor to financing green and sustainable investments in Southern countries.

Political leaders, scholars and representatives from the UN praised China's contribution to safeguarding and promoting human rights domestically and internationally. Padma Choling, vice chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPC) and president of China Society for Human Rights Studies, said at the opening ceremony that the world is entering a new period of turbulence and countries around the world need to work together to improve global governance for human rights and to have consensus on how to develop human rights.Huang Mengfu, vice chairman of the 11th National Committee of the China People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) and chairman of the China Foundation for Human Rights Development, said that due to the unilateralism and power politics practiced by a few countries, the international order of human rights and the basis for better global governance are facing serious challenges.Danilo Türk, former president of Slovenia, said via video link that ""The need for global cooperation has never been as urgent as it is today. The cause of human rights will be served best when global cooperation is improved - and when the currently prevailing geopolitical and ideological tensions are reduced."" ""Cooperation should be given precedence over competition and confrontation. This is not only a political and developmental requirement. This is also a requirement of human rights,"" he said.Alena Douhan of Belarus, the UN Special Rapporteur on the Negative Impact of Unilateral Coercive Measures on the Enjoyment of Human Rights, raised concerns over the unilateral sanctions launched by the West. ""With great regret, I have to admit that unilateral coercive measures constitute today one of the most serious challenges to solidarity, universality, development and human rights protection,"" Douhan said. ""Every day we witness new unilateral sanctions being imposed over individuals, companies, sectors of the economy, the economy in general and individuals and companies cooperating with those who have already been designated or sought to become designated in future, or even those who might commit future acts not favored by sanctioning states,"" she said via video link.President of China International Communications Group Du Zhanyuan said that security is the precondition for improving development and safeguarding human rights. ""In recent years, regional conflicts, including the Ukraine crisis, are getting frequent, and this has caused serious food and energy crises,"" Du said, adding that the economic and sci-tech sanctions imposed by some countries have caused global inflation.Economic and secondary sanctions enhanced by over-compliance result in growing unemployment, involvement in the gray economy, corruption, sexual exploitation and criminality, especially affecting those who are the most vulnerable and need better protection: the poorest, women, people living in the remote area and indigenous population, children and people suffering from chronical and severe disease, Douhan said.""Human rights can only be protected and achieved if cooperation, dialogue, the rule of law and prohibition of discrimination and of double standards are applied by every state and every international organization as grounds for international relations,"" she noted.She said ""Unilateral sanctions shall still be viewed as a common and easy to use political tool. It's not at all of good guides against bad ones. A legality and humanitarian impact assessment shall be done before any measure is taken by any state used in precautionary approach.""Attendees praised China's contribution toward improving the human rights internally and globally. Tahir Farooq, editor-in-chief of the Daily Ittehad of Pakistan, said via video link that ""Over the past four decades since the launch of reform and opening-up, China has lifted over 700 million people out of poverty, accounting for over 70 percent of poverty reduction worldwide."" ""This makes China the largest contributor to the global effort of poverty eradication. China has created jobs for 770 million people, and has established the world's largest education, social insurance and primary-level democratic election systems,"" Farooq noted. Bhofal Chambers, Speaker of the House of Representatives of Liberia, praised the efforts made by the Communist Party of China and the China government to solve global human rights problems, including China's aid to help other countries promote women and children's rights, as well as UN peacekeeping missions. He said China is a great power to promote and safeguard global human rights. The Beijing Forum on Human Rights has been held every year since 2008, attracting officials and human rights experts and scholars from countries and regions in the world. The forum provides a platform for current and former political leaders, diplomats, experts and scholars from China and abroad to review the history of the world's human rights development, to communicate with each other and lay the foundation for future cooperation.",CHINA,DIPLOMACY,Beijing Forum on Human Rights held at Beijing Conference Center on July 26.

139,Bottom line on Taiwan question will be shaped through fight with US: Chinese scholar,Zheng Yongnian,2022-07-25,"Editor's Note:China has warned of ""strong and resolute measures"" against US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's planned trip to Taiwan island in August. If she does make the visit, what will it mean for the situation in the Taiwan Straits? What short-term and long-term impact will it have on China-US relations? What measures should China take? Zheng Yongnian (Zheng), professor at the China University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen, and president of the Institute for International Affairs, Qianhai, talked with Global Times (Global Times) reporters Wang Wenwen over these issues.Global Times: In response to Pelosi's planned visit, US President Joe Biden said in response that the US military thinks Pelosi's trip is ""not a good idea right now,"" adding that ""I don't know what the status of it is."" How would you interpret Joe Biden's words?Zheng: The current US government is generally semi-paralyzed and divided. As US House speaker, Pelosi has not coordinated with the president, and many things that the president aims to do would be vetoed by the Congress. The US government is not an example of checks and balances right now, with every one doing their own thing without any coordination.Pelosi reportedly planned to visit Taiwan in April, but the trip was cancelled after she tested positive for COVID-19. There were speculations saying it was due to the pressure from the US military. This time, according to Joe Biden's words, the US military also has different opinions and claims it is ""not a good idea right now."" This shows that the US is very divided internally.Global Times: Pelosi's visit to Taiwan is believed to have considerations of mid-term elections, trying to save some momentum for the Democratic Party. US domestic politics is increasingly overwhelming rational foreign relations. To what extent will domestic affairs of the US affect its actions regarding Taiwan?Zheng: Joe Biden and Pelosi share political interests in visiting Taiwan, as mid-term elections are coming. After Joe Biden came into power, the Democratic Party has made no achievements in internal affairs. Although Joe Biden has acted tough toward China and Russia diplomatically and reached some bipartisan consensus on the Taiwan question, these did not help him much. Joe Biden's approval rating is even lower than Donald Trump's. Donald Trump took the populist line and was not supported by elites. But when Joe Biden just took office, some Republican elites were optimistic about him. Now that Joe Biden's performance is sluggish, how should the Democratic Party deal with such a situation? Only by playing with diplomatic issues.Judging from the US' history, external conflicts and wars are usually effective ways to shift internal conflicts. External enemies are an important condition for internal unity. In the context of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, the US did not focus on Russia and Ukraine, but the Indo-Pacific, and its imaginary enemy is China.Global Times: If Pelosi really pays a visit to Taiwan, what does it mean for the situation in the Taiwan Straits? What short-term and long-term impact will it have on China-US relations? To what extent can China-US relations be the worst?Zheng: Pelosi's visit to Taiwan would constitute a US misjudgment of China. The Russia-Ukraine conflict has shown this. The US worries that its democracy is weakened and China's so-called autocracy will become stronger, which will lead to China's expansionism, especially prompting China to resolve the Taiwan question. Therefore, since the Russia-Ukraine conflict started, the US attention did not completely shift to EU. Instead, it did not forget Asia, especially Taiwan, and has continued to hype up the Taiwan question. The US' misjudgment is that it believes China will resolve the Taiwan question when the US is politically weak. The US wants to bluff to its Asia-Pacific allies and Taiwan to show that US will not forget their interests, even when it is weak itself. If China acts tough, the US will think its judgment is correct. If China behaves in a weak way, it will also be beneficial to the US.If a conflict does occur, the US can use this opportunity to promote an Asia version of NATO, which has become clearer as a direction for the US. Therefore, Pelosi's visit to Taiwan is not just a matter of midterm elections or a whim. On the Taiwan question, the US has no bottom line. There will be a bottom line, but not through paperwork or lip service, but fight.Like I said, there will be a bottom line only through fight. When there is a bottom line, there will be cooperation. Without a bottom line, China and the US will head toward conflict. Cooperation, competition and confrontation coexist in the US' China policy. Now the climate issue has become the ballast of China-US relations after trade and economics. We should emphasize healthy competition. China has proposed the Belt and Road Initiative, and the US has also launched some infrastructure construction projects. China should make it clear that it supports all actions conductive to local economic and social development.The US has claimed that there should be guardrails for China-US relations. China State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi said the three Sino-US joint communiqués are the most reliable guardrails for the two countries. But this is not enough for the US anymore. For a major power like the US, it views itself as law and rules that itself does not have to obey. Therefore, we need to fight for the right to make rules.

Zheng Yongnian Photo:Courtesy of Zheng Global Times: If Pelosi really visits Taiwan, what countermeasures can China take?Zheng: Pelosi will visit Taiwan if China does not exert strong pressure. China should not have any illusions, but should take real actions. China has earlier announced that the ""middle line"" is a non-existent line that some on the island wishfully think divides the Taiwan Straits into the mainland side and Taiwan. Now we may take a step further and send military aircraft to accompany Pelosi's plane into the island of Taiwan and conduct military exercises at the same time. China must fight resolutely, but avoid open conflict. This is our bottom line. We must exert maximum pressure to show our resolution of doing whatever it takes to realize national reunification. Taiwan is at the heart of China's core interests.Why is the US eager to do this right now? Because time is on our side, especially considering the development of China's military modernization. The US feels that if it does not do this now, there will be no hope in the future. Meanwhile, with the development of our military and economy, the reunification is inevitable.China should unveil the US' intensions. The US government wants to use the Taiwan question to cover up its internal contradictions. Playing the Taiwan card cannot save the US' interests. The US has kept saying that it wants to protect Taiwan's so-called democracy and freedom, but it wants to turn Taiwan into another Ukraine. This will only lead Taiwan to a dead end.Global Times: Military exercises or sending warplanes around Taiwan seems not enough to prevent the US and DPP authorities from colluding in salami-slicing tactics. What else could we do?Zheng: Reunification by force is the most effective way to prevent Taiwan secessionism. But the approach of reunification is open. There can be different versions of ""one country, two systems"" in Hong Kong, Macao or even Taiwan. When China's military level is beyond a certain level, it can neutralize the US' intervention. National reunification requires sticks and carrots. The US is a paradox. We should not underestimate the US' irrationality. We need to prepare for conflicts, as well as ways to contain conflicts.Global Times: The US' adherence to the ""one-China policy"" and its non-support for Taiwan secessionism are the foundation of China-US relations. Now the US wants to undermine this foundation to contain China. Does this reflect that the previous US cards to contain China do not work? Will the US government continue its trial and error in its China policy?Zheng: From Barack Obama's pivot to Asia, to Donald Trump's Indo-Pacific Strategy, then to Joe Biden, the US has tried everything. Technology blockade and decoupling have resulted in the US' high level of inflation. The US has tried many things and has reached no effective results. In the end, it can only play the Taiwan card. In the future, the US government will continue its trial and error in China policy.The US has become the most powerful country after World War II, which is because it is the end consumer market for almost all West countries. But the US now adopts trade protectionism and many policies are not working. The US policy regarding the China Sea has also failed. If we view China-US relations from this dynamic, we have reasons to be optimistic.",OPINION,VIEWPOINT,Photo: China military,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'China': ('LOC', 4), 'Taiwan': ('LOC', 6), 'Taiwan Straits': ('LOC', 7), 'US': ('LOC', 10), 'Russia': ('LOC', 1), 'US House': ('ORG', 2), 'China University of Hong Kong': ('ORG', 1), 'Shenzhen': ('ORG', 1), 'Institute for International Affairs': ('ORG', 1), 'Qianhai': ('ORG', 1), 'Global Times': ('ORG', 4), 'Congress': ('ORG', 1), 'Party': ('ORG', 2), 'Nancy Pelosi': ('PER', 6), 'Zheng Yongnian': ('PER', 4), 'Wang Wenwen': ('PER', 1), 'Joe Biden': ('PER', 3), 'Joe B': ('PER', 4), 'Psi': ('PER', 1), 'Donald Trump': ('PER', 2), 'Times': ('MISC', 2), 'COD': ('MISC', 1), 'Democratic': ('MISC', 2)}"
140,"Having learned nothing from Afghanistan, the US is repeating its mistakes in Ukraine",Nebojsa Malic,2022-07-25,"US is pouring money into Ukraine, both in terms of weapons and ammunition and economic assistance. The $40 billion authorized by the US Congress in May is a sizeable sum, especially for a country dealing with record-high inflation and national debt that has spiraled out of control.None of that seems to matter for the White House, which has pledged to back Ukraine with as much as they've got, for ""as long as it takes."" The very future of the ""liberal world order"" depends on Kiev's victory, declare armchair pundits on Twitter and echoed by hawkish members of Congress.The idea, outlined by everyone from President Joe Biden on down, is that West economic sanctions will crash the Russia economy while Moscow's military will be bled dry fighting the West-trained and -equipped Ukrainians. A keen observer of US's political scene will easily recognize the source of this strategy: a conviction by the US establishment that the Soviet Union was brought down by the one-two punch of the war in Afghanistan and military expenditures to match the West in a global arms race. This version of the West's Cold War ""victory"" is not even up for debate in the US, it's simply taken for granted.On Friday, the White House announced the dispatch of $270 million worth of military aid, including more HIMARS rocket artillery launchers and ""Phoenix Ghost"" suicide drones, the latest ""miracle weapons"" that are supposed to achieve victory for Ukraine. Such labels were previously bestowed on Javelin anti-tank missiles and Stinger anti-aircraft launchers, sent to Ukraine in February and March. The Stingers had this reputation carry over from Afghanistan, where the US provided them to Islamic militants fighting against the Soviets. While the US strategy for arming the Ukrainians seems partly based on the ""logic"" of arming the Afghan mujahedin in the 1980s, the way US's gradual increase of funding to the operations of the government in Kiev is more reminiscent of another Afghan adventure - US's own 20-year occupation, which ended ignominiously last year.Since the US public seems to have forgotten all about it, perhaps a reminder is in order.The US sent troops to Afghanistan in October 2001, shortly after the 9/11 terrorist attacks. What was supposed to be a quick war of vengeance turned into a 20-year open wound on the US budget. The Taliban was ousted quickly, but it took a decade to track down and kill Bin Laden - in nearby Pakistan. Even then, the US would not declare victory and go home, as the Taliban were on the rise again in response to the US occupation. In the never-ending struggle to defeat the insurgency, the government in Kabul had most of its budget funded by the US and its allies, while the Pentagon paid the salaries and weapons expenses of the ""Afghan National Army.""On July 8 last year, Joe Biden told US that the last US troops would leave Afghanistan by the end of August 2021. When asked if the Taliban takeover was inevitable, he famously replied, ""No, it is not,"" insisting that the Afghan Army is as well-equipped as any army in the world.""Within a month of Joe Biden's defiant statement, the Taliban were at the gates of Kabul and the Pentagon was leaking to major US media outlets that the Afghan capital could fall in 30-90 days. In reality, it took only five. On August 15, the Afghan government melted away and Taliban took control of Kabul virtually unopposed. The original plan to calmly fly US diplomats and civilians out of the country turned into a mad scramble. Images of men clinging onto the departing planes, falling off to their doom, made rounds on social media. The Pentagon sent thousands of US Marines to secure the airport - not from the Taliban, but from the human tide of Afghans seeking to escape. In the end, some 110,000 people were evacuated, but thousands of actual army translators and civilian contractors were left behind. The last US plane took off from Kabul just before midnight on August 30, 2021. In a speech on the following day, Joe Biden called the airlift an ""extraordinary success"" and said it was the end of US attempts to ""remake other countries"". From now on, he said, US will ""set missions with clear, achievable goals, and stay focused on fundamental national interests.Less than six months later, the very same Joe Biden would be mobilizing US allies for a confrontation with nuclear-armed Russia, while writing blank checks to Kiev!  As of July 22 this year, the Joe Biden White House has sent $8.2 billion worth of weapons to Ukraine. In May, around the time when the US Congress approved a $40 billion Ukraine aid bill, the Pentagon quietly admitted that some $7.1 billion worth of US weapons and equipment sent to Afghanistan had been left behind in Taliban hands.The author is a Serbia-US journalist. opinion@globaltimes.com.cn",OPINION,VIEWPOINT,Ukraine Afghanistan Illustration: Chen Xia/GT,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'US': ('LOC', 12), 'Ukraine': ('LOC', 4), 'White House': ('LOC', 2), 'Kiev': ('LOC', 2), 'Russia': ('LOC', 1), 'Moscow': ('LOC', 1), 'Soviet Union': ('LOC', 1), 'Afghanistan': ('LOC', 3), 'Congress': ('ORG', 2), 'Joe Biden': ('PER', 1), 'West': ('MISC', 4), 'Ukrainian': ('MISC', 2), 'Cold War': ('MISC', 1), 'HIMARS': ('MISC', 1), 'Phoenix Ghost': ('MISC', 1), 'Javelin': ('MISC', 1), 'Stinger': ('MISC', 1), 'Stingers': ('MISC', 1), 'Islamic': ('MISC', 1), 'Soviets': ('MISC', 1), 'Afghan': ('MISC', 2), 'Taliban': ('MISC', 1)}"

The tour is scheduled to include Ethiopia, Uganda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.Following his talks with Sisi, Lavrov held a meeting with his Egypt counterpart Sameh Shoukry at the Egypt Foreign Ministry's headquarters in Cairo.The Russia top diplomat said he had ""a constructive dialogue"" with the Egypt president and later with his Egypt counterpart, expressing Russia's appreciation for the fast-growing relations between the two countries.Speaking to a joint press conference after meeting with Shoukry, Lavrov lauded the expanding economic cooperation and growing trade volume between Russia and Egypt.He added that Russia and Egypt have shared views on many regional and global issues, including the Palestine-Israel conflict and the crises in Syria, Libya and Iraq.As for a global food shortage resulting from the Russia-­Ukraine conflict, Lavrov blamed the West sanctions for obstructing Russia grain exports, noting that Russia and Ukraine recently signed an agreement to help relieve the food crisis through safe corridors in the Black Sea for grain exports.Lavrov noted that his tour in Africa also seeks to discuss preparations for the second Russia-Africa summit that is scheduled for mid-2023.For his part, the Egypt foreign minister reiterated the need to reach ""a political and diplomatic settlement"" of the Russia-Ukraine crisis.""Lavrov's scheduled visit to Ethiopia after Egypt could be a message from Moscow that Russia can play an important role in solving the region's issues, the foremost of which is the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam crisis,"" Ahmed Kandil, head of the ­International Studies Unit at Cairo-based Al-Ahram Center for Political and Strategic ­Studies, told Xinhua, referring to the dispute between Cairo and Addis Ababa on the rules of filling and operating the dam built on their shared Nile River.",WORLD,CROSS-BORDERS,Picture description not found,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'Egypt': ('LOC', 14), 'Russia': ('LOC', 15), 'Cairo': ('LOC', 3), 'Moscow': ('LOC', 1), 'El - Dabaa': ('LOC', 1), 'Suez Canal': ('LOC', 1), 'Ukraine': ('LOC', 4), 'Africa': ('LOC', 3), 'Ethiopia': ('LOC', 1), 'Uganda': ('LOC', 1), 'Democratic Republic of the Congo': ('LOC', 1), 'Palestine': ('LOC', 1), 'Israel': ('LOC', 1), 'Syria': ('LOC', 1), 'Libya': ('LOC', 1), 'Iraq': ('LOC', 1), 'West': ('LOC', 1), 'Black Sea': ('LOC', 1), 'Abdel - Fattah al - Sisi': ('PER', 4), 'Sergey Lavrov': ('PER', 5), 'Vladimir Putin': ('PER', 1), 'Sameh Shoukry': ('PER', 2), 'La': ('PER', 2), 'Ministry': ('ORG', 1)}"

143,"With euro plunging against US dollar, Europe is pushed to the cliff",Wen Sheng,2022-07-24,"Ever since its inception in 1999 following the signing of the Maastricht Treaty, the foundation document for the EU, the euro, as the common currency used by all EU countries, has ricocheted against the US dollar in value. As the second most used international currency and once seen gaining popularity and importance, the euro has never ceased to be compared with the dollar. Correspondingly, politicians in the US, concerned about the rise of the euro, have tacitly placed the euro in the crosshairs in order to defend and safeguard the dollar's role as the world's prime reserve currency in the international economic system and to prolong US hegemony.Now, with the skyrocketing inflation, an energy crisis and exchange rate plunge, the Eurozone's economic outlook is becoming dimmer and increasingly uncertain. Put in another way, the EU has been pushed closer to the precipice. The euro fell below parity against the dollar on July 13, hitting a 20-year low. Bearing the long-cherished wishes of many EU countries, the currency was born with the faith to lead EU toward closer financial, economic and political bond through monetary integration. However, a plunge of COVID-19 percent in value against the dollar in the past 12 months, plus an impending recession across the Eurozone, seems to drive EU into a precarious gully. The euro supporters in the first place believe that the common currency-led EU integration will reduce the risk of crisis, conflicts and wars, allowing EU countries to resolve their problems through peaceful means. But, what the world is seeing today in EU is precisely the opposite. There exists an undercurrent force that drives against EU integration ever since the first day of the euro's birth, and the major pusher of that force is the US.The euro has experienced several sharp falls in the past six months. Due to the US-led NATO's stubborn eastward territory expansion, Moscow felt is national security was endangered and the Russia-Ukraine military conflict erupted on February 24. After the escalation of that crisis, tens of billions of dollars of capital has fled EU and flowed into the US. Then, politicians in US, knowing perfectly well the ""lethal point"" of EU, came out with a Donald Trump card, provoking the EU countries to embargo Russia produced oil and gas. The sanctions-induced energy crisis, most severely felt in the EU countries, has unleashed heavy structural damage on the EU economy, and it hit the euro hard. It remains unknown whether Moscow, furious and indignant against the US-led sweeping economic sanctions, retaliates and moves to block natural gas supply to EU through the North Stream 1 in coming winter.That damage is most felt in Germany, EU's leading economy. As a traditional industrial power, Germany has always maintained a trade surplus by exporting automobiles, machinery products, medicine and others valued added items. But the country experienced its first trade deficit in more than 30 years in May this year. The reason behind the deficit is the elevated energy prices that cut dearly into the country's industrial profit margins. Simply put, the rise in export commodity prices cannot keep up with the rise in energy prices. About one-third of Germany workers are working in export-oriented enterprises, so it is not hard to imagine the escalating pressure on the country. Germany's current predicament has undoubtedly cast a heavy shadow over the overall EU economy. The energy crisis is increasingly chipping away at the future of the EU. The Eurozone originally intended to promote digital and green transformation, but now, their worsening fiscal coffers are forcing the EU countries to focus on energy subsidies, which will inevitably dent the competitiveness of EU in the coming months and years. Facing surging inflation, the EU Central Bank was forced to raise interest rates, which will put more pressure on an already weak EU economy. Growing interest rates will increase borrowing costs across the Eurozone which will undoubtedly be a catastrophic blow for some highly indebted countries in the bloc. For example, Italy's debt to GDP ratio now exceeds 150 percent, and the rising interest rates will proportionately hike the risk of a debt default in the country. Since the inception of the euro, whenever the development of the currency looks rosy, including being embraced by more central banks across the world, the US has always come out and assaulted the euro. No matter it was using financial tools or directly provoking a hot war in EU, the purpose of US was to undermine EU unity and weaken EU economic integration. The US knows how to squeeze a rival and sustain its globally dominating dollar. In 1999, promoted by the US, NATO bypassed the UN and illegally launched an air strike against the former Yugoslavia under the pretext of ""averting a humanitarian disaster"" there. As the war broke out, the market responded with the euro falling sharply against the greenback. Currently, with the EU economies only recently emerging from a bruising coronavirus pandemic onslaught, the US, using the hands of NATO, provoked another hot conflict in the center of EU. US has vowed to weaken Russia in public, but there is another untold boogeyman - hitting the EU economy and defeating the euro.  A deteriorating and weakened EU is not in China's interest, and is never what China aspires to see. Three major China airlines' latest move to buy 292 Airbus planes and Beijing's move to reduce its total holdings of US Treasury bonds this year could be considered as a boon to EU and the euro. China does not want to see Russia weakened, either. After all, a multipolar world is more stable and secure than one gripped by a single superpower. The author is an editor with the Global Times. bizopinion@globaltimes.com.cn",SOURCE,ECONOMY,Illustration: Chen Xia/Global Times,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'Maastricht Treaty': ('MISC', 1), 'EU': ('ORG', 14), 'Eurozone': ('ORG', 2), 'NATO': ('ORG', 1), 'US': ('LOC', 7), 'Moscow': ('LOC', 1), 'Russia': ('LOC', 2), 'Ukraine': ('LOC', 1), 'Donald Trump': ('PER', 1)}"
144,Turf wars stall Ireland’s green agenda amid global climate crisis,AFP,2022-07-24,"In the aftermath of the hottest day in Ireland for more than 130 years last week, small family groups picked their way across the Bog of Allen in the country's midlands collecting sun-dried turf.The briquettes of peat, which are liquorice black when hewn wet from the ground, had turned a toasted brown in the soaring July temperatures and were ready to be stored and burnt as winter fuel.But the bog, like others across Ireland, has become a frontline in a struggle to cut carbon emissions and conserve peat lands, pitting rural communities against urban policy makers.""There's very deep anger and resentment that the likes of the Green Party and urban members of the Green Party think... they can run riot over the country people of Ireland,"" John Dore, a spokesperson for the Kildare Turf Cutters Association, told Agence France-Presse.Fourteen percent of the Irish population use turf, a smoky fuel, to heat their homes, according to Ireland's Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).For those who rely on the traditional energy source, which has been cut and burnt in the country for centuries, turf is a birthright.""It's a very cultural and community activity,"" Dore explained.

It's about being independent as well.""During a visit to Japan on Tuesday, Ireland's Prime Minister Micheal Martin said his government needed to focus on emissions as it looks to set legally binding targets by the end of the month.""I think what the heat waves are showing, it's bringing it home to people the enormity of the consequences of climate change,"" he told reporters in Tokyo. ""It's here now.""'Back to the bog'EPA figures released on Thursday showed a 4.7 percent rise in greenhouse gas emissions in 2021 compared with 2020 - and up 1.1 percent on 2019 pre-pandemic levels.Martin's three-party governing coalition, which includes Ireland's Greens, has been licking its wounds after it tried to place curbs on the sale of turf earlier this year.A series of heated debates on the restrictions triggered a rebellion among the government's rural deputies.One independent lawmaker from Tipperary, Mattie McGrath, said ministers needed a ""trip back to the bog"" to realize the impact of proposed restrictions on low-income families living in rural areas.As he unveiled revised plans to curb the retail sale of turf in the week before last, Green Party Environment Minister Eamon Ryan said controversial measures restricting the sale of turf to within communities of less than 500 people had been dropped.Under the new rules, sales of turf to family, friends and neighbors will continue as before. But sales at retail outlets and online will be banned, along with the advertisement of turf sales in traditional media.

147,Trade cooperation to top agenda during Indonesian president's China visit,Zhang Changyue,2022-07-21," At the invitation of China President Xi Jinping, Indonesian President Joko Widodo will visit China from July 25 to 26 and will have talks with Xi Jinping and China Premier Li Keqiang, said the China Foreign Ministry on Thursday. China and Indonesia attach high importance to the bilateral ties, as President Joko Widodo is the first foreign head of state to visit China after the Beijing Winter Olympic Games, and China will be the first stop on his first trip to East Asia since the onset of COVID-19, said China Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin at a routine press conference on Thursday.Widodo's upcoming visit is of great significance, as there have been no visits between the two countries' leaders for almost three years due to COVID-19 epidemic, said Tang Qifang, an associate research fellow at the China Institute of International Studies.Tang told the Global Times on Thursday that Joko's visit will not only boost trade and economic cooperation at the China-Indonesia bilateral level and at the China-ASEAN regional level, but also promote peace and stability at the global level given the current challenges the world faces.Commenting on China's expectations of Widodo's visit, Wang noted that China looks forward to further deepening strategic mutual trust and practical cooperation with Indonesia during Widodo's visit. ""China and Indonesia share extensive common interests and broad cooperation space, and we can set a good example of the mutual benefits and common development between developing countries,"" said Wang.""Economic and trade cooperation will be the most important topic during the two countries' talks. It is also the topic where both sides are most likely to make practical achievements because such cooperation is urgently needed to promote bilateral and regional economic recovery,"" Tang pointed out. Tang said that despite the momentum of China-Indonesia cooperation being quite strong, as the bilateral trade volume has increased amid the impact of COVID-19, Indonesia is still under pressure from the rising prices of international staple commodities and domestic inflation, and thus wants to improve its cooperation with China to maintain that positive trend and create more growth points.According to China's Ministry of Commerce, the China-Indonesia trade volume increased by 30.8 percent to $32.75 billion from January to March in 2022 compared with the same period last year.Also, spokesperson Wang said that President Joko will have a face-to-face conversation with the China leaders over the G20 Summit to be held from November 15 to 16 in Bali, Indonesia, to respond to pressing global challenges, demonstrate solidarity and coordination among major developing countries to inject more positive energy to the post-COVID-19 global economy.China firmly supports Indonesia, which holds the rotating G20 presidency in 2022, to play a constructive role in promoting global equality and justice, Wang said.Tang noted that playing a constructive role in the G20 presidency means coordinating other countries to preserve peace and stability amid the complicated international landscape, including the Ukraine crisis and tensions between China and the US.""Widodo's visit to China shows the firm attitude of Southeast Asia countries represented by Indonesia in refusing to be roped in by the US to contain China, and instead holding a neutral and balanced position between China and the US,"" Tang said.",CHINA,DIPLOMACY,China Indonesia Photo:VCG,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'China': ('LOC', 18), 'Indonesia': ('LOC', 7), 'East Asia': ('LOC', 1), 'Xi Jinping': ('PER', 2), 'Joko Widodo': ('PER', 6), 'Li Keqiang': ('PER', 1), 'Wang Wenbin': ('PER', 4), 'Tang Qifang': ('PER', 4), 'Jo': ('PER', 1), 'Indonesian': ('MISC', 1), 'Beijing Winter Olympic Games': ('MISC', 1), 'COVID - 19': ('MISC', 2), 'ASEAN': ('MISC', 1), 'Foreign Ministry': ('ORG', 2), 'China Institute of International Studies': ('ORG', 1), 'Global Times': ('ORG', 1)}"
148,China's message of warning 'received' as Pentagon opposes Pelosi's planned Taiwan visit,Zhang Hui,2022-07-22,"After China warned of ""strong and resolute measures"" over US House speaker Nancy Pelosi's planned Taiwan trip, US President Joe Biden on Wednesday hinted the Pentagon opposed Pelosi's trip. China observers believe that Joe Biden administration has clearly received China's message about a possible diplomatic and military response, which could be something the US is not able to afford. Amid risks of aggravating ties with China and a 40-year high inflation, the Joe Biden administration urgently needs to seek high-level engagement with China, but China observers warn that Joe Biden may use this engagement to trade for China's compromise in future bilateral trade arrangements or China's stance on Russia-Ukraine conflict, not out of intention to sincerely correct its mistakes, and China does not buy such a trick. When asked whether it's a good idea for Pelosi to visit Taiwan this summer, Joe Biden said ""The military thinks it's not a good idea right now, but I don't know what the status of it is.""In response to Joe Biden's latest remarks, Wang Wenbin, spokesperson of the China Foreign Ministry, said at media briefing Thursday that if Pelosi visits Taiwan, it would seriously violate the one-China principle and harm China's sovereignty and territorial integrity and the political foundation of China-US relations.  ""If the US insists on going its own way, China will take strong countermeasures. We mean what we say,"" Wang stressed.US lawmakers have been trying to recklessly push forward the agenda of restoring ""official relations"" with Taiwan authorities, either for personal political gains or for the need to salvage the Democratic Party, which is facing headwinds in the midterm elections, the US government needs to be more careful on that, as it has to consider the overall national interests and strategy, Yang Xiyu, a senior research fellow at the China Institute of International Studies, told the Global Times. He said Joe Biden may share the same concerns with the military on Pelosi's planned trip, as US government knew Pelosi's planned visit was playing with fire and it could seriously aggravate the cross-Straits tension, possibly triggering a China military response. As Joe Biden said that the US military thinks ""It's not a good idea,"" then it means he has consulted the case with the Pentagon, Lü Xiang, an expert on US studies at the China Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times on Thursday. Joe Biden's remarks also suggest that Pelosi and her colleagues had already made plans to visit Taiwan, despite the speaker's office has neither confirmed nor denied the schedule, Lü said. ""I believe the US side has already received the message from China about the possibility of extremely drastic diplomatic and military measures against the US, and the US cannot afford to face such a response"" the expert said. According to Lü, the US Department of Defense generally doesn't clearly states whether a trip is to be made or not, they usually make a list of possible scenarios and weigh the risks and costs for a visit like Pelosi's. ""Joe Biden's reaction suggested that the conclusion from military is very likely definitive and it will amount to cancelling Pelosi's trip.""Pelosi's office also told the US Post on Thursday that ""We do not confirm or deny international travel in advance due to long-standing security protocols.""Lü said he believes that Pelosi's office may eventually deny Pelosi's plan of visiting the island based on the shaky response.

US President Joe Biden, who is fully vaccinated and received two boosters, tested positive for COVID-19 on July 21, 2022, and was ""experiencing very mild symptoms,"" according to the White House.

Photo: AFPHigh-level talk? With or without Pelosi's visit, China-US relations are likely to experience a continued decline partially because a series of new anti-China bills and policies are about to be introduced in the US, analysts said, noting the escalating tensions of bilateral ties will greatly hurt the US, while there have been plenty of calls for Joe Biden to improve China-US relations and remove tariffs. Former US secretary of state Henry Kissinger in an interview on Tuesday warned Joe Biden against ""endless confrontation"" with China. According to Reuters, importers of technology products from China paid over $32 billion worth of tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump between mid-2018 to the end of 2021, and Ed Brzytwa, the Consumer Technology Association's vice president of international trade, said in a statement that the tariffs were hurting US businesses, not solving China trade challenges.Amid extreme difficulties at home and abroad, and especially given the new low of his public approval rate, which casts a shadow on the Democratic Party's midterm elections, Joe Biden has an urgent need to stabilize relations with China, and that's why he proposed again to talk to the China leader, analysts said. Joe Biden said on Wednesday that he expected to talk to China President Xi Jinping within the next 10 days, but he dodged the question of whether he would address tariffs during the proposed talks. However, Yang warned that even if the talks happen, Joe Biden might turn the high-level talks, a platform to lead bilateral relations, into a tool for its China policy, and China will not buy the tactic. Removing tariffs on imported China goods will strip 1 percent off inflation in the US over time which could help Joe Biden at the ballot box, former US ambassador David Adelman told CNBC in June. The US has been talking its own game on tariffs cut and they may also want to trade tariff cut for a shift in China's neutral stance on the Russia-Ukraine conflict, but China won't do this deal, Lü said. China also won't buy it if the 79-year-old Joe Biden seeks to use the 82-year-old Pelosi as a bargaining chip, Lü said.Diao Daming, an associate professor at the Renmin University of China in Beijing also warned that for now the US is more likely to be tweaking the tariffs to its own advantage than fully correcting its mistakes.Despite Joe Biden sidestepped the tariff question, analysts said the US should remove tariffs on China as it harms others without benefiting oneself. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has recently called for eliminating some of those tariffs as a way to ease domestic inflation, AP reported.Tensions to escalate Although the US' midterm elections focus more on domestic issues, such as inflation, Democrats may try to attract attention and support from voters using some extreme diplomatic moves, such as Pelosi's visit, Yang said. Both the US government and the Congress, from the perspective of policy implementation and legislation, will intensify the exploitation of the Taiwan question before the midterm elections, and more lawmakers may make some eye-catching moves such as visiting the island or supporting some bills out of political interest, analysts warned. And it's likely the US may move to further gradually upgrade relations with Taiwan authorities, Yang said. Lü warned that with enhanced provocations from the US, China should be prepared to see China-US relations change at anytime, including some changes that could take place overnight. Lü said it is likely that incidents worse than the 2001 midair collision involving a US plane and a China fighter jet near Hainan Province may take place in the future, but China will have to make sure that the consequences of continuously provoking China are unbearable for the US. Speaking at the Aspen Security Forum in Colorado on Wednesday, China Ambassador to the US Qin Gang said that the Taiwan question is at the core of China-US relations, tensions have lately risen across the Taiwan Straits and the one-China principle is now under threat. In recent years, the Taiwan authorities refused to accept the one-China principle and pursued a ""gradual Taiwan independence"" with the help of the US, and the US has been distorting and hollowing out the one-China policy, Qin said, urging the US to work with China to firmly oppose and contain ""Taiwan independence.""",CHINA,DIPLOMACY,"US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi departs the White House in Washington DC following a signing event for a postal service reform act on April 6, 2022.

149,Japan slammed for seeking excuses for military expansion by hyping threats from neighbors in annual defense report,Wang Qi,2022-07-22,"China on Friday denounced Japan over its annual defense white paper, as it outlined China and other neighbors as ""threats"" in a bid to gain more domestic support to boost the defense budget and amend the pacifist constitution. China analysts said that Japan's aggressive, condemnatory and containing mentality toward China is stronger and more straightforward . Besides, the emphasis of the white paper on active attack capability also reflects the strengthening of the right in Japan politics.China is mentioned 51 times in the English version of the 28-page report while Russia appears 40 times. It viciously listed China's military development along with the Russia-Ukraine conflict while brazenly saying that ""deterrence is essential for both defending Japan and creating peace.""It described the China island of Taiwan as an ""extremely important partner,"" while smearing the China mainland for attempting to ""change the status quo by coercion in the China Sea and the China Sea,"" and the lack of transparency in defense policy and military affairs. On Friday, China Foreign Ministry spokesperson, Wang Wenbin, expressed strong opposition against the white paper which is ""vilifying China's national defense policy, normal military development and legitimate maritime activities, hyping up the so-called China threats and interfering in China's internal affairs on the Taiwan question.""China adheres to the path of peaceful development and pursues a national defense policy that is defensive in nature, Wang said. He noted that Japan, a country with a history of militarism and aggression, publicly announced in its white paper that it would revise its defense documents, increase its defense budget and develop counter-attack capabilities, raising concerns that Tokyo is moving further away from pacifism and ""exclusively defense-oriented policy.""  We urge Japan to immediately stop seeking excuses for its military expansion by playing up security threats from its neighbors, deeply reflect on its history of aggression, stick to the path of peaceful development and take concrete actions to win the trust of its Asia neighbors and the international community, Wang said. China's embassy in Japan responded saying on Friday that the 2022 white paper maintains a wrong position and negative tone, maliciously slanders and accuses China, grossly interfers in China's internal affairs and seriously violates the spirit of the four political documents between China and Japan. The biggest challenge to regional peace and stability is Japan's reckless right-wing provocations in the China Sea and its saber-rattling in the China Sea with the US and other allies, the embassy said. The South Korea Foreign Ministry on Friday also condemned Japan for its sovereignty claims over the South Korea's easternmost islets of Dokdo, called Takeshima by Japan. The white paper also criticized Russia's aggression against Ukraine in a new chapter on the Russia-Ukraine conflict. It also hyped China-Russia military cooperation, which could make for a direct impact on the security environment surrounding Japan.The white paper also highlights North Korea's missiles launch and further provocations, which pose grave and imminent threats to Tokyo's security. The current edition of the white paper contains more obvious, straightforward, aggressive and condemnatory references against China, Da Zhigang, Director of the Institute of Northeast Asia Studies at Heilongjiang Provincial Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times on Friday. It is also clear that Japan is targeting China, Russia and North Korea to justify increasing its defense budget and military capabilities, Da said. For example, the white paper mentioned long-range missiles and counterattack capabilities. It sets the stage for the year-end security review expected to call for the acquisition of longer-range missiles, according to Reuters.   In one of the biggest changes in recent years, Japan has moved beyond exclusively defense-oriented policy, Lü Yaodong,  research fellow with the Institute of Japan Studies under the China Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times on Friday. Japan began to seek the ability to pre-emptively destroy enemy missiles and expanded targets from North Korea to China and Russia, Lü said. The white paper clearly shows the Japan military priorities for the future cover an increased military spending and offensive capability that includes attacking critical infrastructure, Da said. Experts said Japan was relatively careful in when it comes to China and Russia in the previous white papers because it did not want to affect the business. However, Japan is becoming more straightforward, giving people a feeling that it would rather risk economic losses to strengthen its military.Lü highlighted the fact that conservative lawmakers who support amending article 9 of Japan's pacifist constitution now surpassed two-thirds of the seats in both houses of parliament, which meets the condition to initiate the a constitutional reform. ""The political shift to the right will be further intensified,"" he said. Although the Japan parliament has initially met the conditions, the government still needs to work on the integration of opinions, especially the general acceptance of the elite, Da said, adding that ""the white paper is a way to guide public opinion ahead of the constitutional amendment.""",CHINA,DIPLOMACY,"Protesters gather at Shiba Park to demonstrate against the upcoming US-Japan summit and the summit of the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (Quad), in Tokyo, Japan, May 22, 2022.

150,Unilateral sanctions are human rights violations in the 21st century: Sri Lankan scholar,Jayanath Colombage,2022-07-22,"Sri Lanka is a case study of how unilateral sanctions inflict suffering on ordinary people, even when they are not directly targeted.The world that we live in today has many challenges. COVID-19 pandemic has been followed by a downturn throughout the whole world. If your economy is robust enough, you may sustain this situation. But it is not the case for many small-sized or medium-sized economies. They do feel the crunch and the punch of COVID-19 pandemic. Sri Lanka mobilizes foreign exchange reserves through primary commodity exports, tourism and remittances - and all three sectors are heavily impacted during the COVID-19 pandemic. The situation has been made even worse due to the Ukraine-Russia conflict and unilateral sanctions imposed by the West against Russia. Although not a part of the conflict in any way, and not near the conflict zone, Sri Lanka is suffering from the impact of West sanctions against Russia which disrupted the global food supply chain. Major West powers are not trying to resolve this conflict. We learned in conflict resolution and conflict transformation that we have to remove the materials that can catch fire. Instead, the major West powers are adding fuel to the fire and are not trying to resolve this situation. This means the impact of it on the people of Ukraine, people of Russia, people of Sri Lanka is immense. We need to look at this economic sanction from the angle of human suffering. The Russia special military operation in Ukraine and the consequences of unilateral economic sanctions have resulted in rising oil and gas prices and gas scarcity. Wheat prices are also going up. This has had a huge impact on a country like Sri Lanka. When unilateral sanctions are used against a powerful country, there is no guarantee they will achieve their intended consequences. Why? Because that country will be robust enough and powerful enough to harden the stance, allowing it to survive, self-sustain up to a certain level, sustain production, industry, currency, gold reserves and other things. So, the economic sanctions do not really, as it has been claimed, show the intended result. Prior to the Russia-Ukraine conflict, the price of a barrel of oil was around $80, and now it went up to $120 per barrel. Who pays the difference between the prices before and after? We are a small country with a small economy. And this has resulted in almost a collapse of our economy, bringing a huge impact and suffering on the people of Sri Lanka. It might be asked, what about their basic rights, due to these unilateral sanctions against Russia? Let's look at the case of Xinjiang. When the US and the West imposed unilateral sanctions on Xinjiang, who is actually going to suffer? It is the ordinary people of Xinjiang because of these unilateral sanctions. I have been to Xinjiang. I have seen how people are trying to come out with their lives, I have seen how people want to do things and develop their economy and how kids want to restart their education. I have seen how young people are trying to learn life skills so that they can find suitable employment. The world needs to study the consequence of sanctions because they constitute a serious violation of human rights. Therefore, in the UN system and in the international system, it needs to be asked, what actually are human rights? A new definition is needed. Has it been weaponized? Has it been heavily politicized? These questions must be asked. And also, human rights are used for bashing some countries. We have heard that when the world is united, we can have a better voice and we don't like hegemonic powers. Unfortunately, we do not hear that voice sufficiently. The big powers still win. Their narrative still prevails. This is why a new approach to human rights is needed, which involves defining it again in the 21st century to include unilateral sanctions as a violation of human rights. There is an urgent need to depoliticize and deweaponize human rights in this world. In conclusion, there should be a long hard look given to unilateral sanctions and their consequences, not only on the targeted country, but also on the untargeted countries as well. The suffering of people because of these sanctions also needs to be mapped and shared with the world, if it is to become a better place to live.In that sense, hegemonic ambitions, weaponizing and politicizing human rights, and imposing unilateral sanctions are really, really bad. And these are major violations of human rights of large number of ordinary people. The world has to look at this problem very seriously.The author is a distinguished research Fellow of the Beijing-based Global Governance Institution. opinion@globaltime.com.cn",OPINION,VIEWPOINT,Illustration: Liu Rui/GT,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'Sri Lanka': ('LOC', 5), 'Ukraine': ('LOC', 4), 'Russia': ('LOC', 6), 'COVID - 19': ('MISC', 5), 'West': ('MISC', 4)}"

154,"Hyping ‘China threat,’ UK politicians as sensational and low-class as the country’s tabloids",Global Times,2022-07-22,"UK drama queens are on the move again. When Richard Moore, chief of MI6, the UK's secret intelligence service, said that China is a bigger threat than terrorism, he showed nothing but sensationalism and unprofessionalism. Addressing the Aspen Security Forum in Colorado on Thursday local time, Moore articulated that China was now the top intelligence priority for MI6, surpassing counter-terrorism. One of the excuses he gave is that China is watching the Ukraine crisis closely for lessons about how to achieve its goal in the Taiwan question. Moore's rhetoric reminds people of UK Foreign Secretary Elizabeth Truss, who laid bare her laughable ignorance of history and geography during a meeting with Russia Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, Shen Yi, a professor at the School of International Relations and Public Affairs of Fudan University, told the Global Times. When Moore put strategic competition and anti-terrorism together, he also makes professional analysts feel a sense of embarrassment. If MI6 were more professional, it wouldn't make a fuss about groundless speculation. If more UK politicians were more professional, they would be sober-minded about the fact that the biggest threat to the UK is its own development - and governance-related puzzles. Voices have been loud in Scotland and Northern Ireland to leave the UK for quite some time. If those issues are not fixed, social turmoil could emerge. Unfortunately, some UK politicians have delivered little professionalism on domestic challenges, but displayed great enthusiasm and skilled tactics in clamoring about geopolitics, or more specifically, playing the China card, like how UK tabloid newspapers attract eyeballs. The race to replace Boris Johnson as the UK's next prime minister has come to the final stage, as lawmakers from the Conservative Party have selected the final two candidates, former finance minister Rishi Sunak and Elizabeth Truss. The two front-runners represent the two forces within UK political circles - the relatively pragmatic side which advocates cooperation with China, and the typical hawkish side which views China as a rival and threat, Cui Hongjian, director of the Department of EU Studies at the China Institute of International Studies, told the Global Times. As the debates go on, Moore may have raised his voice to impose influence on the country's next leader and administration. Similar hype has become increasingly frequent lately in the UK. Two days before Moore's speech, Ben Key, in his first public address as UK First Sea Lord, said China is a more dangerous foe than Russia - of course, this is a convenient excuse to seek more funding from the incoming government.The trend is quite clear - some UK politicians are eager to grab the limelight by simply showcasing their hawkish stance against China, just like how the UK itself tries hard to prove its global status in the global arena.George Galloway, a six-term UK parliamentarian, said that ""when we act and express today the interference in China's internal affairs, we do so not on our own behalf, but on behalf of the US empire as the tail of the US dog."" Be it its participation in the AUKUS and Indo-Pacific Strategy, blatant finger-pointing on Hong Kong and Taiwan affairs, or more Anglo-Saxon alliance against China, the UK has shown it is ready to play its part on the command of the US. This is because the UK has never reconciled itself to its loss of empire and its decline in the world. To some extent, London has tied its yearning to regain its past glory to the US hegemon. In the Russia-Ukraine conflict, the UK has been charging to the forefront via high-profile support to Ukraine, including offering intelligence and weapons. Obviously, that is not enough for some UK politicians, who have found a new mission - fanning the flames in Asia by stirring up trouble on the Taiwan question. This is not supposed to be the real content of ""Global UK,"" is it? ""The UK won't go far by riding on the US' chariot, because the latter will fall from hegemony eventually,"" said Song Zhongping, a China military expert and TV commentator. If the UK wants to make a difference, it needs different politics and different politicians, who are serious about taking care of the country and its people's interests, rather than picking fights out of nowhere to grab attention, just like boring, low-class UK tabloids.",OPINION,VIEWPOINT,UK Illustration: Chen Xia/GT,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'UK': ('LOC', 12), 'China': ('LOC', 8), 'Colorado': ('LOC', 1), 'Ukraine': ('LOC', 1), 'Taiwan': ('LOC', 1), 'Russia': ('LOC', 1), 'Scotland': ('LOC', 1), 'Northern Ireland': ('LOC', 1), 'Richard Moore': ('PER', 6), 'Elizabeth Truss': ('PER', 2), 'Sergey Lavrov': ('PER', 1), 'Shen Yi': ('PER', 1), 'Boris Johnson': ('PER', 1), 'Rishi Sunak': ('PER', 1), 'MI6': ('ORG', 3), 'Aspen Security Forum': ('ORG', 1), 'School of International Relations and Public Affairs': ('ORG', 1), 'Fudan University': ('ORG', 1), 'Global Times': ('ORG', 2), 'Conservative Party': ('ORG', 1), 'C': ('ORG', 1), 'Hongji': ('ORG', 1), 'Department': ('ORG', 1), 'EU Studies': ('ORG', 1), 'Institute': ('ORG', 1), 'International Studies': ('ORG', 1), 'Ben Key': ('ORG', 1), 'First Sea': ('ORG', 1)}"
155,S.Korea attempts to assure China on supply chain amid US pressuring over exclusive ‘chip alliance’,GT staff reporters,2022-07-22,"South Korea faces a dilemma of whether to join the US-led semiconductor alliance ""Chip 4"" or not, as President Yoon Suk-yeol has called for ""active diplomacy"" with China to ensure there are no misunderstandings regarding its possible participation, the Yonhap News Agency reported.Yoon's prudence on the topic indicated South Korea's careful calculations over gains, if any, against losses from possible participation, as South Korea's export-centered economy would be hit hard if it blindly joins the US' technology choking-off of China, South Korea's largest trading partner, observers said. If South Korea blindly follows the US, its chip exports will suffer a huge blow, harming its $40- $50 billion chip trade per year with China, Han Xiaomin, general manager of Jiwei Insights in Beijing, told the Global Times on Friday. South Korea's chip trade with other countries is about $150 billion per year, and chip trade with China accounts for around 30 percent. Cooperation between China and South Korea in the field of chips is very close, and they are almost ""inseparable,"" Ma Jihua, a veteran technology analyst, told the Global Times on Friday.Ma said that South Korea is in the upstream in most fields, but now, some South Korea chip companies have a large number of manufacturers in China for production as well as research and development, and the chips used by some South Korea companies are also made in China. SK Hynix announced in May plans to build a new wafer manufacturing base in Dalian, Northeast China's Liaoning Province, further expanding its business in China after acquiring US chip giant Intel's assets in the region. The NAND flash memory chips made by Samsung Electronics' Xi Jinping'an factory account for more than 40 percent of its NAND flash memory output, while 45 percent of SK Hynix's total DRAM chip output is produced in Wuxi, China's Jiangsu Province, according to South Korea media outlets. Samsung's first-quarter fiscal report for 2022 showed the company's net revenue in China amounted to 10.46 trillion won ($7.98 billion), 13 percent of the total.""South Korea's and China's chip industries have become intertwined in the past 20 years, and it is almost impossible to separate the two bluntly,"" Ma said.

Photo: cnsphotoWho is behind?In March, the US proposed the idea of ""Chip 4"" and sent invitations to Japan, South Korea and China's Taiwan island. But four months later, South Korea has not yet given a clear answer. According to South Korea media, without negotiations and coordination in advance, the US unilaterally informed South Korea that it is scheduled to hold a meeting on the issue at the end of August.Adding to the pressure, US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen showed up in Seoul on Tuesday, claiming to end the US' ""undue dependence"" on rare earths, solar panels and other key goods from China, according to Reuters. Upholding the idea of ""US first,"" the US will definitely be the biggest beneficiary of such an alliance, while Japan and South Korea will be the victims, Ma said, citing precedents in history. Japan's semiconductor industry saw rapid development both in terms of design and manufacturing two decades ago, becoming a ""threat"" to the US' chip sector. The US then imposed several rounds of extra tariffs on Japan products, while giving South Korea preferences to develop its semiconductor industry.""Oppressing one country while supporting another is a typical practice of the US,"" Ma said.The biggest loss of Japan's chip industry was not earnings, but the opportunity to build a complete advanced industry chain, Ma said. ""Japan has a number of high-tech products, but no complete industry chain due to the US' activities,"" he noted.""Even if South Korea joins the US alliance, it will not be able to obtain any newer technology from the US, but will only be regarded as a tool to contain China,"" Ma said.""The US will have a bite of the China market, which once belonged to South Korea, if Seoul yields to US's pressuring,"" Wang Peng, a research fellow at the Beijing Academy of Social Sciences said.

Photo:XinhuaBigger pictureExperts said that soaring bilateral trade with China is another important reason for Yoon's hesitation, as South Korea attaches more importance to the China market, which is geographically closer than the US.China has been South Korea's largest trading partner for 18 consecutive years, and bilateral trade is roughly the same as that of South Korea with the US, Japan and the EU combined.In 2021, bilateral trade exceeded $360 billion, more than 60 times the level recorded 30 years ago when the two established diplomatic ties.China's Ministry of Commerce said on Thursday that China and South Korea have made substantial progress in second-phase China-South Korea Free Trade Agreement talks. The two sides have held nine rounds of formal negotiations. They have carried out negotiations on high-level liberalization of trade in services and investment through a negative list model, and the negotiations made substantial progress.Since the China-South Korea FTA was signed in 2015, the two sides have cut tariffs eight times, and China has eliminated tariffs on more than 40 percent of imported goods from South Korea. China and South Korea have achieved a high degree of complementarity over the past 30 years, and their industry and supply chains are deeply intertwined, China Ambassador to South Korea Xing Haiming said in a forum on Thursday, highlighting industrial cooperation.Market watchers said the South Korea economy has been hit hard by the global supply chain crisis, and how to boost its economy is also an important agenda for the government. The government has introduced policies to stabilize the supply chain, which have achieved certain results. However, the global supply chain situation has not seen a fundamental improvement this year. In addition, the outbreak of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine has put South Korea economy to another test. Also, a recent general strike in the South Korea freight sector has brought huge losses to the nation's industries and aggravated the supply chain crisis.Although China's semiconductor industry lags behind the US in terms of patents and behind South Korea in manufacturing, it hopes to leapfrog its rivals by adopting revolutionary new chip design techniques. Bloomberg reported on Friday that China's Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp (SMIC) has likely advanced its production technology by two generations, defying US sanctions intended to halt the rise of China's largest chipmaker.The Shanghai-based manufacturer is shipping bitcoin-mining semiconductors produced using 7-nanometer (nm) technology, industry watcher TechInsights wrote in a blog post on Tuesday. That's well ahead of SMIC's established 14nm technology. Exporting 7nm chips is a big advance for the country's chip industry, meaning that its chip manufacturing has broken the US blockade to some extent, Ma said. If the chips can be mass-produced, China will embark on a chip rise.",SOURCE,ECONOMY,chip Photo:VCG,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'South Korea': ('LOC', 12), 'US': ('LOC', 4), 'China': ('LOC', 11), 'Beijing': ('LOC', 1), 'Dalian': ('LOC', 1), 'Northeast China': ('LOC', 12), 'Liaoning Province': ('LOC', 1), 'Chip 4': ('MISC', 1), 'Yoon Suk': ('PER', 2), 'yeol': ('PER', 1), 'Han Xiaomin': ('PER', 1), 'Ma Jihua': ('PER', 2), 'Xi Jinping': ('PER', 1), 'Yonhap News Agency': ('ORG', 1), 'Jiwei Insights': ('ORG', 1), 'Global Times': ('ORG', 2), 'SK Hynix': ('ORG', 1), 'Intel': ('ORG', 1), 'Samsung Electronics': ('ORG', 2), 'SK Hix': ('ORG', 1), 'DR': ('ORG', 1), 'Wu': ('ORG', 1), 'Jiang': ('ORG', 1)}"
156,Will Britain’s Tories turn back time or vote for progress?,Mark Blacklock,2022-07-21," The political fiasco - the Conservative Party's leadership election - has entered its final phase in UK, after a couple of weeks of farcical early stages which exposed deep divisions among the nation's would-be political rulers.From an original field of 11 candidates, now there are just two: Foreign Secretary Elizabeth Truss and recently resigned chancellor of the exchequer, Rishi Sunak.Both are committed Tories, and both clearly on the right wing of the UK politics. But they have massive policy differences, some of which, in different ways, will be significant for China when one of them becomes the replacement prime minister for Boris Johnson, who has been forced out of office following a series of scandals surrounding his government.As far as China is concerned, there seems to be two possible outcomes: Elizabeth Truss the hawk, whose dogmatic attitudes toward China are, at best, confrontational, or Sunak, whose approach seems more nuanced and pragmatic. In this way, these elections will determine whether relations between London and Beijing will improve or worsen. For now, there is a kind of diplomatic interregnum in which nothing is likely to change until a new PM arrives and makes some serious policy decisions.The method by which candidates are chosen is Byzantine, but the choice between the final two candidates is made by the party's 160,000 members - 71 percent of whom are male, more than half are aged over 60, more than one-third are clustered in England's wealthier southeast, and who are notorious for holding reactionary views, being resistant to meaningful change. Given those demographics, Sunak's and Elizabeth Trusss public statements between now and the final vote in September seem unlikely to be sympathetic toward China.Elizabeth Truss is well known for her hostile statements toward China. She has called on the West to ""make sure that Taiwan has the ability to defend itself,"" and accused Beijing of breaking ""legally-binding commitments"" over Hong Kong. She has enthusiastically promoted of a ""network of liberty"" initiative to link countries with shared economic interests, if not values, and which is seen as part of a pushback against China with its Belt and Road Initiative. She ordered the withdrawal of UK judges from Hong Kong and backed the diplomatic boycott of the Winter Olympic Games. When she warned earlier this year that China could launch a war of aggression in the Indo-Pacific because of Russia's war in Ukraine, Australia's former premier Paul Keating said her comments were ""nothing short of demented. Not simply irrational - demented."" But she takes criticism often as confirmation of the correctness of her views. She is well-versed in all of the usual West anti-China talking points including Xinjiang, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and as predictably ill-informed. Interestingly, she was supposedly nicknamed the ""human hand grenade"" by Boris Johnson's chief advisor Dominic Cummings.The other contender, Sunak, has approached China - before he resigned - with an attitude of pragmatic engagement. It is still a long way from the years of the David Cameron premiership, when the then PM and his chancellor George Osborne spoke of a ""golden age"" of relations between the two countries. After an initial period of relative estrangement at the start of the Boris Johnson administration, the UK government has been more recently working toward a rapprochement with Beijing. Sunak has pushed to improve business relationships between the two countries and was behind the drive to reestablish the UK-China Economic and Financial Dialogue last year (though plans to begin discussions this month unraveled when Sunak, and later Boris Johnson, announced their resignations). Sunak has been critical of Beijing, and in February blamed China for pushing up global energy prices. Nevertheless, he as prime minister would be the politician most likely to adopt a realpolitik approach, if only to focus on attracting heavy investment in the UK from China - a sharp contrast with the right wing caucus forming around Elizabeth Truss.It is impossible to gauge accurately how the Tory membership will vote. The received wisdom of many observers is that Sunak appeals most to the UK electorate and would stand the most chance of winning any forthcoming general election. Elizabeth Truss, on the other hand, while less popular with the wider electorate, is thought to be hugely popular among the staid Conservative membership. Ironically, if she was elected leader - and therefore automatically became the next prime minister - it would probably increase the Tories' chances of losing the next general election, heralding almost certainly the return of a Labor government for the first time in more than a decade.Over the past few weeks, the ultra-conservative newspaper the Daily Mail - whose modest circulation of about 800,000 copies a day belies its disproportionate influence on the UK's political discourse - has been openly campaigning to get Elizabeth Truss chosen as party leader with blatantly positive stories about her and negative ones about other candidates - especially those who, like Sunak, most threaten her.On Wednesday, the newspaper confected a report based upon coverage of the party leadership elections in the Global Times. It characterized balanced reporting of the Global Times as being suspiciously sympathetic toward Sunak and therefore implying his disloyalty to UK. It was what UK journalists themselves might describe as a clumsy ""attack job,"" with obvious political motivations. The question to ask, however, is why did it do this?From the evidence so far it seems that the belligerents are in the ascendant and China may have its work cut out forming a harmonious relationship with the UK when the new prime minister takes over in September. The hawks would have US turn the clock back, instead of moving forward together. And, who knows, the Daily Mail might even see this article as proof of Sunak's ""traitorous"" tendencies.The author is a journalist and lecturer living in UK. opinion@globaltimes.com.cn",OPINION,VIEWPOINT,Photo: GT,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'Conservative Party': ('ORG', 1), 'UK': ('LOC', 3), 'China': ('LOC', 7), 'London': ('LOC', 1), 'Beijing': ('LOC', 2), 'England': ('LOC', 1), 'West': ('LOC', 1), 'Taiwan': ('LOC', 1), 'Hong Kong': ('LOC', 2), 'Belt': ('LOC', 1), 'Pacific': ('LOC', 1), 'Russia': ('LOC', 1), 'Ukraine': ('LOC', 1), 'Australia': ('LOC', 1), 'Elizabeth Truss': ('PER', 4), 'Rishi Sunak': ('PER', 3), 'Boris Johnson': ('PER', 1), 'Paul Ke': ('PER', 1), 'Tori': ('MISC', 1), 'Byzantine': ('MISC', 1), 'Olympic Games': ('MISC', 1), 'Indo': ('MISC', 1)}"
157,Britain needs more than just a change of personnel,Carlos Martinez,2022-07-21,"The political crisis in Westminster is symptomatic of a much deeper crisis of the UK capitalism. Widespread dissatisfaction with the UK government reflects a growing awareness among the public that living conditions are rapidly deteriorating.After rising slowly but consistently for 50 years from 1960 onward, life expectancy at birth has not increased in the last decade. Indeed due to excess deaths caused by COVID-19, compared with 2019, life expectancy in England in 2020 was 1.3 years lower for males and 0.9 years lower for females.The Financial Times reported recently that four in 10 UK households are struggling to pay their energy bills, which have increased dramatically in recent months. Inflation is currently running at 9 percent, its highest level in 40 years.As prices are going up, income is coming down. GDP has been falling throughout 2022 so far.Meanwhile UK is struggling to rebound from the blow it received from COVID-19. According to Johns Hopkins, over 181,000 people have lost their lives to the virus. Scaled up to China's population, this would be nearly 4 million people - a veritable tragedy.UK is suffering a human rights crisis which many thought was not possible in the 21st century. Statistics released in December 2021 indicated that at least 688 people died while homeless in England and Wales in 2020. And the crisis does not impact all social groups equally: Black children are twice as likely as their white counterparts to be growing up in poverty.This human rights crisis is the root of the governmental crisis, and it will not be solved by a simple change of occupancy at 10 Downing Street. The grim economic situation is the result of policies that have been pursued by the UK capitalism for the last decade and more.While some countries - notably China - responded to the global financial crisis of 2008 by increasing investment in infrastructure and responding to ordinary people's needs, UK responded with a program of neoliberal austerity, reducing expenditure on housing, education, healthcare, youth services and more.Since Brexit, the UK ruling class has deepened this program of neoliberalism, deregulating the economy, lowering taxes and reducing social spending in order to make UK more attractive to the US, with which UK is desperate to agree a free trade deal.Along with this program of economic self-harm, UK has essentially outsourced its foreign policy to US, going along with new cold war policies against China and Russia - policies that serve the interests of the US military-industrial complex but run directly counter to the interests of ordinary people in UK.The UK defence review of 2021, Global UK in a Competitive Age, defined China as ""the biggest state-based threat to the UK's economic security"" and announced that UK would ""tilt"" toward the Asia-Pacific region ―a curious decision, given that UK is on the opposite side of the world to the Pacific.In an alarming throwback to the days of the UK Empire, the UK joined with Australia and the US last year to form AUKUS - a trilateral security pact essentially aimed at creating a Pacific NATO. Connected to this, UK has sent its largest aircraft carrier, the HMS Queen Elizabeth, to the China Sea. On the economic front, UK has mandated the removal of Huawei technology from its 5G network infrastructure.UK has also joined the chorus of despicable slander over alleged human rights abuses in China's Xinjiang region, as well as wilfully violating China's sovereignty by offering BN(O)passports to hundreds of thousands of Hong Kong residents.Meanwhile, UK has been a leading ""hawk"" in relation to the Ukraine crisis, giving broad financial and military support to Kiev and campaigning for unprecedented sanctions against Moscow. These unilateral coercive measures are already having an adverse impact on the people of UK (and indeed large parts of the world), driving up prices of food, energy and fertilizer.In short, the UK government has subordinated the national interest to US elites which are intent on pursuing an aggressive and hegemonic strategy against China and Russia. This escalating global hybrid warfare is directed toward the Project for a New US Century - a project that will bring absolutely no benefits to the UK people.UK can overcome its economic and political crises only when it gives up on propping up US imperialism, and when it sets about defining UK's role in a multipolar world free of hegemonism. In such a world, UK could have extensive and mutually beneficial relations with China and Russia, as well as the other key emerging economies. Whoever leads the next government in Westminster, they would be well advised to develop a foreign and economic policy based on improving the living standards of the population. Unfortunately, the UK ruling class is near-unanimous in its opposition to such a shift toward sanity. If this shift is to occur, it will be the result of mass action by the millions of ordinary people that are bearing the brunt of the crisis.The author is a UK author and independent political commentator. opinion@globaltimes.com.cn",OPINION,VIEWPOINT,UK Illustration: Chen Xia/GT,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'Westminster': ('LOC', 1), 'UK': ('LOC', 11), 'England': ('LOC', 2), 'China': ('LOC', 3), 'Wales': ('LOC', 1), '10 Downing Street': ('LOC', 1), 'US': ('LOC', 2), 'Russia': ('LOC', 1), 'COD': ('MISC', 2), '19': ('MISC', 2), 'Black': ('MISC', 1), 'The Financial Times': ('ORG', 1), 'Johns Hopkins': ('ORG', 1)}"
158,A new angle is needed to observe today’s US,Jin Canrong,2022-07-21,"Given the situation in US domestic and foreign policy, rounds and rounds of discussions among academic and public opinion circles on whether the US' self-correction ability has failed and whether the US has declined, have been going on for some time. The fundamental issue behind the questions is how should observers understand today's US?The US is a superpower. Normally, for a major power, as long as there is no domestic chaos, its challenges from the outside are relatively controllable. But the current challenge for the US is that it faces a number of intensifying internal controversies.To begin with, the US is faced with conflicts among different social classes. This contradiction has always existed, but has been aggravating in recent years. In 2011, Occupy Wall Street, a protest movement against economic inequality and the influence of money in politics broke out. Its slogan was, ""We are the 99 percent,"" referring to income and wealth inequality in the US between the wealthiest 1 percent and the rest of the population. The movement came to an end in November 2011, but the contradiction has continued, leading to rising populism. The second is political polarization, or growing contradictions between the left and the right. In the past, both Democratic and Republican parties had strong moderate forces. But somehow the moderate forces have been waning over the years. The left-wing forces in the Democratic Party are keen to engage in identity politics and pin labels on others. In the Republican Party, populist right-wing forces have obtained the upper hand. This has made it increasingly harder for both sides to reach any compromise. The US is thus trapped in a vicious circle of ""veto politics,"" and has run out of governance capability. The third is racial contradictions and tensions between blacks and whites. After the civil rights movement in 1950s and 1960s, the problem has been alleviated over time, but it is rising again today with more complexities, such as growing discrimination against Asians. Whilst the above-mentioned problems are old issues for the US, there are also new headaches. The fourth is the contradiction between the real economy and the virtual economy. As internet economy has been growing several times faster than US real economy, divisions and contradictions have emerged among US capitalist groups. This has never happened in the US before. It means cracks are growing amongst US elites and the ruling class. The fifth is the contradiction between globalism and nativism. People in US coastal areas and capitalist groups support globalization, as they have strong bonds with the outside world and have gained benefits from it. But those living in inland tend to support nativism. Both old and new problems have made the US more complicated than ever before in modern times. Worse, the US lacks real politicians. There was a time when the US had Abraham Lincoln, Franklin Roosevelt, and other leaders with visions. But there is no one like them nowadays. There are numerous politicians, but they are mostly the puppets of different interests groups. The US once had a system that could correct its errors, but now, people are not sure whether they could still say so. Whether the US can once again demonstrate its resilience among all the puzzles depends on whether it can confront its problems, pool its resources and utilize strength to promote economic and technological development, slowing down its political infighting and bringing social contradictions under control. But it seems the US can hardly face up to its problems. The Joe Biden administration has kept blaming the Russia-Ukraine conflict for surging inflation, and blaming China for its domestic employment and broader economic problems. The fundamental logic of US is finding a scapegoat for its own failures, forcing others to take the medicine when itself is sick. Moreover, the US is not as strong as it used to be. Years after the attack on Pearl Harbor during the World War II, the US built a considerable number of aircraft carriers, destroyers and fighter jets. But now, as its virtual economy squeezes its real economy, the strength of the US no longer exists. The US is like an old man, who had his glorious days, but has lost its ability to correct his own errors. Against the backdrop, a simple tumble could be fatal. Granted, the US is still the superpower. But with all its contradictions, observers need to view the country with a new angle. The author is a professor at School of International Studies at the Renmin University of China. opinion@globaltimes.com.cn",OPINION,VIEWPOINT,Illustration: Chen Xia/GT,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'US': ('LOC', 14), 'Street': ('LOC', 1), 'Occupy': ('MISC', 1), 'Democratic': ('MISC', 1), 'Republican': ('MISC', 1), 'Asian': ('MISC', 1), 'Wall': ('ORG', 1), 'Democratic Party': ('ORG', 1), 'Republican Party': ('ORG', 1)}"
159,Draghi resigns as coalition falls,AFP,2022-07-21,"Italy Prime Minister Mario Draghi resigned Thursday after efforts to bring the country's fractious parties to heel failed, kicking off a snap election campaign which could bring the hard right to power.The internationally respected 74-year-old formally handed his resignation to President Sergio Mattarella, whose role it is to now guide the country out of the crisis.Mattarella is likely to dissolve parliament and call early elections for September or October, according to political analysts. Draghi may stay on as head of the government until then.""Italy betrayed,"" the Repubblica daily frontpage cried, while the Stampa ran with ""For Shame.""Based on current polls, a rightist alliance led by Giorgia Meloni's Brothers of Italy party would comfortably win a snap election.Draghi was parachuted into the premiership in 2021 as Italy wrestled with a pandemic and ailing economy.On Wednesday, he had attempted to save the government, urging his squabbling coalition to put aside their grievances for the sake of the country.""Are you ready?"" he asked the Senate four times. ""Now was not the time for uncertainty, amid a myriad of challenges, from a struggling economy and soaring inflation to the Ukraine war,"" he said.Three parties - Silvio Berlusconi's center-right Forza Italia, Matteo Salvini's anti-immigrant League and populist Five Star Movement - decided they were not. They opted to sit out the vote, saying it was no longer possible for them to work together.The crisis was sparked when Five Star snubbed a key vote last week, despite warnings from Draghi that it would fatally undermine the coalition.His downfall comes in spite of recent polls suggesting most Italians wanted Draghi to stay at the helm until the scheduled general election in May 2023.Anxious investors were watching closely as the coalition imploded.The spread - the difference between 10-year Italy and Germany treasury bonds - widened to 215 points by market close on Wednesday.Supporters of Draghi had warned a government collapse could worsen social ills in a period of rampant inflation, delay the budget, threaten EU post-pandemic recovery funds and send jittery markets into a tailspin.Laurence Boone, France's EU affairs minister, said Draghi's expected resignation would open a ""period of uncertainty"" and mark the loss of a ""pillar of EU.""The Brothers of Italy party, which has neo-fascist roots, is flying high in the polls - but it would need the support of ­Forza Italia and the League - and the three parties often clash.Should it win, such a coalition ""would offer a much more disruptive scenario for Italy and the EU"" than Draghi's national unity government, wrote Luigi Scazzieri, senior research fellow at the Centre for EU Reform.",WORLD,EUROPE,Picture description not found,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'Italy': ('LOC', 4), 'Ukraine': ('LOC', 1), 'Germany': ('LOC', 1), 'France': ('LOC', 1), 'Mario Draghi': ('PER', 5), 'Sergio Mattarella': ('PER', 2), 'Giorgia Meloni': ('PER', 1), 'Silvio Berlusconi': ('PER', 1), 'Matteo Salvini': ('PER', 1), 'Dr': ('PER', 2), 'Laurence Boone': ('PER', 1), 'Repubblica': ('ORG', 1), 'Stampa': ('ORG', 1), 'Brothers of Italy': ('ORG', 1), 'Senate': ('ORG', 1), 'Forza Italia': ('ORG', 1), 'League': ('ORG', 1), 'Five Star Movement': ('ORG', 1), 'Five Star': ('ORG', 1), 'EU': ('ORG', 2), 'Italians': ('MISC', 1)}"
160,Chinese envoy to US criticizes Biden admin for undermining the one-China principle with support for Taiwan secessionists,Global Times,2022-07-21,"Photo: screenshot from US.China-embassy.gov.cn The China Ambassador to the US, Qin Gang, criticized the Joe Biden administration on Wednesday for undermining the one-China principle through its support to Taiwan secessionists and exacerbating tensions with its so-called human rights claims on China’s Hong Kong and Xinjiang issues.During a sideline chat at the Aspen Institute Security Forum, Qin mainly elaborated China’s policy and position on its relations with the US, the Taiwan question, the Hong Kong and Xinjiang issues, the Ukraine crisis and CPTPP among other issues, the China Embassy in the US announced on its official website on Thursday.On whether China and the US have entered a ""new Cold War"", Qin said that the Cold War is a tragedy in world history and a synonym for estrangement, division, confrontation and conflict. People are worried that the Cold War will repeat itself because some people cling to the Cold War mentality and mistakenly see China as the former threat of the Soviet Union . “But China is not the former Soviet Union and the Communist Party of China is not the Communist Party of the Soviet Union,” Qin stressed.China loves peace, unswervingly follows the path of peaceful development and actively promotes the building of a community with a shared future for mankind. To see China as a threat is to pick the wrong adversary, the China ambassador said.A “new Cold War” will only have losers and no winners. It will only erect a new Berlin Wall and plunge the world back into turmoil and division with consequences the humanity cannot afford. China does not want a ""new Cold War"" and neither do other countries, Qin noted.President Joe Biden also repeatedly stressed that the US has no intention of seeking ""new Cold War"" with China, said Qin, noting that he hopes the US will match words with deeds, not engage in ideological confrontation or exclusion, avoid ""decoupling,” or an arms race.On the Taiwan question, Qin said that this has always been the most important and sensitive core issue in China-US relations. China loves peace and the last thing we want is for compatriots to quarrel with each other. We will strive for the prospect of peaceful reunification with utmost sincerity and efforts. To prevent the prospect of peace from being undermined, we must unswervingly adhere to the one-China principle, which is the political foundation of China-US relations and the cornerstone of peace across the Taiwan Straits, the ambassador stressed.In recent years, the Taiwan authorities have refused to accept the one-China principle and pursued a ""gradual Taiwan independence"" with the help of the US. In the meantime, US has been distorting and hollowing out the one-China principle, wantonly improving its official relations with the island of Taiwan, sending senior officials to visit the island, selling Taiwan a large number of advanced weapons and making wrong remarks about ""military defense of Taiwan,"" according to Qin.We will not abandon non-peaceful means, not against the residents of the island, but to contain ""Taiwan independence"" forces, prevent external interference and safeguard the prospect of China's peaceful reunification, Qin stated.We hope that the US will keep its words and firmly oppose and contain ""Taiwan independence."" “Give peace a chance, let peace win,” said the ambassador.On the issues related to the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region and the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, Qin said that the so-called Hong Kong and Xinjiang issues are not about democracy, human rights, ethnic groups or religion at all, but about fighting against violence, terrorism and separatism, protecting people's lives and safeguarding China's sovereignty, security and development interests. Xinjiang should not be allowed to turn into another “Islamic state,” the ambassador said.After Hong Kong returned to the motherland, decolonization should be realized, Hong Kong should be governed by patriots, and ""one country, two systems"" should be implemented steadily. As US President Abraham Lincoln said: ""A house divided against itself cannot stand."" The House of China will become stronger and stand firm, Qin said.On the Ukraine crisis, Qin said that there are complex historical and practical reasons behind the it. When responding to the Ukraine crisis, China always makes its own judgment based on the merits of the case. China maintains that the sovereign territorial integrity of all countries should be respected, the purposes and principles of the UN Charter should be respected, the legitimate security concerns of all countries should be heeded, and all efforts conducive to the peaceful settlement of the crisis should be supported. China's position is objective and fair, and the position of India, Brazil, South Africa, Indonesia and the majority of developing countries is similar, Qin pointed out.At the moment, the impact of the Ukraine crisis continues to spill over, giving rise to multiple risks in the economy, energy supply, food insecurity and waves of refugees. It is imperative to achieve a ceasefire and resume peace talks, the China ambassador urged. The US and NATO should also sit down with Russia for negotiations, seek solutions based on each other's legitimate concerns, and jointly build a balanced, effective and sustainable EU security architecture, Qin called.On the China-Russia joint statement in February, Qin said that China-Russia relations are non-aligned, non-confrontational and not targeted at any third country. The China-Russia joint statement states that the two countries jointly oppose a return to Cold War mentality and any incitement to ideological and geopolitical confrontation, advocate to promote democracy in international relations, maintain the purpose and principles of the UN Charter, and practice multilateralism. In this regard, China's cooperation with any country can be endless. If the US is willing to make joint efforts with China to this end, we certainly welcome them, Qin noted.",CHINA,DIPLOMACY,Picture description not found,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'US': ('LOC', 8), 'China': ('LOC', 16), 'Taiwan': ('LOC', 3), 'Hong Kong': ('LOC', 2), 'Xinjiang': ('LOC', 2), 'Ukraine': ('LOC', 1), 'Soviet Union': ('LOC', 3), 'Berlin Wall': ('LOC', 1), 'Qin Gang': ('PER', 7), 'Joe Biden': ('PER', 2), 'one': ('MISC', 1), 'CPTP': ('MISC', 1), 'Cold War': ('MISC', 7), 'Aspen Institute Security Forum': ('ORG', 1), 'Communist Party of China': ('ORG', 1), 'Communist Party of the': ('ORG', 1)}"
161,"Putin visits Iran for trilateral summit, ‘a punch back’ on heels of Biden’s empty-handed Mideast trip",Zhang Han and Zhang Changyue,2022-07-19,"Russia President Vladimir Putin visited Iran on Tuesday to hold talks with his Turkey and Iran counterparts. Yet the visit received notable international attention for its timing, coming on the heels of US President Joe Biden's Middle East trip, making Vladimir Putin's visit look like ""a punch back"" after US attempts to assert influence in the region. Vladimir Putin on Tuesday met with Iran President Ebrahim Raisi and Turkey President Recep Tayyip Erdogan separately before a tripartite summit, his second foreign trip since the country's special military operations in Ukraine. Vladimir Putin and Raisi reportedly discussed ways for expansion of bilateral relations in different areas, including energy, transit, trade exchanges and regional developments, according to Iran news agency IRNA.Kremlin aide Yury Ushakov called Iran an important partner of Russia because relations between the countries are friendly, have a long history, and are developing very effectively in a wide range of areas. Moscow and Tehran have plans to take bilateral cooperation to a new level of a strategic partnership, so a new bilateral agreement is being prepared, Ushakov said, according to TASS.Vladimir Putin's bilateral meeting with Erdogan is expected to touch on the issue of Ukraine grain exports from the Black Sea ports, according to the Kremlin official. Zhu Weilie, director of the Middle East Studies Institute at Shanghai International Studies University, told the Global Times on Tuesday that Vladimir Putin's visit was already scheduled, but considering Joe Biden's ambitious ""vacuum remarks"" which yielded very limited results in the Middle East, Vladimir Putin's visit indeed looks like ""a punch in the US' face."" Joe Biden said earlier in front of six Gulf states, Egypt, Jordan and Iraq that the US will remain an active, engaged partner in the Middle East, and US will not walk away and leave a vacuum to be filled by Russia, China or Iran. Observers pointed out that although the US-led West has been tightening sanctions on Russia, the Kremlin is not cornered diplomatically. Over the past years, from negotiations to set a buffer zone at the Turkey-Syria border, to developing connections with Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) in energy and the military, as well as deepening partnership with Iran, Russia has established pragmatic relationships with regional countries and secured its presence, according to experts. It is hard to edge Russia out of this region, not only because Russia has a strong presence there, but also because it shares strong energy ties with regional countries, Zhu said. The US' influence in Middle East has been declining in face of the major changes in the international situation, and major regional countries including Turkey, Iran and Saudi Arabia have stronger autonomy and make foreign policy more independently, said the expert. Yin Gang, a research fellow at the Institute of West-Asia and Africa Studies of the China Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times that Syria will definitely be on Vladimir Putin's agenda. The settlement of the Syrian issue is in line with all parties' will. Russia wants to save its strength that has long been involved in the war in Syria, Yin said. Restoration of peace and stability in Syria will also benefit its neighbor Turkey. The three heads of state will discuss steps to fully eradicate the hotbed of international terrorism in Syria, the facilitation of the inter-Syrian peace process and solutions to humanitarian issues, including post-conflict reconstruction, Russia Today reported on Tuesday. Vladimir Putin, Raisi and Erdogan will issue a joint statement after the negotiations, media reported. For bilateral topics, observers said the Iran nuclear deal is on the agenda, yet substantial progress can hardly be made in this occasion. Commenting on the Vladimir Putin-Erdogan meeting which will focus on food security, Yin believes Russia may cooperate and facilitate the resumption of grain exports from Ukraine, considering that military conflicts have dealt a blow to buyers of Ukraine grain, including many in the Middle East.  Food security was also one of the main subjects of the phone conversation between Vladimir Putin and Erdogan last week. The Turkey leader said at the time that ""it was time for the UN to take action for the plan regarding the formation of secure corridors via the Black Sea.""Turkey has been engaged in various issue-resolving initiatives and recently hosted multilateral consultations on the grain issue with the participation of Russia, Ukraine and the UN.",CHINA,DIPLOMACY,"Russian President Vladimir Putin and Iran's President Ebrahim Raisi hold a meeting in Tehran on July 19, 2022.

162,US oil not the fundamental solution for EU’s energy woes,Wang Yi,2022-07-19,"For the first time in six years, the EU (EU) has overtaken Asia as the biggest buyer of US crude oil, Bloomberg reported. The EU imported 213.1 million barrels US crude over the first five months of the year, while Asia imported 191.1 million barrels, new US Census Bureau data showed.This drastic change in global energy flows is widely seen by observers as a result of the Russia-Ukraine conflict and the intensifying sanctions from the West countries on Russia, one of the world's most important energy exporters.Since the outbreak of the Russia-Ukraine conflict in February, the US and other West countries has successively imposed intensive sanctions on Russia, involving finance, energy, technology and many other aspects. Despite strong opposition voices within the bloc, on June 3, the EU adopted a sixth package of sanctions, including a partial embargo on Russia oil. The US is busy lobbying more countries to jointly put a price cap on Russia oil exports. These moves have worsened a supply shortage in global market and pushed up the energy prices.Given its heavy dependence on energy imports from Russia, the EU is bearing the brunt of the current difficult situation in global energy market. According to the BBC, under varied pressures created by the energy crisis, Germany and other leading countries advocating global environmental protection have to reactivate the abandoned coal power projects. Since June, gas operators in Germany, France, Italy and other West EU countries have said that their planned supply of gas from Russia has fallen sharply, which may cause supply gap in winter.Worse, in addition to the energy crisis, the biggest threat to the EU economy that is not likely to be resolved in short term, EU is also facing high inflationary pressures and the risk of economic recession. Annual inflation in the euro zone's COVID-19 countries reportedly hit 8.6 percent in June, surging past the 8.1 percent recorded in May. In the context of rising energy prices, the EU Commission predicts that the inflation rate in the euro zone will hit a record high this year. Meanwhile, EU's GDP growth is expected to be just 2.6 percent; the growth outlook for 2023 is even much bleaker.Increasing energy imports from the US may be a short-term solution for EU's energy crisis, but analysts said that US oil might not be enough to fill the gap left by Russia oil once the EU embargo on the latter takes effect later this year, as the US production of crude is not growing fast enough to respond to demand in the EU. Moreover, the current increase in EU energy imports from the US is more of a forced move. While energy supply shortages and rising prices can be alleviated in the short term, it is not expected to fundamentally solve the underlying problem.For a long time, due to high energy prices in the US, its competitiveness in the international market has actually been weak. The increase in EU energy imports from the US is actually a supply chain change that benefits the US. But for EU, what needs to be seen is that once it builds up the facilities to support long-term import growth from the US, this will increase the cost of energy imports in EU, which could lead to EU's temporary energy supply woes becoming a long-term source of inflationary pressures. The author is an editor with the Global Times. bizopinion@globaltimes.com.cn",SOURCE,ECONOMY,Illustration: Chen Xia/Global Times,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'Bloomberg': ('ORG', 1), 'US Census Bureau': ('ORG', 1), 'BBC': ('ORG', 1), 'EU Commission': ('ORG', 12), 'Asia': ('LOC', 2), 'US': ('LOC', 7), 'Russia': ('LOC', 9), 'Ukraine': ('LOC', 2), 'Germany': ('LOC', 2), 'France': ('LOC', 1), 'Italy': ('LOC', 1), 'West': ('MISC', 3)}"
163,"China, EU could cooperate amid US 'disreputable role' in worsening world food crisis",Liu Xin,2022-07-20,"While the world is grappling with an urgent food crisis and a devastating global inflation, the US is still trying to shift blame by criticizing and pressuring China, which analysts said is disreputable. The analysts also called for more cooperation between China and the EU to take concrete actions to secure food security and global chain by seeking consensus on the proposal put forward by China and EU's efforts in defusing the crisis.  The global food crisis has drawn more attention recently and on Monday the UN held a special meeting to discuss how to deal with the urgent crisis. The UN President Abdulla Shahid said that scaling up climate resilience across food systems is among the actions needed to counter rising hunger and malnutrition.The World Bank has also warned that the conflict in Ukraine will plunge an additional 95 million people into extreme poverty, and 50 million into severe hunger, this year.  The US and some West countries are imputing the skyrocketed food prices to the conflicts between Russia and Ukraine as Ukraine is a leading wheat exporter and accusing Russia warships of blocking ports. In addition, they are also criticizing China for not helping to solve the crisis.  On Monday, at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, Samantha Power, administrator of the US Agency for International Development (USAID), urged other nations including China to do more to fight a food crisis aggravated by the conflicts in Ukraine. She also pinned blame on China over its trade restrictions on fertilizer and ""hoarding"" of grain while millions of people in East Africa face starvation, media reported. In response to Power's accusation, China Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said at Tuesday's press conference that as a developing country, China is not obligated for development assistance but as the second contributor of UN membership fees, China has always actively taken a part in global development cooperation to make contributions to secure global food security. Zhao noted that since the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic, China has actively offered food assistance to some countries and it is also the only developing country that has offered the most money to the UN food cooperation agencies, sent the most experts and took part in the most programs. ""The international community knows who is making the global food crisis … we hope the US could reflect its disreputable role in making such crisis and stop groundlessly accuse China,"" Zhao said.  China has nothing to do with the current global food supply chain disruptions. The root cause was the expansion of NATO that fueled the conflicts between Russia and Ukraine, which are major grain exporters in the world, a Beijing-based research fellow focusing on Russia, who asked for anonymity, told the Global Times on Tuesday.In the first half of 2022, China's exports of food and live animals totaled $35.39 billion, up 11.4 percent year-on-year, according to statistics from the General Administration of Customs.The global food problem caused by the conflict between Russia and Ukraine will depend on the political settlement of the issue to alleviate the problem, Hu Qimu, chief research fellow at the Sinosteel Economic Research Institute, told the Global Times on Tuesday.The current problems are caused more by sanctions led by the US on Russia. Russia, which was a major global grain, energy and fertilizer exporter, cannot play its role as market player under sanctions, Li Yong, deputy chairman of the Expert Committee of the China Association of International Trade, told the Global Times.""The global crisis has come to a point that it has to be managed. Energy and food prices are pushing up global inflation. EU's current predicament is likely to lead to division and divergence within the EU,"" said Li.The EU has suffered more since the Ukraine crisis. It has been busy dealing with the food crisis recently and is hopeful that a deal between Ukraine and Russia over the exports of grain can be reached this week to allow for millions of tones of Ukraine grains that are currently stuck in Black Sea ports to be exported. The grain export issue of Ukraine has made some progress under the mediation of the international community and the UN, and the EU can still play its role in further solving the problem at this time, Cui Hongjian, director of the Department of EU Studies at the China Institute of International Studies, told the Global Times on Tuesday.The EU can first provide convenience and security guarantee for grain transportation in Ukraine, including communication and coordination with neighboring EU countries and effective diplomatic mediation to avoid miscalculation and further deterioration of the situation, Cui said.In addition, the EU should also maintain direct and effective communication with Russia, because the two sides have not solved this issue through direct negotiation, which has brought some obstacles to the solution of grain export issue, the expert explained.Analysts noted that EU could also promote dialogue and cooperation with China on jointly dealing with the food crisis instead of following the US in criticizing China. As an important member of the UN, China has also played an important role in setting up a special group on energy and food issues authorized by the UN to carry out relevant work.China has also made its proposal in solving the food crisis. China's Mission to the EU released a statement on its website on Monday, listing what China says and does on ensuring global food security and calling on more countries to put aside their differences and work together. Moreover, during the UN meeting on food crisis on Monday, on behalf of the Group of Friends of the Global Development Initiative, China Ambassador Zhang Jun, Permanent Representative of China to the UN, called for coordinating policy response to the global food crisis at the special meeting and put forward China's solution.Zhang called on the international community to urgently support countries affected by the food crisis and urged all stakeholders, including developed countries to strengthen cooperation and keep a strong focus on the transformation of the global food system towards its fairness and sustainability. Moreover, ""we must eliminate any unilateral and protectionist measures that run counter to the spirit and rules of the WTO,"" said Zhang. It is a very appropriate choice for China and the EU to discuss relevant issues through high-level dialogues, Cui said, noting that the cooperation between China and the EU is based on the consensus of upholding multilateralism and being responsible to the international community, minimizing and even avoiding the negative spillover effects caused by the Ukraine crisis.",CHINA,DIPLOMACY,China-EU relationship Photo: VCG,"Reporter, Beijing","Liu Xin co-leads the Global Times China desk.

 The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) warned on Tuesday that EU's heat wave could persist into the middle of next week, whereas the negative impacts of climate change are bound to continue at least until 2060s.""The question that everybody is asking looking ahead is when this is going to end. Unfortunately, looking at all the models from our partners at a national and regional level, possibly not until the middle of next week,"" Robert Stefanski, chief of Applied Climate Services at the WMO, said at a joint press briefing with the World Health Organization (WHO).According to Stefanski, the heat wave is already peaking in EU and is moving eastward, ""but temperatures will still be much above normal.""At 11 a.m. local time on Tuesday, the United Kingdom (UK) recorded an all-time high temperature of 39.1 degrees Celsius, but a few hours later, the mercury rose above 40 degrees Celsius at London Heathrow, said WMO Secretary General Petteri Taalas.""Record heat waves are becoming more frequent because of climate change,"" Taalas said, likening global warming to an athlete using performance enhancing substances.""When sportsmen use such substances, the intensity of their performance increases. Similarly, we have been doping our atmosphere by injecting more and more greenhouse gases, especially carbon dioxide, into the atmosphere,"" said Taalas.Besides human health, the WMO chief warned that the heat waves will also have a negative impact on agriculture, exacerbating the already huge loss of harvest due to the Russia-Ukraine conflict.He said that intense heat waves could become annual occurrences in the coming decades, and that the negative impacts of climate change will continue at least until the 2060s ""regardless of our success in climate mitigation.""The authorities in Hungary issued a Level 3 heat alert on Tuesday as the country is hit by a heat wave that has brought scorching temperatures to EU.The alert is expected to remain in force until at least Saturday midnight. This is Hungary's second Level 3 heat alert this summer. The previous one was issued on June 27 and lasted three days.In Hungary, a Level 3 (highest) heat alert is issued by the National Public Health Center (NNK) when the daily mean temperature exceeds 27 degrees Celsius for at least three consecutive days.This summer has been unusually hot and dry in Hungary. The drought has damaged crops, wheat has to be harvested early and the cornfields are struggling to thrive without water.The harvest is still going on in the country, but according to the latest estimates by the Hungarian Chamber of Agriculture, the yield can be more than 20 percent less than the normal output of five million tons of wheat and 6.5-8 million tons of corn.The maximum daytime temperatures in Hungary are expected to peak on Thursday at around 40 degrees Celsius.The heatwave also swept across the Netherlands on Tuesday, one of the hottest days since the Dutch measurements started in 1901.The highest temperature of the day, 39.5 degrees, was measured in Maastricht, a city in the southern province of Limburg, according to the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute (KNMI). In the coastal province of Zeeland, temperatures rose to 39.1 degrees.The National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM) activated the national heat plan for Monday and Tuesday, and issued a smog warning.Extremely high temperatures were also recorded on Tuesday in Switzerland and much of southern France. In Italy, Wednesday will mark a ""code red"" state of emergency in nine cities. The warning, which means the heat could be life threatening, will impact cities including Rome, Florence, and Bologna. Italy officials warned residents and tourists to stay indoors during the hottest hours of the day.The heat wave has also led to several fire disasters across EU.On Tuesday, a team of Croatian aerial firefighters joined their colleagues in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) to help put out a fire that has been raging since Saturday on Cvrsnica Mountain, some 50 kilometers south of Sarajevo, said Ministry of Security of BiH.It said the fire has not claimed lives, but has ravaged uninhabited mountainous areas near the municipalities of Konjic, Capljina and Citluk.The Council of Ministers of BiH called for help on Monday, and Croatia responded by sending a Canadair plane, designed specifically for aerial firefighting. It joined the BiH Army's two helicopters that were unable to bring the fire under control due to the heat wave, high winds and inaccessible terrain. BiH and Croatia maintain a long-term agreement for mutual assistance in the event of natural disasters.In another development, a massive wildfire broke out Tuesday in the northern suburbs of Greece's capital Athens, damaging houses and evicting residents in four communities at the foothills of Pentelikon mountain.Fire Service spokesperson Ioannis Artopoios told a televised emergency press briefing that there were no reports of people trapped.",PHOTO,WORLD,"Teenagers jump into the water during a heatwave in Haarlem, the Netherlands, on July 19, 2022.

I didn't care about the time because this is the first time I win a world title,"" said Dos Santos.Warholm led coming into the home straight but seized up badly and eventually came in seventh (48.42), breaking a winning streak of 22 races, including 18 finals, dating back to September 2018.""It was a very tough race,"" Warholm said. ""I had an injury but to me it's always your fight and giving your all and leaving it all on the track.""""I felt I did that.

Wightman sealed victory in 3 minutes 29.23 seconds, Ingebrigtsen taking silver in 3:29.47, with Spaniard Mohamed Katir claiming bronze (3:29.90).Family affairIn a bizarre twist, Wightman's father Geoff is in Eugene doing the in-stadium commentary.Geoff, also his son's coach, was reduced to a cracked voice as he announced to Hayward Field: ""That's my son and he's world champion.""""For him to be part of my journey to get to this point, and actually part of the actual race itself is so unique,"" Wightman said of his father. ""I talked to him and he's very happy.

""I'm not in pain, I'll be good.""While Kerley was left digesting a disappointing early exit, there were no such worries for defending 200-meter world champion Noah Lyles, who romped home in his semi-final with a blistering COVID-19.62 seconds.The main threat to Lyles' hopes of retaining his 200-meter world title may well come from teenage teammate and emerging rival Erriyon Knighton.

167,FM spokesperson retorts US official seeing export curbs on Russia as template to counter China – ‘Cold War mentality won’t succeed’,Global Times,2022-07-20,"Facts have repeatedly shown that any country that embraces Cold-War mentality and has a penchant for confrontation will not succeed, but will only backfire on itself and negatively impact global peace and security, China Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said Wednesday in Beijing.Wang made the comment in response to a senior US official who sees sanctioning curbs on exports to Russia as ""a template"" to counter China.""The USs successful collaboration with 37 other nations that's driven down exports to Russia serves as a blueprint for a new regime on tackling threats from China,"" according to a Bloomberg report, citing the head of the Commerce Department's Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS).""When US officials talk about restricting exports to Russia, they use the word 'success' to describe the attempt. I don't know where the so-called success comes from?"" Wang Wenbin told a regular press conference in Beijing on Wednesday.""What the world sees clearly is that the US is currently facing its most severe inflation in 40 years. The elevated food and energy prices in the US have driven the US people miserable, and the sentiment of US consumers has dropped to the lowest point since 1952,"" Wang said.Moreover, the world's stock market, forex market, crude oil, natural gas, grain and non-ferrous metal markets have all gone volatile lately, which has greatly affected the people of all countries, especially those in developing countries with weak economic foundations, the spokesperson noted.A poll shows that 85 percent of US adults believe that the US is headed in the wrong direction. As the initiator of the Ukraine crisis, the US has kept on aggravating conflict, wielding club of economic sanctions, and engaging in economic coercions, which not only undermined the normal exchanges between countries, violated the norms of international trade, but also complicated and exacerbated the Ukraine crisis, Wang added.Global Times",SOURCE,COMPANIES,Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Wang Wenbin Photo: VCG,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'Cold - War': ('MISC', 1), 'China': ('LOC', 3), 'Beijing': ('LOC', 2), 'US': ('LOC', 10), 'Russia': ('LOC', 3), 'Ukraine': ('LOC', 2), 'Foreign Ministry': ('ORG', 1), 'Bloomberg': ('ORG', 1), 'Commerce Department': ('ORG', 1), 'Bureau of Industry and Security': ('ORG', 1), 'BIS': ('ORG', 1), 'Wang Wenbin': ('PER', 5)}"
168,The world must move past ‘spheres of influence’,Ding Gang,2022-07-20,"Professor Da Wei, a professor at School of Social Sciences, Tsinghua University, recently published a paper called ""Security Concerns are Reasonable, Spheres of Influence are Not (The US Quarterly Volume 45, 2022 - Issue 2)."" The essay provides a China perspective for those willing to understand China's position on great power diplomacy, particularly the conflict between Russia and Ukraine.In his article, Da emphasizes that security concerns are not exclusive,which is the most fundamental difference from spheres of influence. While China culture emphasizes the lawfulness of an action or policy, it also often emphasizes the need to be sensible and reasonable. Being sensible, reasonable, and lawful constitutes three levels of consideration that China culture often uses when judging an action or policy. Lawfulness is the most important consideration in the political sphere, whilst being sensible and reasonable is also criteria that strategists and decision-makers need to consider.If one reads this article carefully, he or she should be able to see that the China have their own basic positions and principles on international affairs, especially on what kind of diplomatic strategy a large country like China should have, and that the process of forming them is related to China's history, tradition, and culture. Therefore, this has some differences with the West.When I discussed Professor Da's view with China and foreign scholars, some of them thought that it would be better to replace ""reasonable"" with ""legitimate."" I asked Da, and he said that he used ""reasonable"" mainly because it is backed by reason, and that ""legitimate"" has to do with rules, laws, and natural rights, as can be seen from the root of the word. ""I don't think security concerns have anything to do with those. There is often a bit of 'reason' behind a country's security concerns, and this is where reason can be applied,"" Da said.If you see China's foreign policy through the binoculars of the basic West concept of diplomacy, for instance, the logic of sphere of influence, you will of course misjudge it, and even develop extreme perceptions of China as an enemy. Some Westerners who are now playing up the ""China threat theory"" are by and large following this logic in looking at China, particularly when observing China's attitude toward Russia-Ukraine conflict. The danger is that when this logic is extended to the policy arena, they are intentionally creating China as their own enemy. The China have an aversion to spheres of influence, as do many once colonized countries in Asia, who have come out of imperial spheres of influence and are therefore very wary of falling into the trap again.Being part of a sphere of influence not only means that they have to follow the leadership of the big power, but also that they have to follow the rules and fight for that specific sphere of influence, which leads to a world of bloc warfare, where this street is yours and that is another bloc's. Unfortunately, the West tends not to understand the miserable experiences of these former colonies.Once you join NATO, you have NATO to protect your security, but NATO is a military bloc, and as a result, you run the risk of becoming the enemy of the opposite side of the sphere of influence. And how your opponents see you, of course, will also look through the lens of a sphere of influence.One of the results of the Russia-Ukraine conflict was to redraw a deep divide across spheres of influence, and now we are seeing a rapid development in Russia's relations with Iran, North Korea and others. We might even wonder if there will be the emergence of another new military bloc to rival NATO.The US is following the same path with China containment, and when US identifies China as a competitor, the key is that it sees this competitor in terms of the fight for spheres of influence. Competition does not necessarily lead to war, but if competition is seen as a struggle for spheres of influence, to fight China through alliances, to come up with some five-eyed alliance, CHIP4, AUKUS… the result is toward bloc antagonism, and eventually China will be identified as the enemy.It is probably time for the West to try to walk away a little bit from the old security logic of ""sphere of influence"" and think more about the concept of security concerns.The author is a senior editor with People's Daily, and currently a senior fellow with the Chongyang Institute for Financial Studies at Renmin University of China. dinggang@globaltimes.com.cn.

169,"Weakening euro adds costs on Chinese goods in Europe; impact offset by falling freight price, dollar settlement",Xie Jun,2022-07-20,"Qiu, the representative of a sanitary goods company in China's Wenzhou, found that his customers in EU are no longer buying as much volume as they did in the past after the euro weakened largely against the US dollar and the China yuan. Some customers have cancelled orders, while one Spanish customer had informed Qiu in advance that their order demands will decrease by about 20 percent this year. This is bothering Qiu. ""My biggest wish right now is orders. Some companies are even willing to take orders even if that means losing money,"" he said. Qiu is one of the numerous China exporters feeling the sting of a weakening euro, as a large part of commodities traded between China and the EU, China's second largest trading partner, is settled in euro. The appreciation of the yuan against euro will make China goods more ""expensive"" for EU customers, thus making EU importers less willing to import China goods. However, experts stressed that such a situation is offset by many factors that are beneficial to China exporters, such as the dropping freight cost and rising inflation in EU, which makes them more sensitive in searching for cost effective products like those provided by China factories. Thus, the negative influence exerted by the depreciating euro on China exports is still limited. Bigger pressure Against the backdrop of Ukraine-Russia conflicts and the US Federal Reserve interest rate hikes, the euro has showed a depreciating trend in recent months against the US dollar. On July 13 it even briefly dipped below parity with the US dollar, a one-to-one exchange rate and a sight unseen since December 2002, a New York Times report noted. The euro's exchange rate against the yuan also showed a similar trend of depreciation. As of press time the euro stood at 6.9167 against the yuan, compared with 8.17 at the end of August in 2020.The weakening euro against the yuan is making China products less competitively priced in local markets, thus adding some pressure on China exports to EU markets. Li Ping, a lamp exporter based in Yiwu, the China city dubbed the world small commodity capital, told the Global Times that orders from EU customers decreased this year, and one important reason is that the euro has depreciated largely, making importers incapable of bearing cost hikes.""Many EU customers ask to reduce prices after making orders, with the reason that the euro's depreciation places a lot of pressure on them,"" Li said, adding that they don't have much price negotiation rights as small-sized exporters, and they have to give up the orders if profits are too thin. ""The money we are making can't even beat risks in transportation and exchange rate fluctuations,"" she said. On the other hand, EU importers of China products are also experiencing headaches over the weakening euro, as it would make China goods more expensive to customers and make them less willing to buy products they don't need urgently. Long Dan, who runs a home electric appliances shopping mall in Germany's Hamburg, told the Global Times that a China-made television that used to cost about 300 euros ($307.5) now costs about 350 euros because of the exchange rate fluctuation. According to Long, euro depreciation is definitely not good news for sellers like them. Particularly, when product prices are hiking in Germany, consumers often delay or even cancel plans to buy electric appliances. Offset factors However, there are also a number of factors that help to offset the negative impact of euro fluctuation on China exports, both experts and businesspeople said, which make China-EU exports still on a robust track in recent months.One such factor is the decreasing transportation price, which helps reduce the cost of China-EU trade. For example, Long noted that price of a 40-foot container shipped from Shanghai to Hamburg has decreased to about 7,000 euros currently compared with more than 10,000 euros at the second half of last year. Because of reducing freight cost, some EU importers have kept prices unchanged for some China-made commodities. Chen Jia, a research fellow at the International Monetary Institute of the Renmin University of China, told the Global Times on Wednesday that theoretically speaking, the depreciation of the euro against the yuan would create a negative impact for China exports to EU, but in reality, the influence is limited because for one, China-EU trade is not only settled in euro, but also in other currencies like the US dollar and the yuan as well, which will offset the impact of euro depreciation. For another thing, China's supply chains have proved that it's hard to find substitutes for China goods in the short term around the globe, and therefore EU's demands for China goods don't entirely depend upon price, especially exchange rate fluctuation. Besides, the intention and movements between China and EU to carry out all-around cooperation are increasing recently, Chen said. ""Judging from historical experience, the foundation of China-EU trade is very solid. The two sides have relatively strong complementarities, while the distribution of upper stream and downstream industrial chains is relatively reasonable. Short-term intensification of euro fluctuation will not create too much negative impact on China-EU bilateral trade,"" Chen said. Bai Ming, deputy director of the international market research institute at the China Academy of International Trade and Economic Cooperation, also told the Global Times on Wednesday that although euro's depreciation would theoretically boost EU's exports to China, the impact is largely restricted by the fact that EU's supply chains and production capacities are taking a blow from the COVID19 outbreak and other crises. China's exports to EU rose COVID-19.1 percent to $277 billion in the first six months this year, China customs data showed. Imports fell 7.6 by percent. US influence Experts also noted that behind the euro's depreciation trend there lie many other economic problems currently faced by the economic bloc, including rising inflation, energy crisis and so forth, a situation in which the US has played a big part in exacerbating.For example, Chen noted that EU has already been reliant upon Russia's cheap energy to drive economy. Therefore, the US' urge for EU to implement sanctions against Russia has led EU to ""shoot itself in the foot."" ""EU's energy products inflation level has surged to an unprecedented level after slashing imports from Russia. Although such inflation has showed signs ahead of the Ukraine crisis, undoubtedly the problem's acceleration is caused by energy sanction toward Russia,"" he said. On the other hand, EU central banks' monetary policies are also being suppressed by Fed's interest hikes, Chen said. He said that even after the EU was established, EU's political decisions can't shake off influence from the US, which makes the region harder to gain independence in global strategy. ""It has been realized by many that the source of EU's political and economic structural problems is the US. But it tests the wisdom of EU politicians on how to march the first step toward removing undue US influence,"" he said.",SOURCE,ECONOMY,A view of a port in Shanghai Photo: VCG,"Reporter, Shanghai","Global Times reporter based in Shanghai, covering financial news and breaking news related to large corps surrounding Shanghai.","{'Qiu': ('PER', 3), 'Qi': ('PER', 1), 'China': ('LOC', 13), 'Wenzhou': ('LOC', 1), 'US': ('LOC', 3), 'Ukraine': ('LOC', 1), 'Russia': ('LOC', 1), 'EU': ('ORG', 8), 'US Federal Reserve': ('ORG', 1), 'New York Times': ('ORG', 1), 'Spanish': ('MISC', 1)}"
170,Western countries tumble in coping with heat wave; time to realize necessity of climate cooperation,GT staff reporters,2022-07-20,"  
A firefighter sprays water over festival-goers on the fourth and last day of the 30th edition of the musical festival Les Vieilles Charrues in Carhaix-Plouguer, West France, on July 17, 2022. France and UK went on high alert on Monday, bracing for record temperatures from a punishing heat wave as deadly wildfires raging in parts of southwest EU showed no sign of abating. Photo: VCG As the ""unprecedented heat wave"" is scorching EU and the US, self-claimed climate change leaders and vanguards, especially the US, are struggling to deal with the pressing crisis. With US President Joe Biden hesitating to declare climate emergency, and EU countries forced back to use coal again, China scientists said those facts should cool West countries down from chiding China on the issue of coal; and make them realize people's lives should be the priority. With top environment officials from China, the US and EU holding frequent meetings recently, experts noted the warming globe is pressing major powers to join hands in tackling this dilemma. They urged US to stop sabotaging climate cooperation with China, as it is US' paranoia and poisoned political situation that stands in the way of achieving fruitful results with China, and delivering positive climate achievements to the world. The heat wave in the UK and EU continent has made worldwide headlines in recent days. The UK recorded its hottest-ever day on Tuesday, with temperatures hitting a high of 40.3 C in the east of England, as London's fire service tackled several blazes across the capital, CNBC reported.Across the English Channel, record temperatures across EU have claimed the lives of at least 1,500 people, with train tracks buckling and fires raging across the continent, according to ABC Australia.The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) warned on Tuesday that EU's heat wave could persist into the middle of next week, whereas the negative impacts of climate change are bound to continue at least until 2060s.Heat alerts covered more than 20 states on Tuesday and Wednesday across the Southern Plains and parts of the Northeast in the US, and temperatures will soar above the century mark for 60 million people over the next week, according to CNN. In China, the scorching heat that engulfed southern China for weeks is expanding further to northern parts of the country, said the country's National Meteorological Center (NMC). Jiang Debin, an official from China Electricity Council, told the Economic Daily that despite the heat wave, plus the country's fastened pace in resuming production, ""demand and supply of electricity are balanced, and there's no power rationing or power cuts."" In an interview with the Global Times, Lorenzo Labrador, Scientific Officer at WMO's Global Atmosphere Watch Programme, said that he expects above-average temperatures all over the globe to become a trend. ""The reason is that, whereas heat waves are a normal atmospheric phenomenon, the increasing concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere that cause the atmosphere to retain more heat makes heat waves more likely and its temperatures more severe. We have been seeing this trend for a number of years now and it is likely to continue in the future,"" said the WMO scientist. ""The scientific community agrees that increasing greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere are responsible for the rising temperatures throughout the planet. Therefore, the only way to stop and revert the trend in higher temperatures is to make reductions in greenhouse gas emissions on a global scale,"" said Labrador. 

Rail passengers pass an electronic sign warning of 'Extremely hot weather' forecast for July 18 and COVID-19, advising commuters to only travel for essential journeys, at Kings Cross station in London on July 17, 2022. The UK's meteorological agency on Friday issued its first ever ""red"" warning for exceptional heat, forecasting record highs of 40 degrees Celsius next week. West tumbles under heat waveDespite suffering a historical heat wave that is wreaking havoc on society and economy of EU countries and the US, the West who has labeled itself as the vanguard on climate change, is tumbling in dealing with the thorny issue. Rejoining the Paris climate pact is hailed as a symbolic and practical first step for Joe Biden after he took office last year. Yet when the heat wave became more pressing, Joe Biden only plans to promote new efforts to combat climate change, but not declare an emergency that would unlock federal resources to deal with the issue despite increasing pressure from climate activists and Democratic lawmakers, AP reported. Experts said that Joe Biden's hesitation in declaring climate emergency is a vivid demonstration of how US' ambitious verbal promises will eventually end up being dwarfed by its petty actions.Declaring climate emergency may meet legal hurdles, and the US mid-term election will throw Joe Biden's efforts in great uncertainty as a Republican controlled House of Representatives may not allow allocation of funds, Wang Yiwei, director of the Institute of International Affairs at the Renmin University of China, told the Global Times.He noted that unlike China's concept of building ""a community with a shared future for mankind,"" US politicians always eye their own benefits, and the US system, focused on capital, totally ignores global equality and human values. ""The inconsistency of its words and actions … And the country's system makes the US an unreliable country in leading climate change,"" said Wang. In EU, major countries like Germany and the Netherlands are turning to coal to ensure they have enough power to keep the air conditioning running, and, in a few months, the heat on, according to Global News. This is partly reluctant response to Russia's decision of cutting back its gas exports to EU countries following the Ukraine crisis. EU's forced returning to coal should have the West realize that people's lives come first, and policy formulating needs to couple with this goal, Yang Fuqiang, a research fellow at Peking University's Research Institute for Energy, told the Global Times in response to West constant criticism of China's move to ""boost coal output."" China aims to have CO2 emissions peak before 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality before 2060.China's short-term goal and long-term goal are coordinating with each other, said Yang, noting that for example, the government stressed to avoid power rationing, because the heat wave is also engulfing China, and people's lives need to be guaranteed. A new cooperation areaRecently, environmental officials between China and the US, China and EU held talks to discuss climate issues. China's environment minister, Huang Runqiu visited the US last week, where he met with US Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo, deputy administrator of the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Janet McCabe and Gavin Newsom, the governor of California. The two countries have opened up their markets for technical services and products related to addressing climate change and ecological and environmental protection, Huang said, adding it strongly supported low-carbon energy transition and improving the quality of the environment and ecology for a ""win-win.""On July 9, Vice-Premier Han Zheng and Frans Timmermans, executive vice-president of the EU Commission for the EU Green Deal, held a virtual meeting, where both sides agreed to deepen cooperation on environment, climate and energy.Experts said climate cooperation has been pressing big powers such as China, the US and EU to join hands, as the climate crisis may come faster than predicted. China has made the gesture to cooperate as a responsible big power, it is the US, who talks about cooperation on the table and kicks China under the table, said Yang, noting US's paranoia and its highly politicized and poisoned political environment, which is also suffering from ""Sinophobia,"" has always hindered actual cooperation.Sun Shao, a senior researcher at the National Climate Center affiliated with the China Meteorological Administration, who has cooperation with the United Kingdom Met Office told the Global Times that one of the symbolic projects that highlight climate cooperation between the UK and China is the CSSP-China project, which aims to build strong partnership between UK and China climate scientists. Since being established in 2014, scientists from both countries have made great strides in researching extreme climate, and some of their results were implemented in real life.",CHINA,DIPLOMACY,"Anthony Harris, a local worker, wipes sweat from his face as he works with E-Z Bel Construction along Fredericksburg Road during an excessive heat warning in San Antonio, Texas, the US on July 19, 2022.

171,"With wavering sanctions, time for EU to see the situation and untie with US",Global Times,2022-07-20,"Reuters on Tuesday cited a draft document of the EU saying that the bloc will amend its sanctions on Russia by allowing the unfreezing of some funds of top Russia banks linked to trade in food and fertilizer.But while the EU carves out the exceptions on the one hand, it tightens the grip on the other. The EU is set to add Russia's top lender Sberbank and the head of giant zinc and copper firm UMMC to its list of individuals and companies banned for supporting Russia's actions in Ukraine, Reuters reported. EU foreign ministers are also discussing a ban on gold imports from Russia, Guardian reported.Such contradictory moves are the manifestation of the EU's dilemma. So far, the EU has imposed six rounds of sanctions against Russia, and is mulling a seventh. Josep Borrell, EU's foreign policy chief, called for ""strategic patience"" of people in EU and elsewhere as ""it may take a long time"" for the sanctions to ""have the desired effect.""But can the EU public wait? Before the sanctions have a ""desired effect,"" it is the ordinary people that will suffer. Russia's economy is still standing, but the crisis has cast a long shadow over EU economies. Leaders of EU countries face low growth and record inflation. The euro is at parity with the dollar. According to a Bloomberg report, the EU Commission is set to warn that a halt of Russia gas supplies to the EU could potentially reduce its GDP by as much as 1.5 percent.The EU is well in a position to find out that it is not that Russia cannot live without EU, but EU cannot live without Russia. EU's sanctions against Russia serve as a boomerang. After all, it is the EU public that is paying the price for the decision of policymakers. EU politicians talk in high spirits about what kinds of sanctions would hurt Russia most and that aligning with the US makes them more secure. But when the public has no gas to even take a shower or cannot buy oil and flour at the supermarket, what is the meaning of the ""security"" the EU politicians tout?Zhang Chenyang, an assistant research fellow with the Institute of EU Studies, the China Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times that the EU has been assessing and summarizing the effects of sanctions, but it does not have a clear judgment on it, and the ""desired effect"" Borrell envisioned is far too optimistic.In the issue of sanctions against Russia, the EU has played the role of US' henchman and served US' purpose of ""killing two birds with one stone."" On the one hand, the US takes advantage of the EU to weaken Russia; on the other, it is using Russia to check the EU. EU has reportedly passed Asia as the largest consumer of US crude oil for the first time in six years. The US has made a great fortune out of the Ukraine conflict, and managed to tie the EU on its chariot. In other words, the US will not only fight until the last Ukraine, but also hold EU hostage, while EU is the typical kind of being sold by the US but counting money for the US.Just on Tuesday, the Wall Street Journal published an editorial titled ""EU confronts its worst energy nightmare."" The suggestion it gave to EU, however, is never give in to the blackmailer, namely Russia. Obviously, the crisis EU is encountering and the suffering of the EU people are not in the mind of the US, and what is in US' mind is how to prolong the conflict to gain benefits.It's been five months since the Ukraine crisis started. It is unlikely that EU policymakers do not see the situation. That the EU softens sanctions on Russia banks to allow food trade can be seen as an adjustment and an effort to find a way out. Zhang noted that the most important thing the EU should do is to untie with the US and truly think about its strategy and security.",OPINION,OBSERVER,Illustration:Liu Rui/GT,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'Reuters': ('ORG', 2), 'Sberbank': ('ORG', 1), 'UMMC': ('ORG', 1), 'Guardian': ('ORG', 1), 'Bloomberg': ('ORG', 1), 'EU Commission': ('ORG', 22), 'Institute': ('ORG', 1), 'Academy': ('ORG', 1), 'Russia': ('LOC', 12), 'Ukraine': ('LOC', 1), 'US': ('LOC', 1), 'China': ('LOC', 1), 'Josep Borrell': ('PER', 1), 'Zhang Chen': ('PER', 1)}"
172,EU’s sanctions against Russia less effective; EU may not impose more,Zhang Hui,2022-07-19,"While scouring the world for alternatives to Russia natural gas to cope with a possible colder-than-usual winter, the EU is also mulling fresh sanctions against Russia, as EU foreign ministers met on Monday to discuss banning gold purchases from the country. China analysts said the EU has realized that it has failed to crush Russia even with ""maximum"" sanctions, thus more sanctions will only become less effective, and the discussions of sanctions were made as the EU faced pressure from the US and some Central and EU countries like Lithuania. Monday's discussion was about  EU's seventh round of sanctions. On the question of whether the EU will keep coming up with more rounds of sanctions against Russia, China analysts believe the key lies in whether US President Joe Biden's Democratic Party wins in Congress in November's midterm elections. EU foreign ministers were scheduled to meet to discuss fresh sanctions against Moscow on Monday, and the bloc is considering banning gold purchases from Russia, while more Russia figures could also be placed on the EU blacklist, Agence France-Presse reported on Monday. The report said Brussels is expected to hold initial discussions on sanctions on Monday, but will not make a decision on the same day.The EU's latest move was agreed at a G7 summit last month by EU members France, Germany and Italy with their counterparts from the US, Canada, Japan and the UK. However, many observers believe the new sanctions will just be symbolic. ""The impact from a ban on Russia gold imports by G7 nations is likely to be fairly limited, given that the industry already took steps to restrict Russia gold,"" said Warren Patterson, head of commodities strategy at ING Groep NV, a Dutch financial service company, noting that ""it looks as though it's largely symbolic,"" according to a Bloomberg report. Wang Yiwei, director of the Institute of International Affairs at the Renmin University of China, told the Global Times on Monday that some central and EU countries like Lithuania have attempted to kidnap the EU in imposing sanctions against Russia. Meanwhile, as the Czech Republic took over the bloc's six-month Presidency of the Council, it will continue to push the EU to sanction Russia, even though the EU knows the impact of the sanctions is getting weaker and weaker. Many EU countries have been worried that Russia could reduce or even permanently cut off gas supplies to EU, as they have not figured out a feasible plan for the upcoming tough winter. EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen was scheduled to visit Baku on Monday to seek more natural gas from Azerbaijan, Al Jazeera reported on Sunday. Klaus Müller, president of the Federal Network Agency, Germany's energy regulator, said that Germany does not currently have enough gas stored up to get through the coming winter without Russia supplies and added that a lot is riding on whether the Nord Stream 1 pipeline starts pumping again after maintenance work is completed this week, Politico reported on Sunday. While the EU is in the grip of a gas shortage and economic downturn, the bloc is also becoming incapable of fulfilling its promises of help to Ukraine. Bloomberg reported on Friday that EU foreign ministers were set to agree on 500 million euros ($506 million) more in military aid to Ukraine on Monday. However, the report said that the EU has slowed its aid to Ukraine due to its economic pain, as the EU has so far only managed to agree on an initial tranche that covers one-ninth of the target it promised to provide Ukraine in May. As for how long the EU will continue its sanctions against Russia, Wang said that the key lies with the US, as many measures require coordination with US. Meanwhile, the EU is becoming increasingly worried about the US and knows it cannot be relied on, Wang said. He noted that the EU will not be highly valued if former US president Donald Trump wins a second term. Against this backdrop, the EU is seeking cooperation with other major countries including China, and has realized that the solution to many global challenges needs China's participation, analysts said. Valdis Dombrovskis, the EU commissioner for trade, and China Vice Premier Liu He will co-chair a virtual high-level trade dialogue on Tuesday where a number of global economic challenges will be discussed, including food security and energy prices, supply chains and financial services, the China Morning Post reported on Sunday. A professor at China Foreign Affairs University told the Global Times on Monday on condition of anonymity that China is likely to stress that close China-EU cooperation not only benefits both sides, but is also conducive to solving regional or global issues, such as the Ukraine crisis. On the Ukraine crisis, both China and the EU do not want chaos or war, and want a ceasefire as soon as possible. The two sides also hold common ground on humanitarian aid, observers said. China State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi said on Sunday during a phone conversation with Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto that China is not a party directly related to the Ukraine crisis, but China hasn't sat on the sidelines, and will not add fuel to the flames. China will consistently and firmly promote dialogues and peace talks, Wang noted.Although NATO, which is manipulated by the US, expressed alarm over China on supply chains last month, the EU and NATO have a lot of different views on supply chain layout, the expert said. Economic, cultural and social exchanges are the EU's core as opposed to military elements, and the enhanced economic ties between China and the EU mean that the two sides' industrial chain can only be strengthened, but not weakened or decoupled, the expert said.",CHINA,DIPLOMACY,"Flags of the European Union fly outside the EU headquarters in Brussels, Belgium, May 21, 2021.

174,China’s role in building global democracy a shining light for developing countries: Indian scholar,Global Times,2022-07-19,"Editor's Note:For the China people, the past decade has been epic and inspirational. The country, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China (CPC) with Xi Jinping at its core, has made great endeavors in boosting its economy, deepening reforms, improving the rights of its people and acting as a responsible power globally.If using one word to describe China's changes over the past decade, it would be ""experiment,"" said India Marxist intellectual Vijay Prashad (Prashad), executive director of Tricontinental: Institute for Social Research. In an interview with Global Times (Global Times) reporters Lu Yuanzhi and Bai Yunyi, he said ""it's the highest ethic of the modern world to eradicate poverty,"" and what China has done in this regard is ""incredible.""This is the 14th article of the series about this special decade. Global Times: If you are asked to use one word to describe China's changes over the past decade, which word would you choose and why?Prashad: It would most likely be the word, experiment, because I think one of the features of China socialism since 1949 has been to experiment with attaining certain goals, like eradicating hunger and poverty, building the dignity of the people and so on.Since 1949, the China people have gone through a lot of ups and downs. And in all the ups and downs, the goal has always been to establish socialism. I think over the past 10 years, there have been a lot of very interesting experiments. The abolishment of absolute poverty is an immense success. I wouldn't say that a country like China has attained perfection, but certain things have certainly been achieved. Ecological progress has been dramatic. I'm always surprised to see the new technologies when I am in China, especially the high-speed rail. There have been some real advances. Global Times: In a previous interview with Global Times, you said that you are paying great attention to China's poverty eradication. Why do you focus on it? Prashard: I think that it's the highest ethic of the modern world to eradicate poverty, which means eradicating hunger, illiteracy and so on. It is the highest moral standing of a government. Mahatma Gandhi, the great India, said that the test of orderliness in a country is not the number of millionaires it owns, but the absence of starvation among its masses. We can update that and say a country shouldn't be judged by the number of billionaires it has, but by the absence of poverty in the country. I've been writing about hunger for years, covering stories of hunger all around the world. I think it's a very important issue, because I find it hard to be a person when people are hungry.It's incredible what China has done. Is it possible for it to be replicated? Of course. But it's not just a question of following the principles. You got to have a state that is committed to eradicating poverty as a primary goal. 

Vijay Prashad Photo: Screenshot Global Times: In recent years, the West's demonization of China, especially China's social and political systems, tends to become increasingly severe. What has triggered such a phenomenon?Prashad: Since former US president Richard Nixon visited Beijing till perhaps the presidency of Barack Obama, China was actually viewed favorably in the US. The US also viewed China production in Shenzhen and other places as being fundamental to the international industrial production chains. What changed? In my opinion, two things happened. First, China technological developments threatened the technological power of West companies. For instance, Huawei started to make phones. If Huawei makes phones that are as good as West phones, such as Apple, and if they're cheaper, they certainly threaten the market of West companies. China firms are producing as good, if not better technology, as that in the West and at a cheaper price. This is a great market threat. The West attempts to roll back China's technological developments. The US government started to say Huawei might threaten its security. But there was no proof. That was one genuine threat to West capital - China had actually attained a kind of technological parity or near parity with West technological developments. Secondly, especially after the financial crisis of 2007-08, China and EU began to enhance cooperation, and many Central and EU countries signed the Memorandum of Understanding on the Belt and Road Initiative and Italy also joined the Belt and Road Initiative. For these two reasons: advances in China technology and the historical integration of Eurasia, the US has accelerated a pressure campaign against China.Global Times: The West has also fabricated the ""China threat theory,"" attempting to isolate China on a global scale. Will the West achieve its intent? Prashad: I think that it's a very serious question.First, I think China needs to acknowledge that in terms of the information struggle, it is much weaker than the West. For instance, West media companies saturate news coverage in much of the third world. It's through Reuters, Associated Press, CNN, Fox News and so on. A lot of their ideas are refracted through world news. China media coverage doesn't have the same kind of role as the West media coverage. This has to do with the West's hundreds of years of colonialism. Second, we already have evidence now that people in other parts of the world no longer really fully believe what is coming out of the US on Ukraine. Many Africa countries, many Asia countries, and many Latin US countries are unwilling to follow along with the US storyline regarding Ukraine.There's a shift in the mood, but that's not enough. I feel that China diplomacy had been very quiet until recently. What is China's theory of what's happening in Africa? What's China's theory of what's happening in the US? These are not clear to people, but you had a West theory about what's happening in China and a West theory about what's happening in India. We need to acknowledge the fact that in the information struggle, the West remains very powerful. It's capable of driving an agenda. Take the case of the eradication of absolute poverty. Why wasn't this front-page news in every poor country in the world? Why not? The West media said that China is not honest about the numbers and that suddenly influenced the story, because they have the capacity to drive an information war.Global Times: Some are still hyping up the ""China collapse"" theory. In your opinion, does China's political and economic model have vitality? Are you optimistic about China's future?Prashad: The West has carried out a major pressure campaign against Russia and China. However, rather than seeing either Russia or China demonstrate the lines of collapse, we have seen huge partisanship or rather divisions in the US, enormous divisions between the US and EU, like between France and the US, and enormous divisions within EU. This is catastrophic. I think what's important is to caution the West to cease this pressure campaign, because rather than seeing the collapse of China or Russia, it's going to actually itself collapse.We don't want the West to collapse in a catastrophic way because that could lead to all kinds of terrible conflicts. Global Times: The West sees China as a ""one-party authoritarian"" state. What do you think about such a view? What's your take on the differences between the West and China in terms of democracy and political systems? Will history prove which one is better?Prashad: Fortunately, for US, the question isn't which one is better, but whether we will in different ways be able to attain better kinds of democracy. Again, we are all experimenting with how to get more voices heard. This is a constant struggle in any system.For most societies, not absolute monarchies, a representational government is needed. But even in absolute monarchies, there is some form of representational government. The question is, how your representation is chosen. Most societies have decided to have elections of different kinds. In fact, I would say that the processes of selecting representatives in China and in the US are not actually different in kind. They are different in degree. I don't understand why there is so much talk of democracy versus authoritarian. In fact, what I see is different forms of representational politics where people are struggling to create better democracies. We're all struggling. How can a country like the US pretend that it has the best system when the majority of women in the US want the right to choose whether or not to have an abortion, but a small number of people in a supreme court say that, no, you can't have it? How is that democratic? We're all struggling with democracy. We need a little more humility in the world, frankly. The question requires humility, not so much debate on democracy versus authoritarian. That's just noise. Global Times: Over the past decade, how has China influenced the global order? What contributions will China make in the future?Prashad: Now, the greatest impact that we see from China is that it has actually joined many multilateral bodies in order to provide better democratization for international relations. Now China is a key part of the BRICS, the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO), key part of stability in Eurasia. I think at least after the financial crisis of 2007-08, China's biggest difference has been the willingness to be involved in building a global democracy. I think it is an immense advance, because China is a powerful country in terms of its internal strength, its own advances that it has made. It's a shining light for poor people around the world.The entry of China in attempting to democratize the world system has been long overdue and I'm so glad to see China's active participation on behalf of the poorer people of the world, because it provides a counterweight to some of the West countries that negotiate on behalf of the richer people.Global Times: The Communist Party of China (CPC) is leading the China people on a new journey toward realizing the second centenary goal. What experience can other countries learn from the CPC governance ?Prashad: It's difficult to learn from a socialist experiment like China, because only a few countries remain which had a genuine socialist revolutionary process, Vietnam, China and Cuba. But I think one of the main features that can be learned is the lack of rigidity of the thinking in China. That's why I use the word experiment. You must always understand Marxism creatively. Creative Marxism is the source of our advances while rigidity is our death. You must never lose your principles. And I think that's the very important lesson. What China President Xi Jinping put on the table is the importance of the principles of socialism. And young people need to engage both the principles of Marxism creatively and experimentation. I very much hope that in the institutes of Marxist studies across China, people are able to understand the power of experimentation and to see when we allow human creativity to flourish, we can solve problems.",OPINION,VIEWPOINT,Photo: VCG,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'China': ('LOC', 9), 'India': ('LOC', 2), 'Tricontinental': ('LOC', 1), 'Communist Party of China': ('ORG', 1), 'CPC': ('ORG', 1), 'Institute for Social Research': ('ORG', 1), 'Global Times': ('ORG', 5), 'Xi Jinping': ('PER', 1), 'Vijay Prashad': ('PER', 2), 'Lu Yuanzhi': ('PER', 1), 'Bai Yunyi': ('PER', 1), 'Prash': ('PER', 1), 'Ma': ('PER', 1), 'Gandhi': ('PER', 1), 'Marxist': ('MISC', 1)}"
175,China-India negotiations shouldn’t be harassed by Western public opinion: Global Times editorial,Global Times,2022-07-19,"On Sunday, the 16th round of corps commander level meeting between China and India began at the Moldo-Chushul border meeting point on the India side. The two sides then issued a joint press release late at night on Monday, reaffirming their common desires to ""maintain the security and stability on the ground in the West Sector"" of the Line of Actual Control (LAC) and to ""stay in close contact and maintain dialogue through military and diplomatic channels.""Compared with the joint press releases issued after the previous talks, the one for the 16th round meeting particularly emphasized that the two sides continued discussions for the resolution of the relevant issues along the LAC in the West Sector in a ""constructive and forward-looking manner."" This releases a positive signal that China-India relations continue to ""warm up,"" and the two sides are working together to resolve the border dispute. The mutual trust between the two sides in resolving border issues is gradually building up again, providing the necessary atmosphere for the two countries to manage the disputes effectively.The 16th round of talks took place four months after the previous one, the longest gap between China-India military talks since the 2020 Galwan Valley border clash. The delay of the negotiations has led some West media to give the meetings an early ""diagnosis,"" saying that there is a huge ""asymmetry of power"" between India and China. They also argue that since the differences between the two sides are ""obvious,"" it was ""almost impossible to reach agreement in the discussions."" But the facts have proven that China and India are fully capable of dealing with the problems and divergences between them. The joint press release issued on Monday is an indirect response to harassment from US and West public opinion.The China-India border standoff has entered its third year, and such a state of confrontation should not continue indefinitely. But the complex border issue cannot be resolved in ""one step,"" and the concrete negotiation process faces even more difficulties and needs more time. China and India are both Asia powers capable of mobilizing national forces to engage in a border conflict. The total populations of the two countries exceed 2.8 billion. In a complex and unstable world, it is evident that keeping friction to a minimal level and maintaining enough patience with differences is more realistic and urgent for both sides than ""settling the border dispute once and for all."" This also tests the wisdom of both countries.What needs to be aware of is that there should be no cracks on the China-India border for external forces to drive a wedge. Whenever the China and India officers are ready to start negotiations, US and West public opinion will always begin a new round of mass hype. For example, they keep hyping ""India's dilemma"" or indirectly agitating New Delhi by claiming it is ""afraid of a confrontation with the superpower."" Some senior US officials have repeatedly expressed ""concerns"" over ""China's bullying of India."" These are all US's ploys to woo New Delhi and attempts to entice India due to the geopolitical need to contain China. They have certainly made some India elites feel a bit ""flattered"" for some time, with some even misinterpreting China's desire to maintain peace and stability on the China-India border as a weakness that can be exploited. This is one of the major reasons for the difficulties in current China-India relations.Therefore, India's tradition of adhering to strategic autonomy is particularly important. The Russia-Ukraine conflict has made some India elites calm down and begun to rethink where their national interests lie. Compared with the rampant nationalist sentiments in the past two years, more voices in India calling for restoring China-India relations have been emerging in recent months. In addition, India External Affairs Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar recently publicly refuted claims that view China-India relations through the prism of Russia-Ukraine conflict, saying India ""is perfectly capable of managing"" relationship with China. He made clear that he doesn't want external forces to interfere in China-India disputes. The calmness and rationality unleashed by these remarks will be proven correct and to have served India's national interests.It is worth mentioning that although the US and the West have generally taken an approach to woo India in recent years, they still cannot hide their condescending attitude. Some US media outlets recently criticized India's ""confused"" policy toward China. The article claims that ""New Delhi appears wary of Beijing but unwilling to partner with US. These contradictions leave it open to exploitation,"" and ""an economically weak and socially fragile India under Modi runs the risk of getting caught between a hammer and an anvil."" This has laid clearly bare what the US and the West have in their mind. The US-led West should be warned that India is not an iron bar to be beaten by others at will, and China will not be an anvil to squeeze India.Both China and India are emerging economies committed to economic and social development, and the common interests of the two sides far outweigh the differences. Although the border issue is difficult to resolve, it is not hard to figure out what position it should be put to best serve national interests and the common interests of the region.Human history has never seen two giant neighbors with a population of over 1 billion each like China and India developing together before. When looking at China-India relations, one should have a historical vision broader than the Himalayas. At the same time, we should resist ""public opinion harassment"" by the US and the West to make China and India be partners rather than rivals. The two should put their destiny in their own hands and realize their own national development and rejuvenation.",OPINION,EDITORIAL,China India.

176,‘Power of Siberia 2’ gas pipeline via Mongolia to further balance China’s gas import mix: experts,Chu Daye,2022-07-19,"
The ""Power of Siberia 2"" gas pipeline will benefit Russia, China and Mongolia, with the capacity to channel cleaner energy to China to help the world's second-largest economy balance its reliance on liquefied natural gas (LNG), China experts said on Tuesday.The comments came after Mongolian Prime Minister Oyun-Erdene Luvsannamsrai told the Financial Times that he expects Russia to begin construction of the ""Power of Siberia 2"" gas pipeline via Mongolia in 2024, as Moscow moves to connect its EU-supplying natural gas fields to Asia.Although construction of such pipelines usually takes years, an energy infrastructure project of this scale has huge economic and political implications, experts said, given that Russia's quarrel with its traditional customers in EU is escalating amid the Russia-Ukraine conflict.While Russia has largely refrained from using natural gas as an economic weapon, the supply of the vital fuel has increasingly become a thorny issue as the tit-for-tat escalates between Russia and the West led by the US. Reuters reported on Monday that Russia Gazprom has told its EU customers it cannot guarantee gas supplies due to ""extraordinary"" circumstances, while the key Nord Stream 1 pipeline undergoes a 10-day annual maintenance.Facing an energy crisis and economic slowdown, the EU has turned to US LNG as a relief. For the first time, EU received more US gas in the form of LNG than Russia gas. The EU intends to wean itself of Russia fossil fuels by 2027, West media reported.Planning for the ""Power of Siberia 2"" has been under discussion for years, with two alternative routes, with one entering China from the Russia Far East and a West route connected with China's Xinjiang region.Experts said having the ""Power of Siberia 2,"" which has a reported capacity of 50 billion cubic meters (bcm) annually and is expected to enter service around 2030, will give China more alternatives in terms of gas supply.Jin Lei, professor at the Beijing-based China University of Petroleum, told the Global Times on Tuesday the ""Power of Siberia 2"" will enhance China's natural gas supply, and Russia will also benefit from having an additional customer in Mongolia.China also needs to systematically expand its subterranean gas storage facilities to prepare for an increased gas import volume in the coming years, Jin said, noting that as Russia begins to ramp up pipeline gas supply to China, storage capacity is becoming an issue. China experts noted the irony in the US and the UK suggesting China could replace the EU's role as the top user of Russia gas, after they torpedoed the Nord Stream 2 project, completed last year.About half of all China's natural gas consumption is imported and about two-thirds of imported gas enters in the form of LNG. Australia accounts for 40 percent of China's LNG imports and the US for 10 percent.China is the world's largest importer of natural gas. As the shift from coal to gas continues and the nation aggressively pursues carbon neutrality, China's natural gas consumption in 2021 increased by COVID-19.9 percent to 121.36 million tons. In value terms, natural gas imports reached 360 billion yuan ($53.4 billion) in 2021, up 56.3 percent from 2020. The price for pipeline gas is deemed elatively stable. Russia gas exports to China via the ""Power of Siberia"" have continued to increase in volume, and in the first six months of this year, they were up by 63.4 percent, Sputnik reported on July 15, citing Gazprom.",SOURCE,COMPANIES,"A tanker carrying 155,000 cubic meters of LNG arrives at Zhoushan port, East China's Zhejiang Province. The facility has received 100 LNG ships since August 2018.

177,Pelosi could spark ‘more serious’ Taiwan Straits crisis; China-US ties would fall off cliff if Washington intended to crash ‘guardrails’,Yang Sheng,2022-07-19,"Once again, media has reported that US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi plans to visit Taiwan in August after an aborted April visit to Asia that might include a trip to China's island due to testing positive for COVID-19, with analysts saying that if she intends to make a blatant provocation against China, she would spark a much more dangerous incident than the Taiwan Straits Crisis in 1996, and it would cause a huge setback for China-US ties.  According to the Financial Times on Tuesday, ""six people familiar with the situation said Pelosi would take a delegation to Taiwan in August."" Just as in April, Pelosi did not make an official response to the media report as of press time, while the external affairs authority of Taiwan island said on Tuesday that they have not received relevant information about this.  But the China Foreign Ministry made a serious response to warn the US. Zhao Lijian, China Foreign Ministry spokesperson, said at a routine press conference on Tuesday that China firmly opposes official exchanges between the US and Taiwan authorities in any form. ""As an integral part of the US government, the US Congress should strictly abide by the one-China policy pursued by the US. If House Speaker Pelosi visits Taiwan, it will be a serious violation of the one-China principle and the provisions of the three China-US joint communiqués,"" Zhao said. ""China urged the US to not arrange the visit and stop official exchanges, stop creating tensions across the Taiwan Straits, and take concrete actions to fulfill the US commitment of 'not supporting Taiwan secessionism.' If the US insists on going its own way, China will take firm and forceful measures to firmly safeguard national sovereignty and territorial integrity. The US must bear all the consequence of the visit,"" Zhao said.Zhu Fenglian, spokesperson for the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council, also said on Tuesday that the Democratic Progressive Party's (DPP) authorities' attempt to collude with foreign forces to seek secession, no matter in what form, will only end in failure.The 82-year-old politician, who is third in the line of succession in the US leadership, would be the most senior US lawmaker to visit the island since one of her predecessors as Speaker, Republican Newt Gingrich, traveled to the island in 1997. But China analysts stressed that Gingrich's case is very different from Pelosi's, because Republican Gingrich was in opposition during a Democratic administration and then president Bill Clinton's administration had showed sincerity and made efforts to fix ties with China in 1997. Today, Pelosi and President Joe Biden are both Democrats, and the China-US relations are very intense. China experts said if the visit goes ahead, that would be ""strategic level provocation,"" so the response would definitely be ""not only military but also strategic,"" and the consequences would be hard for the US, which is in serious economic pressure, to bear. China needs to make its determination clear and show its strengths, and let the US side decide to avoid crisis and ensure a relatively stable situation, or make the turbulent world more chaotic.

The People's Liberation Army (PLA) air force conducted patrol training over China's island of Taiwan.(Photo: Xinhua)Serious situationPelosi postponed her trip to Asia on April 7 with the excuse of a COVID-19 infection, and on the same day, the Taiwan's ""defense authority"" said four PLA aircraft entered the island's self-proclaimed southwest air-defense identification zone, with a Y-9 electronic warfare aircraft flying to the east of the island.Also on April 7, 2022, when talking by phone with the France President's Diplomatic Counselor Emmanuel Bonne, State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi made clear China's solemn position on media reports that Pelosi would visit Taiwan.Wang pointed out that the current international situation is increasingly turbulent. On the Ukraine issue, the US stressed that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of a country should be respected, but on the Taiwan question, it openly tramples on the red line of the one-China principle, according to the website of China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs. ""This is a blatant double standard. If the US House Speaker, a political leader of the US, deliberately visits Taiwan, it would be a malicious provocation against China's sovereignty and gross interference in China's internal affairs, and would send an extremely dangerous political signal to the outside world. If the US side insists on having its own way, China will surely make a firm response and all the consequences will be borne by the US side,"" Wang said.On April 8, the China embassy in the US urged US to cancel Pelosi's trip to Taiwan. A series of diplomatic and military moves meant the crisis was avoided in April, and if the danger reemerges in August, it means Pelosi and the US decision-makers did not learn that lesson and want to test China's bottom line again, said Lü Xiang, an expert on US studies and research fellow at the China Academy of Social Sciences.""If the visit eventually happens, it would not be a miscalculation but an intentional provocation by the US side,"" Lü said, adding that maybe it is not the right time to make too much analysis as Pelosi made no clear response to the media report so far and this means that the US senior leader could cancel or postpone her trip again with other excuses after realizing the danger of her plan. The resurgence of Pelosi's planned Taiwan tour came after US government approved a proposed $108 million arms sale of technical and equipment support to the Taiwan authorities, the fifth of its kind under the Joe Biden administration. The reports come amid former US defense secretary under the Donald Trump administration Mark Esper's Taiwan tour. Song Zhongping, a military expert and TV commentator, told the Global Times that Pelosi's plan is serving the Democrats' agenda to add more leverage for the midterm elections, and she might believe that China wants a stable external environment ahead of the 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, so she dares to make a bet that China's response will not be too serious.

Photo:China MilitaryUnbearable consequences But it would be dangerous if Pelosi underestimates China's determination, analysts said. Earlier this month, Wang told US State Secretary Antony Blinken at a meeting on the sidelines of the G20 Foreign Ministers' Meeting in Indonesia that ""the three Sino-US joint communiqués are the most reliable guardrails for the two countries."" In other words, China is telling the US that as long as the US keeps away from provoking China on the Taiwan question, bilateral ties will not ""fall off a cliff,"" but if the US side wants to tell China that it disagrees with what China said about the ""guardrails"" and intends to have a try using extreme provocation, then ""we will see the China-US relations fall off a cliff, for sure,"" Lü said.The military response is definite and Pelosi, before she ends her term, might bear the ""stain"" of sparking a crisis which could be more dangerous than the 1996 Taiwan Straits Crisis, Lü noted.In June, China State Councilor and Defense Minister General Wei Fenghe said in a speech delivered at the Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore that if anyone dares to split Taiwan out of China, China will not hesitate to fight. ""We will fight at all costs. We will fight to the very end. This is the only choice for China,"" Wei said.Hu Xijin, a commentator for the Global Times, suggested the People's Liberation Army (PLA) should send military aircraft to accompany Pelosi's plane to enter the island of Taiwan and fly over the airport where Pelosi lands, and fly back to the mainland from the island, and this will make a low possibility of military conflict, and once the PLA fighter jets fly across the Taiwan island, ""this would make a precedent with a much greater milestone meaning than Pelosi's visit."" China will sooner or later send military aircraft to fly across the island to really show China's sovereignty, which is much more meaningful than any foreign politicians and officials' visits to Taiwan, Hu said, noting that China could use Pelosi's visit to realize such a step peacefully.""When sending PLA aircraft to fly across the island, we [China] must be fully prepared for an all-out military confrontation,"" and ""we have no intention to make the war to be fought now, but with no doubt, we are the one that fear the least if the war explodes now,"" Hu said. ""If the Taiwan military dares to open fire against PLA aircraft, then Taiwan military aircraft would be shot down and Taiwan military bases will be destroyed. So if the US and Taiwan authorities want all-out war, then the time for Taiwan liberation will come,"" he said.Apart from military actions in the region of the Taiwan Straits, China still has other options, Song said. ""The US, on one hand, asks for China's cooperation on issues related to Iran, North Korea and Russia, but on the other hand, keeps provoking China on core interests, so then China could have deeper cooperation with Russia, Iran and North Korea, and also strengthen cooperation with Latin US countries, including security cooperation, to reciprocate the US' challenge against China's core interests,"" Song said.The things that the US does not want to see, are exactly what China could do, and these are also important tools for China to counter the US provocations, he noted.",CHINA,POLITICS,Nancy Pelosi Photo: AFP,"Reporter, Beijing","Yang Sheng is a chief reporter at the Global Times covering Chinese politics, diplomacy and military.","{'US House': ('ORG', 2), 'Financial Times': ('ORG', 1), 'Foreign Ministry': ('ORG', 2), 'US Congress': ('ORG', 1), 'Office': ('ORG', 1), 'Council': ('ORG', 1), 'Progressive PartyPP': ('ORG', 1), 'New': ('ORG', 1), 'G': ('ORG', 2), 'P': ('ORG', 1), 'Nancy Pelosi': ('PER', 4), 'Zhao Lijian': ('PER', 3), 'Zhu Fenglian': ('PER', 1), 'Taiwan': ('LOC', 7), 'Asia': ('LOC', 1), 'China': ('LOC', 12), 'US': ('LOC', 12), 'Taiwan Straits': ('LOC', 8), 'COD': ('MISC', 1), '19': ('MISC', 1), 'Taiwan Straits Crisis': ('MISC', 1), 'Democratic': ('MISC', 1), 'Republican': ('MISC', 2)}"
178,Will political storm extend to more EU countries as inflation pressure pinches?,Global Times,2022-07-17,"Italy Minister of Foreign Affairs Luigi Di Maio warned on Friday that the turmoil engulfing Mario Draghi's government threatens to deny Ukraine vital military support in ""its fight against Russia,"" according to a Politico report. A day earlier, Italy Prime Minister Draghi tendered his resignation after the collapse of his coalition, where a key party Five Star Movement (M5S) pulled its support for Draghi's government. In general, the resignation of the head of the government of a EU country is related to the domestic situation, but diplomatic miscalculations and wrong policies - for example, Italy's tough approach against Russia - must have exacerbated his or her disadvantage. Italy's support for Ukraine along with other EU countries and the step-by-step increase in sanctions against Russia are detrimental to solving domestic problems in Italy. Under the leadership of Draghi, Italy has taken a tough line against Russia including cutting its reliance on Russia gas imports to 25 percent, from about 40 percent at the start of the year. The embargo on Russia crude oil and petroleum products imposed by West countries has led to soaring global energy prices, which have become a problem that engulfed many countries, causing higher production and living costs as well as increasing pressure on ordinary people in many EU states, including Italy. Italy's annual inflation rate rose to 8 percent in June, the highest level since it was at 8.2 percent in 1986, according to Italy national statistics agency, saying energy was the driver of the soaring prices. But Draghi apparently attached more importance to the conflict in Ukraine, saying in April that ""Do we want to have peace or do you want to have the air conditioning on?"" After Draghi offered to step down, Di Maio claimed that the attack on Draghi from Giuseppe Conte, current party leader of M5S, is ""helping Vladimir Putin's propaganda and autocracy over democracy."" This is absurd and an irresponsible use of external enemies to defuse an internal crisis. The Italy government's crisis could set a bad example in EU, after which other EU leaders are likely to be in a similar situation. In June, France President Emmanuel Macron lost his parliamentary majority with rising cost of living one of the factors. There's no doubt that the political cohesion in many EU countries has been disrupted as their policies regarding the Russia-Ukraine crisis have been kidnapped by the US. The turmoil and strife in their legislative and executive bodies rise while majority parties are weakened. If EU countries continue to blindly follow the US' policy, their political leaders should be prepared to face consequences. What makes the formation of stable governing majorities ever more difficult is that the EU integration process has become a tool of US global strategy, since EU is tying itself too tightly to US. The integration has instead become a major cause of EU division, which no one had expected. More countries and people in EU are questioning the vision of EU integration, giving rise to nationalists and populists in those states. Voices supporting integration weaken gradually, while voices from opposing political parties and the public that support nationalism getting louder. This indicates that EU is on the edge of another danger. If the situation worsens, in the end, the EU integration vision that unites regional countries will eventually fail. Or even worse, the continent could fall into conflicts as a result.The politics of EU member states are contagious: A crisis in one country will soon spread to others, and the rise of the right wing will quickly expand beyond borders, and even the US may not be able to escape such a general trend.

State Councilor and Foreign Minister, Wang Yi, had in-person meetings with India Minister of External Affairs, Subrahmanyam Jaishankar, on March 25 during Wang's visit to India and on July 7 at sidelines of the G20 foreign ministers' meeting.Since March this year, China and India have maintained communication and exchanges, effectively managed differences and a momentum of recovery has been shown in the overall bilateral relations between the two countries with common interests and similar legitimate claims, Wang said after the July meeting.Jaishankar said that both sides have made positive progress in maintaining border stability, promoting practical cooperation and facilitating people-to-people exchanges since their meeting in March.Qian Feng, Director of the Research Department of the National Strategy Institute at Tsinghua University, told the Global Times on Sunday that the ""most dangerous"" moment in bilateral relations has passed.Through joint efforts, China-India relations have gained upward momentum since the clashes at the Galwan Valley. The overall atmosphere is positive, Qian said.Although the previous two rounds of commander-level talks in 2022 did not achieve a major breakthrough, it is worth noting that both sides have insisted on relying on existing bilateral channels to resolve border issues through dialogue and communication, the expert said.Not long ago, when Jaishankar visited EU, he also publicly stated that both China and India are committed to solving problems through dialogue. He emphasized the two sides have the ability to solve their own affairs, sending a clear signal against a third party intervention.The two sides are also trying hard to prevent frictions from escalating into conflicts. China and India continue to narrow differences through dialogue and release positive signals to avoid the recurrence or intensification of conflicts, according to observers.The border issue, if unsettled, will always be a source of risk for the normal development of bilateral relations, Qian said. But because of the complicated situation, it may still take some time for the two sides to figure out a solution that both agree on.The expert also pointed out China and India's similar position on the Russia-Ukraine conflict is actually a resemblance in understanding of the world situation and major issues as two emerging major powers with large populations.The position of both India and China on the Russia-Ukraine conflict differentiates them from the West, indicating that the two countries have similarities in their international interests, which will help both sides to view border issues with a more positive approach and a vision beyond the Himalayas during the border talks, Qian stressed.",CHINA,DIPLOMACY,Picture description not found,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'VCGChina': ('ORG', 1), 'The Print': ('ORG', 1), 'Defense Ministry': ('ORG', 1), 'External Affairs': ('ORG', 1), 'Research Department': ('ORG', 1), 'National Strategy Institute': ('ORG', 1), 'Tsinghua University': ('ORG', 1), 'Global Times': ('ORG', 1), 'EU': ('ORG', 1), 'India': ('LOC', 11), 'China': ('LOC', 7), 'Chushul': ('LOC', 1), 'Moldo': ('LOC', 1), 'West Sector': ('LOC', 1), 'Line of': ('MISC', 1), 'Control': ('MISC', 1), 'G20': ('MISC', 1), 'G': ('MISC', 1), 'Wang Yi': ('PER', 3), 'Subrahmanyam Jaishankar': ('PER', 2), 'Qian Feng': ('PER', 1), 'Qi': ('PER', 1), 'Jai': ('PER', 1)}"
180,China is a partner who brings cooperation with Europe: Hungarian FM Peter Szijjarto,Global Times,2022-07-18,"China Hungary Photo:VCG
The Ukraine crisis has not only seriously impacted EU, its negative spillover effects have also affected the whole world, China State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi said on Sunday during a phone conversation with Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto. At the Group of 20 foreign ministers' meeting held recently, all sides expressed deep concerns over the issue, and China has proposed initiatives to tackle the food and energy security issues, Wang said.Wang called on all the parties to have discussions on building a balanced, effective, and sustainable EU security framework to realize lasting peace and security for the long term.During the phone conversation initiated by the Hungarian side, Wang said China is not a party directly related to the Ukraine crisis but China hasn't sat on the sidelines, and will not add fuel to the flames. China will consistently and firmly promote dialogue and peace talks, Wang noted.China has never been an opponent of EU but a partner who brings opportunities for cooperation, Szijjarto said. Hungary will remain committed to promoting EU-China cooperation based on mutual respect, equality and mutual benefit, Szijjarto noted.Hungary is pleased about the achievements of the bilateral cooperation in various fields, in particular the smooth progress of cooperation in trade and investment, Szijjarto said. Hungary is ready to maintain high-level exchanges with China and promote bilateral comprehensive strategic partnership to a new level. Hungary welcomes China enterprises to invest in Hungary and will provide convenience and a good environment.China will continue to unswervingly pursue a friendly policy toward Hungary and keep an open mind to a mutually beneficial cooperation, supporting China enterprises to invest in Hungary, Wang said. It's hoped that Hungary will provide stable policy prospect and a sound business environment, Wang noted. We believe that Hungary will continue to uphold an objective and fair position and push for the EU to adopt a positive and pragmatic policy toward China, Wang said.The EU and China are expected to hold an online high-level meeting on trade on Tuesday, according to media reports.",CHINA,SOCIETY,Picture description not found,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'China Hungary': ('LOC', 23), 'Ukraine': ('LOC', 2), 'VCG': ('ORG', 1), 'EU': ('ORG', 6), 'Group of 20': ('ORG', 1), 'Wang Yi': ('PER', 8), 'Peter Szijjarto': ('PER', 4), 'Hungarian': ('MISC', 2)}"
181,US should reflect on warnings of recession,Wang Wen,2022-07-18,"The US Consumer Price Index (CPI) increased 9.1 percent year-on-year in June, the highest rate in almost 41 years and way above estimations. In fact, in the past six months, the US inflation rate has exceeded 7 percent, 8 percent, and 9 percent successively. Many economists already believe that the US economy has fallen into a technical recession.There are three main reasons for surging US inflation. First, two and a half years since the beginning of COVID-19 epidemic, supply chains in EU and the US have been facing great pressure. E-commerce orders are surging, while intermittent isolation and lockdown measures led to a notable rise in logistics costs and, consequently, the soaring of commodity prices.Second, for more than two years, central banks in developed countries, especially the US, have adopted the monetary policy of ""super"" quantitative easing, resulting in more money printed and then currency devaluation.Third, driven by the Russia-Ukraine conflict, the prices of commodities, particularly energy, have risen. For example, energy prices in the US grew 41.6 percent over the last year, and gasoline prices soared nearly 59.9 percent year-on-year. Now, central banks in many countries are facing a dilemma. On one hand, they want to ""stabilize growth"" and maintain an economic growth rate in a certain way, which requires credit and investment expansion. On the other hand, these countries must now ""fight inflation,"" which demands raising interest rates to tighten credit further. Now, it seems that many central banks have been forced to give priority only to ""fight inflation."" Economists generally predict that if relevant policies are not put in place, inflation in the US and many other developed countries will still be far from its peak: It may rise again in July and August. This has made most people in the economic community pessimistic about the future of the US economy. Since March, the US Federal Reserve has increased interest rates three times, with the target range for the federal funds rate raised to 1.5 percent-1.75 percent. More and more people are predicting that the Fed will approve a significant 75 basis-point hike to interest rates in July, while some even say it could be 100 basis points. This will inevitably drag down US' economic growth further. Real GDP in the US fell at an annual rate of 1.6 percent in the first quarter of 2022, and the US economy will likely continue to go downward in the second quarter. This means that it is quite possible that the US economy will not only fall into a technical recession, but also into a medium- to long-term recession. This, in turn, will heighten the sense of nervousness that the entire developed world is entering a recession.However, we are pleased to see that starting in July, the US and EU are lifting some of their sanctions against Russia, and China-US trade talks on tariffs will begin. If the easing of sanctions and trade negotiations can continue, it should effectively control inflation. We hope that inflation will remind developed countries, especially the US, that they need to learn from some of these major lessons.Lesson one - They should adopt a responsible fiscal and monetary policy. In response to the 2008 global financial crisis, the US pursued the coordination of macroeconomic financial policies. This tradition should be revived. Currently, it is difficult to achieve a soft landing in any crisis without thinking from the perspective of global cooperation.Lesson two - They need to conduct effective and peaceful negotiations. Russia and Ukraine should be encouraged to negotiate with each other. The biggest obstacle to such talks now comes from the US. If US doesn't want the conflict to stop, it will surely suffer from the backlash of inflation and economic depression due to the conflict between Moscow and Kiev.Lesson three - They must enhance practical and international cooperation to combat COVID-19 epidemic. Only when the epidemic ends as soon as possible can logistics costs and the economy possibly return to normal.In short, it is now time for the US to reflect on itself. Without reflection and policy reversion, the US economy will be in even greater trouble.The author is executive dean of Chongyang Institute for Financial Studies at Renmin University of China. opinion@globaltimes.com.cn",OPINION,COLUMNISTS,Illustration:Chen Xia/GT,Author title not found,Wang Wen is professor and executive dean of Chongyang Institute for Financial Studies at Renmin University of China.,"{'US Consumer Price Index': ('MISC', 1), 'CPI': ('MISC', 1), 'COVID - 19': ('MISC', 1), 'Russia': ('MISC', 1), 'US': ('LOC', 12), 'Ukraine': ('LOC', 1), 'EU': ('ORG', 1), 'Reserve': ('ORG', 1), 'Fed': ('ORG', 1)}"
182,"Pragmatism critical for China, EU to address pressing economic challenges",Wang Jiamei,2022-07-18,"The EU and China will hold a high-level trade dialogue on Tuesday, which is expected to focus on discussions of a number of global economic challenges, including food security and energy prices, supply chains, financial services, and bilateral trade and investment concerns, the China Morning Post reported on Monday, citing a EU Commission representative.At a time when there is great uncertainty in the global economic outlook, it is encouraging for China and the EU to have the opportunity to sit down and discuss specific economic and trade issues, which could also be deemed as a positive signal for bilateral relations.There is no denying that the relationship between China and the EU has encountered twists and turns amid major international developments, such as the China-US tensions, COVID-19 pandemic, and the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Yet, it is perhaps the grim economic prospect that is actually increasing the urgency for China and the EU to put aside their differences and seek practical cooperation and win-win results.Last week, the euro briefly fell below parity with the US dollar. While it was a rarity unseen in the past two decades, the euro's continued weakness these days came as no surprise. The Eurozone is mired in multiple economic predicaments including high inflation, volatile energy supply due to the Ukraine crisis, and a growing risk of recession.Eurozone inflation surged to a record high of 8.6 percent in June, the highest ever, with nearly half of the member countries in the bloc reaching double-digit inflation, according to data from Eurostat. Moreover, the EU Commission has cut its forecast for EU economic growth in 2023 to merely 1.3 percent, far lower than the previous 2.3 percent estimate.The economic challenges facing China are significant too. Due to severe COVID-19 resurgences, China's GDP grew 0.4 percent year-on-year in the second quarter, the slowest pace since the coronavirus outbreak in 2020. It is undeniable that the slow growth rate in the second quarter will make it harder for China to achieve its annual growth target of 5.5 percent.At this juncture, it is crucial that China and the EU sit down and have a pragmatic dialogue. The past few years saw a shift in the relationship between China and the EU, with an apparent cooling in their cooperation in investment, trade and financial areas. To expand bilateral trade ties and resume constructive cooperation, the two sides need to build a consensus on pragmatism. In other words, if both sides have the willingness to seek pragmatic cooperation based on mutual respect and benefit, then China-EU economic and trade cooperation should be free of impact of the US-led ideological confrontation.Specifically, it means EU cannot provoke China's core interests. There are differences between China and the EU when it comes to human rights and democracy issues, which is understandable but should not affect practical economic cooperation. Also, individual EU members should not hold hostage the interests of the entire EU by extending their conflict with China to the bloc.China and the EU have always been important trading and investment partners, with strong resilience and vitality in bilateral trade despite the pandemic. It would be regrettable if anyone turns a blind eye to the resilience, especially at a time of great economic challenges facing both sides.China-EU economic and trade cooperation needs pragmatism, which not only serves the core interests of both sides, but also creates conditions for both sides to resolve their most pressing economic issues.The author is an editor with the Global Times. bizopinion@globaltimes.cn",SOURCE,ECONOMY,Photo: VCG,"Reporter, Shanghai","Global Times reporter covering global political economy and development, international trade and investment.","{'China Morning Post': ('ORG', 1), 'EU Commission': ('ORG', 9), 'Eurozone': ('ORG', 2), 'Eurostat': ('ORG', 1), 'China': ('LOC', 10), 'US': ('LOC', 2), 'Russia': ('LOC', 1), 'Ukraine': ('LOC', 2), 'COVID - 19': ('MISC', 2)}"
183,G20 platform should be given full play to deal with global crises,Global Times,2022-07-18,"Due to COVID-19 pandemic, geopolitical crisis, and the division in the global production chain, supply chain, value chain, and the drastic shift of monetary policy in the US and other developed economies, the world is in the midst of a global systemic crisis.The severity and harm of this worldwide systemic crisis have been rare since World War II. It is a general outbreak of the accumulation and superposition of various global conflicts in the past 80 years, which can be seen from several aspects.  First, the process of globalization is facing major challenges. The globalization process is undergoing deep adjustments, in which regional characteristics in globalization and political factors in economic and trade relationships are increasing. In particular, with rapid development of information technology and the fourth industrial revolution coming, international competitions have extended from geopolitics and security to overall industrial competitions. Major economies' competition around industrial chains has been rising. The pandemic has driven relief funds in West countries to flow to big companies, helping them adjust industrial chain layout and join international competition and realize geopolitical goals. Unfortunately, some countries, out of their own selfish interests, are attempting to build a small circle to raise the risk of confrontation. The so-called Indo-Pacific Economic Framework is based on the design of an exclusive economic structure. Second, the global economy is heading for recession and may trigger a new financial crisis. Recently, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) announced that it had lowered its 2022 economic growth forecast for the US to 2.3 percent. Kristalina Georgieva, managing director of the IMF, clearly pointed out that the US has a ""narrowing path"" to avoid recession. While downgrading the US economic growth rate, the IMF has made it clear that it will further reduce the global economic growth rate in 2022.The IMF currently forecasts a global economic growth rate of 3.6 percent. The IMF is reported to ""substantially"" cut global growth outlook this year. It may be close to the 2.9 percent global economic growth in 2022 recently announced by the World Bank. As we all know, if the global economic growth forecast is lower than 3 percent, it usually means that the global economy is on the brink of recession.Third, the energy crisis and food crisis. In February, before the outbreak of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, the world had already seen rising energy prices and food prices. The Russia-Ukraine conflict and the West's sanctions against Russia, as well as Russia's counter-sanctions, have further exacerbated this crisis. According to the statistics of the UN, in 2020, 928 million people in the world were suffering from severe food shortages, which is expected to worsen in 2022. In terms of the energy crisis, although the US and some West countries have taken practical measures, including the release of 1 million barrels of crude oil reserves in the US every day, and the periodic reduction of gasoline taxes and other measures, but currently we see oil prices still hovering at a high of $110 a barrel. In this case, the US and West countries will also increase sanctions on Russia's energy, including restricting the price of Russia energy in the market.It can be clearly seen that the world is currently experiencing serious negative impacts during the process of globalization, and industrial, supply, and value chains are affected by the division of values. The global economy is on the verge of recession and may trigger a global financial crisis. The geopolitical crisis has further exacerbated the global food crisis and energy crisis.In the face of the most serious systemic crisis since the end of World War II, all countries in the world need to realize the urgency, severity and importance of the task of maintaining peace and development. With the spirit of peaceful coexistence, mutual benefit and win-win results, major economies need to carry out timely policy communication and coordination. The G7 mechanism has been proven by history to be unable to reflect the spirit of the times, and unable to unite the global response to crises. The only effective channel is the G20 mechanism.The article was compiled based on a speech delivered by Zhu Guangyao, former China Vice Minister of Finance, at the fifth World Finance Forum. bizopinion@globaltimes.com.cn",SOURCE,ECONOMY,Illustration: Chen Xia/Global Times,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'COVID': ('MISC', 1), '19': ('MISC', 1), 'World War II': ('MISC', 1), 'West': ('MISC', 2), 'Indo - Pacific': ('MISC', 1), 'Framework': ('MISC', 1), 'US': ('LOC', 4), 'World': ('LOC', 1), 'Russia': ('LOC', 2), 'Ukraine': ('LOC', 2), 'Economic': ('ORG', 1), 'International Monetary Fund': ('ORG', 1), 'IMF': ('ORG', 3), 'IMFMF': ('ORG', 1), 'Bank': ('ORG', 1), 'Kristalina Georgieva': ('PER', 1)}"
184,"EU should care for own interests, not to be 'exploited by US': Chinese experts",GT staff reporters,2022-07-18,"Against the background of ricocheting regional tensions, such as the Ukraine-Russia conflict, China and EU deliver a signal of maintaining economic cooperation by reportedly planning to hold a high-level dialogue on Tuesday.China experts said that the EU should not be ""exploited by the US"" and hold a hostile policy toward China, at a time when the EU is mired in severe inflation, malfunctioning supply chains and economic slowdown.According to the China Morning Post (SCMP), the EU will hold a high-level trade dialogue with China on Tuesday after months of delay. Valdis Dombrovskis, the EU commissioner for trade, and China Vice Premier Liu He will co-chair the virtual dialogue, which will also include representatives from the trade and economic ministries of both sides, according to the SCMP report.The report cited a EU Commission representative as saying that a number of global economic challenges will be discussed during the dialogue, including food security and energy prices, supply chains, financial services, and bilateral trade and investment concerns.Experts said that holding the meeting reflects the two sides' shared willingness to keep China-EU relations stable and resilient despite a volatile geopolitical situation, by striving to keep the bilateral mechanism running normally. ""The more difficult the situation is, the more significant the two sides hold discussions. Otherwise, both sides will become victims of international political wrestling,"" Cui Hongjian, director of the Department of EU Studies at the China Institute of International Studies, told the Global Times.According to Cui, China and the EU need to join hands to tackle the negative economic impact of the Ukraine crisis. In particular, they should work together to address some urgent problems facing them.For example, the EU has been talking about the urgency of supply chain security, but the achievement of such a goal shouldn't be equated with excluding China from the EU's supply chains, like some have proposed, Cui said.As China and EU have deep economic ties in many aspects, the two sides will need to support each other on many economic issues. For example, at a time when global grain prices are fluctuating, China and the EU should make sure that the two sides cooperate to stabilize grain supply. And, they should think of ways to ensure global grain security by jointly addressing the negative impact of current conflicts on global grain prices, which will also bring benefits to many countries. Some experts stressed that China-EU cooperation is significant for EU, whose economy is facing severe problems and has risks of falling into a deeper recession if it blindly follows in the steps of the US by countering China.The EU is facing grave challenges, Li Yong, deputy chairman of the Expert Committee of the China Association of International Trade, a think tank affiliated with the China Ministry of Commerce, told the Global Times on Monday.Global inflation is elevated, driven by surging energy and food prices. Against the background of interest rate hikes by the US Federal Reserve, a EU debt crisis has emerged and the euro has depreciated, Li said.

Inflation continues to rise across EU.Graphic:Huo Siyu/GTHu Qimu, chief research fellow at the Sinosteel Economic Research Institute, told the Global Times on Monday that the EU is very likely to slide into recession by relying on its own economic cycle. Therefore, it is necessary for EU to strengthen cooperation with China．As for why the trade dialogue was delayed for several months, China experts said that the main reason is that the EU believed in the US energy commitment, stood firmly on the US side and held high the banner of sanctions against Russia. ""It should be said that the outbreak and continuation of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine is a strategic mistake made by the EU. The EU was exploited by the US and lost everything. In the end, it must return to the road of cooperation and negotiation with China,"" Hu said. China and EU have already enhanced communication recently over multiple issues. On Sunday, China State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi and Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto talked over the phone about bilateral ties and the Ukraine crisis. Wang said that the Ukraine crisis has not only seriously affected EU - its negative spillover has also affected the world.The lessons from the Ukraine crisis are profound and worth learning for all sides, Wang noted, saying that in the long run, the parties should discuss building a balanced, effective, and sustainable EU security framework, so as to realize lasting peace and security.Cui said that although the dialogue is unlikely to generate many detailed projects in the short term, it would be good progress if the two sides can achieve some intention of cooperation.

187,China’s wisdom prevails in Middle East: former Egyptian diplomat,Global Times,2022-07-17,"Editor's Note:During the past decade, the world has increasingly witnessed a trend of ""the East is rising, and the West is declining"" in the spheres of economy, security and discourse power. West countries, particularly the US, plagued by internal woes, have sought the old path of passing the buck and instigating turmoil elsewhere to ease their own pressure. China, representative of the emerging countries, is proposing new solutions to global problems. By advocating win-win development, facilitating consultation and reconciliation and proposing a balanced and effective security mechanism, China is striving to build a community with a shared future for mankind.In the sixth piece of the series, Ali el-Hefny, Egypt's former ambassador to China and former deputy foreign minister, told Global Times (Global Times) reporters Yu Jincui and Lu Yuanzhi that in the Middle East, where the situation is chaotic and volatile, there is a need for engagement by world powers, mainly China, to help the region recover stability, peace and security and China's role is particularly needed in the reconstruction of devastated countries such as Syria, Libya, Iraq, Yemen and Lebanon.Global Times: You once said no one is in the position to play the role of a ""human rights preacher"" to teach China how to maintain regional peace and stability. Any attempt to play the role of preacher was aimed at putting pressure on China. Can you elaborate it? el-Hefny: Yes. No nation or group of nations has the right to teach others for several reasons. First, these nations or organizations lack the necessary credentials to assume that role. There is no unanimity about that. Second, they lack credibility as they apply double standards. They are not just or fair and their score is even negative as far as human rights at their home are concerned. Third, support to flagrant human rights violations in some nations make their bullying approaches regarding other nations groundless and doubtful when it comes to their real intentions toward the later. Fourth, each and every one of our nations knows better about circumstances prevailing in our places and doesn't need advices of those nations.The stances of those countries you mentioned have, I wouldn't say a hidden agenda, but a clear agenda regarding China in general and the situation in Xinjiang in particular, they fear the rise of China and feel that the competition with China has gone too far and that they are not able anymore to cope with China's advances in almost fields. Those countries do their best to tarnish China's image and credibility worldwide, in particular.After the launch of the Belt and Road Initiative, it has achieved big success and received widespread appeal. China's wisdom prevailed once again. The key word here is fear - their fear of what China could become by 2050and to which extent their weight and role could accomplish. Global Times: When China President Xi Jinping met Egypt President Abdel-Fattah al-Sisi, who attended the opening ceremony of the Beijing Winter Olympic Games in February, Xi Jinping said that the comprehensive cooperative partnership between China and Egypt sets an example for China's win-win cooperation with Arabian, Africa and developing countries. How do you comment on the development of bilateral relations over the past 10 years and what's your expectation for the future bilateral relations? el-Hefny: Egypt and China enjoy a lot of similarities, that has been so obvious since their two leaders took over as president. They have both almost identical and profound appreciation of world politics. Their mutual understanding got deeper and deeper over the past few years. They met many times and developed mutual understanding, in particular with regard to the priority that should be given to sustainable development in their nations, to the building up of their economies, to striving to aim at raising the standards of living of their people and to the preservation of our two nations' national security, peace and stability, because any country, if it's stable and strong from within, no other country could threaten its peace and stability. To give an example, President Xi Jinping made it a top priority to eradicate poverty in China, President al-Sisi launched an unprecedented campaign to raise the standards of living for almost 60 million Egyptians living in the countryside, in almost 4,500 villages. The campaign's name is Haya Karima, meaning ""decent life."" The two presidents have the political will to work together to develop further and further their two nations' bilateral relations, this is beneficial for the two nations and the two peoples. The presidents are willing to work together to further develop Arab-China relations, Africa-China relations and our mutual relations with other developing nations. Both countries are focused on the idea of creating a joint future because we have a common destiny. Both countries are focused on common human challenges and the need to become self-sufficient and developing while deepening our mutual assistance and interdependence, especially in the face of climate change threats, food crisis, water scarcity, combating world pandemic, etc.

Ali el-Hefny Photo: Courtesy of el-HefnyGT: The ""Arab Spring"" movement promoted by the US also affected Egypt. What's your take on the US-led ""democracy movement?"" What lessons does it teach the Arab world?el-Hefny: The Arab Spring caused a great deal of damage to Arab economies and a lot of pain to the Arab people. The whole Arab region is in chaos, wars persist, terrorism and violence have prevailed, millions of people have been displaced, emigrated, killed, and injured and infrastructure has been badly damaged. Countries were saved after a period of chaos, thanks to the awareness of our people and the important role played by their armed forces to reestablish order. I do not see any democracy established through the Arab Spring. After all, democracy cannot be enforced by foreign powers, it's the task of our leaders, governments and our people and we are all busy working on that.Global Times: The US and West media view the development of normal relations between China and the Middle Eat as ""China's challenge to US dominance"" in the region. They hyped that China is filling the power vacuum brought about by the US withdrawal from the Middle East. Why does the growing relationship between China and the Middle East upset the US and the West? What do you think of their mentality?  el-Hefny: As far as China is concerned, we have always maintained the best relations because there is a historical background and cultural aspects count a lot. They are based on mutual respect, understanding and trust, as well as mutual assistance, mainly in times of crisis as was proven through our cooperation in combating COVID-19. And for the first time practical trilateral Egypt-China-Africa cooperation was demonstrated as China provided the knowhow to Egypt and both cooperated in the production of vaccines for the people of Egypt and Africa. This success story doesn't necessarily please some powers, but they do for our people. Global Times: Many developing countries have expressed different positions from that of the US and EU on Russia-Ukraine conflicts, such as Egypt and the Gulf countries. What are the implications? Does this represent a new trend?el-Hefny: As far as the Ukraine war is concerned, as Egypt enjoys an excellent relationship with Russia and Ukraine and with their people, many interests are at stake. We really wish that the countries will put an end to hostilities the fastest possible as the persistence of war will drain further the two sides' economies. We hope they will settle their differences diplomatically. We in the region, I mean, Egypt and the Gulf states, like the rest of the world, are also facing the alarming ramifications of that war from different angles, mainly through the food crisis, supply chain disturbances and inflationary effects, etc. We are observing a balanced position, not taking any side and through our good relations with both sides, we exert every effort to encourage both sides to reach an agreement on how to settle their differences. The unilateral sanctions do not help to bring an end to the war in Ukraine. They just make it more complicated. We just hope that the war will not get out of control through miscalculations and irresponsible policies.Global Times: China has been supporting Middle Eastern countries in enhancing their strategic autonomy, encouraging regional countries to get rid of the interference from major power competition, and explore a development path with Middle Eastern characteristics. What does this mean for maintaining regional stability and achieving regional development?el-Hefny: For the Middle East where the situation is chaotic and volatile, we need the engagement of world powers, mainly China, to help recover stability, peace and security. We need greater engagement to help find political settlements to regional crises, to encourage regional and external powers to halt their attempts to destabilize further the region and to halt their hegemony and their expansionist policies. We need China's role in the reconstruction of the devastated countries and regions such as Syria, Libya, Iraq, Yemen, Lebanon and the Gaza Strip. Finally, we need China to strive to create an international community with shared values to prevail in the Middle East. We need, with China's help, to work together to go back to the path of mutual respect, peace and security and work on achieving sustainable development. That is rewarding for all our people. Global Times: How do you evaluate the establishment of a China-Arab community with a shared future? el-Hefny: It's very important to stress the establishment of a China-Arab community with a shared future and the coming Arab-China Summit in Kingdom of Saudi Arabia will be a golden opportunity to agree on and shape up a plan for more development of the bilateral relations. Those relations gained a lot of momentum during those last two decades in particular since the creation of the China-Arab States Cooperation Forum. These mutual interests have been established, but the horizons for further cooperation are quite wide and extremely promising.The two sides could play an important role in reestablishing order, peace, security and stability in those countries that have been devastated. It is in the interest of both sides.",OPINION,VIEWPOINT,LNG ships sailing in Suez Canal Photo: VCG,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'East': ('LOC', 1), 'West': ('LOC', 2), 'US': ('LOC', 1), 'China': ('LOC', 11), 'Egypt': ('LOC', 1), 'Middle East': ('LOC', 2), 'Syria': ('LOC', 1), 'Libya': ('LOC', 1), 'Iraq': ('LOC', 1), 'Yemen': ('LOC', 1), 'Lebanon': ('LOC', 1), 'Ali el - Hefny': ('PER', 2), 'Yu Jincui': ('PER', 1), 'Lu Yuanzhi': ('PER', 1), 'Hef': ('PER', 1), 'Global Times': ('ORG', 3), 'Xi': ('MISC', 1)}"
188,Heavy weapons deliveries to Ukraine heighten risks of World War III: German MP,Global Times,2022-07-17,"Editor's Note:  The Germany government recently published a complete list of weapons system and other military support delivered to Ukraine, despite calls within the country for more diplomatic efforts instead of arms deliveries to end the ongoing crisis. One of them is from Sevim Dagdelen (Dagdelen), a Germany politician and a member of the Left Party. In an interview with Global Times (Global Times) reporter Wang Wenwen, she said that sending increasingly heavy weapons to Ukraine heightens the risks of the conflict spilling over into World War III and that it is Germany people that are suffering. She also shed light on what a security architecture EU should pursue, as well as China-EU relations. Global Times: In June, Germany approved armaments worth 350 million euros ($353 million) to Ukraine. But you called for more diplomatic efforts instead of arms deliveries. What impact do anti-war voices like yours have? What kind of diplomatic efforts are you calling for?Dagdelen: Germany, like many other West countries, has supplied heavy weapons to Ukraine on a grand scale. And alongside my party Die Linke, I have spoken out against arms deliveries from the very start, because we think they will prolong the war and loss of life in Ukraine.The deliveries of increasingly heavy weapons to Ukraine in ever greater numbers, as well as the training of Ukraine service personnel, heighten the risk of the war spilling over into World War III. That concern is shared by two-thirds of the Germany population. So, we are not isolated at all in this question.Wars are fought with weapons, but ended by negotiations. Led by the US and UK, the West is putting its faith in a proxy war and a war of attrition. The aim is to weaken Russia for the long term and to achieve that, the West is willing to accept tens of thousands of deaths and limitless suffering, as well as the destruction of Ukraine.The extension of the economic war means we are actually pursuing economic suicide at the moment, committed by the Germany government through the sanctions against Russia. We need serious diplomatic efforts in pursuit of a negotiated solution, as was already within sight at the negotiations in Istanbul in end of March. And the longer the war lasts, the more terrible will be its effects, not only on the people in Ukraine, but on people around the world, as the current food crisis demonstrates.Global Times: As the Ukraine crisis drags on, Germany citizens have to brace themselves for dramatically rising costs of gas. How do you see the fact that the interests of ordinary people are jeopardized by those behind the Ukraine crisis?Dagdelen: The economic war with Russia is jeopardizing Germany's entire prosperity model. The West sanctions have not ended the war. Instead, they are acting like a boomerang. They are hitting US, the people and industry in Germany. After all, Russia's revenue from energy exports, despite falling sales and volumes, is higher than a year ago, thanks to the sanctions having driven up the prices. So, the price of these nonsensical sanctions is being paid by the general public who are suffering high inflation and exploding energy and food costs, while the oil corporations and arms companies are making profits.Should gas deliveries from Russia cease, we will face a disaster in Germany such as we have not known since the global economic crisis during the Weimar Republic. It has been calculated that in the event of stopping Russia gas deliveries, Germany's economic output would plummet by more than 12 percent in the subsequent six months. And more than 5.6 million jobs would be at risk. So, the Germany government must immediately end the suicidal economic war for the good of the people of Germany.Global Times: NATO's supposed goal is to safeguard peace and security in EU. But judging from the Ukraine crisis and what happened in Afghanistan and other countries, do you think NATO is bringing peace or uncertainty to EU and the world?Dagdelen: The planned enlargement of NATO to accept Finland and Sweden demonstrates, once again, that this is a vast military pact of an expansionist nature, and all the promises that the West made to Russia were nothing but lies. Although nothing can justify Russia's war of aggression in Ukraine, NATO bears some of the responsibility for the development of the conflict. So even Pope Francis found that ""NATO's barking at Russia's gate"" had played a role.So NATO's US-led wars around the world, from the attack on Yugoslavia in 1999, 20 years in Afghanistan with more than 200,000 killed Afghans and several war crimes and the destruction of Libya, show that NATO is not a defensive alliance, but the world's largest war machine. And NATO countries pursue economic and geopolitical interests without consideration. That's why we need a security architecture in EU for the security and certainty of the people in EU, which includes the EU countries. We cannot change the geography. Russia is part of EU and we have to deal with it.  The other thing is the enlargement of NATO and its strategic concept now. NATO is called the NATO. Now, in its strategic concept, NATO takes into focus the Indo-Pacific region. The India Ocean or the Pacific Ocean is far away from the north Atlantic. 

Sevim Dagdelen Photo:Courtesy of DagdelenGT: What is the biggest hindrance to the EU's objective of achieving strategic autonomy right now?Dagdelen: The EU has existential interests in not letting itself be drawn into the conflict between the great nuclear powers like the US, Russia and China. This will require an autonomous foreign and security policy, independent from US. And the principal goal must be to ensure that our continent does not become a nuclear battlefield. And most urgently, the states of EU need to push for a swift end to the conflict in Ukraine, and at all costs prevent the conflict from spreading.The interests of EU and EU countries and the interests of the US fundamentally diverge on this point. Because as the latter is prepared to fight to the last Ukraine standing for the sake of a Russia military defeat - that's the position of the US, the EU must not submit to its interest and strategy. The enhanced autonomy must not lead to the increased militarization of the EU member states. On the contrary, the EU should become a peaceful power that seeks balance in EU and pursues diplomacy.Global Times: What kind of security mechanism should EU pursue? China promotes a new security concept, what clues can this security concept offer to EU? Dagdelen: To save peace, security, and stability in EU, confrontation and bloc-based thinking need to be overcome. That's the first thing we have to do. The policy of détente implemented by the former federal chancellor Willy Brandt should serve as an example here. Peacefully balancing interests through diplomacy is the only way out of the spiral of escalation. Although this may seem utopian to many people in Germany today at this moment, our long-term goal has to be to dissolve NATO and replace it with a collective security system that has disarmament and cooperation as its overarching objective. There will be no peace in EU without or against Russia. This is what we have to learn from the current crisis. We have to have a security architecture, which is respecting each other's interests.Global Times: The EU deals with China simultaneously as a partner for cooperation and negotiation, an economic competitor and a systemic rival. Recently, some US and EU voices are hyping that ""China is losing EU."" What do you think of such voices? What are the incentives for future China-EU cooperation?Dagdelen: China-bashing has taken an increasingly aggressive form in the US and here in Germany and in EU. At the moment, the Germany government is planning to develop a new China strategy within the framework of the national security strategy. And this strategy will probably be as confrontational as NATO's new strategic concept.Germany and the EU should assume a role banking on balance and cooperation in the multipolar world of tomorrow. And this is widely important in order to preserve peace and solve global challenges, such as a pandemic and climate change, and also in the interest of the Germany population. Since Germany has close economic ties with China, the Germany government should take the path of cooperation instead of confrontation.I hope that the Germany government and the EU will look very seriously and very honest on the impacts of the economical war against Russia they started. They will see that the economy and trade in our world is so connected. If they start to decouple and wage an economical war against China as well, they are going to lose even more than regarding Russia now. I don't think that China is losing EU or EU is losing China. I think it's still a struggle because the US doesn't hide that it wants EU on its side against China. So, there is no hidden agenda; they are being very frank. This question has not been answered yet. And I hope reason prevails in the end.",OPINION,VIEWPOINT,Photo:VCG,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'Germany': ('LOC', 8), 'Ukraine': ('LOC', 10), 'West': ('LOC', 3), 'US': ('LOC', 1), 'UK': ('LOC', 1), 'Russia': ('LOC', 2), 'Istanbul': ('LOC', 1), 'Sevim Dagdelen': ('PER', 1), 'Wang Wenwen': ('PER', 1), 'Dagdel': ('PER', 1), 'Dagdelen': ('ORG', 1), 'Left Party': ('ORG', 1), 'Global Times': ('ORG', 3), 'EU': ('ORG', 2), 'Die Linke': ('ORG', 1), 'World War III': ('MISC', 2), 'China': ('MISC', 1)}"
189,West blamed for lack of communiqué at G20 meeting,Global Times,2022-07-17,"The G20 countries should promote the mechanism's role as a key platform for global economic cooperation and curb serious negative spillover effect of the policy adjustments by certain countries, China's Finance Minister Liu Kun said during a video speech at the third G20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors (FMCBG) Meeting over the weekend.The meeting, held in Indonesia's Bali resort island with finance leaders from the world's major economies seeking ways to tackle global economic threats, ended up without a joint statement despite finance chiefs' pledge to address global food insecurity and rising debt.China is committed to further global development partnerships; work on comprehensive poverty alleviation; safeguard global grain and energy security, and promote cooperation in public health, according to a statement posted on the MOF website on Saturday.To actively promote China-proposed Global Development Initiative (GDI), China plans to donate $50 million to the newly launched fund on Pandemic Prevention, Preparedness and Response at the World Bank, according to Liu.The G20 meeting was held at a critical time with many emerging market countries facing elevated debts and the world facing a grain and energy supply crisis in the wake of the Russia-Ukraine conflict.Issues highlighted for discussion at the meeting include global supply chain disruptions and rising commodity prices, revitalization of the global health architecture, debt management for poor countries, and financial policy normalization, among others. However, finance ministers and central bankers failed to issue a formal communiqué. Li Yong, deputy chairman of the Expert Committee of the China Association of International Trade, a think tank affiliated with China's Ministry of Commerce, told the Global Times on Sunday that failing to issue a formal communiqué showed that a number of West countries' attempt to impose their views about the Russia-Ukraine conflict on others at the G20 meeting has failed, due to the fact that many G20 countries have their independent position and opinion on the matter. ""The efforts by the West to hijack the important meeting with their political correctness in face of pressing global issues are in stark contrast with China's responsible move by offering donations to the World Bank fund,"" Li said.""China's actions beat the rhetoric of certain West countries,"" Li said.People's Bank of China Governor Yi Gang and Deputy Governor Chen Yulu also attended the meeting via video link.It is important to support the role of G20 as the premier forum for international economic cooperation by upholding multilateralism and strengthening policy coordination to preserve price stability and avoid negative spillovers of policy adjustments by some countries, and, collective efforts to deploy supportive policy measures are essential to address the global challenges, according to a PBC statement on Saturday.",SOURCE,ECONOMY,"A police officer walks past a G20 sign in Nusa Dua, Bali, Indonesia, Thursday, July 7, 2022.

190,Biden’s Middle East visit ‘empty- handed’ despite U-turn in stance,Zhao Yusha,2022-07-17," 

Palestinians protest against US President Joe Biden's visit, in Gaza City, on July 14, 2022. Thousands of Palestinians on Thursday staged demonstrations in the West Bank and Gaza Strip against US President Joe Biden's first visit to Israel and the Palestine territories, slamming his biased stance on the Israel-Palestine issue. Photo:XinhuaUS President Joe Biden concluded his four-day trip to the Middle East trying to give reassurances of US's influence in the region, which was riposted by China observers as this trip only showed that US influence in this region is declining, since Joe Biden returned home empty-handed after none of his major goals - pushing regional countries to contain Iran, and persuading them to increase oil supplies to slash Russia's oil income - were achieved. Moreover, the US President's repeated peddling of the so-called threat posed by China and Russia in the Middle East made the already conflict-laden region realize the increasing danger caused by the US. Experts said that making a U-turn to cozy up to Middle East countries when the US is in an oil crisis has further exposed the US' selfishness and hypocrisy to those regional countries, while choosing the wrong time for the visit which yielded few results meant that Joe Biden's first Middle East trip was yet another huge and awkward diplomatic blunder. In a speech during a summit with six Gulf states, Egypt, Jordan and Iraq in Jeddah, Joe Biden said that the US will remain an active, engaged partner in the Middle East, and US will not walk away and leave a vacuum to be filled by Russia, China or Iran, he said.""The US is invested in building a positive future for the region, in partnership with all of you — and the US is not going anywhere,"" he said, according to a transcript of his speech.Joe Biden made the remarks after concluding his four-day trip to the region, his first after more than a year and a half since taking office. Israel was the first leg of his four-day trip, followed by the West Bank and Saudi Arabia.But in the eyes of China experts, Joe Biden's Middle Eastern trip was both ""fruitless"" and ""embarrassing,"" as the two major goals of his administration are to coordinate regional countries to form an effective deterrence against Iran, and to push oil supply increases from Saudi Arabia in order to slash Russia's earnings from oil, a professor from the Institute of International Relations at the China Foreign Affairs University in Beijing, who requested anonymity, told the Global Times, noting that so far, none of those goals were achieved.   According to Reuters, the summit communiqué was vague, and Saudi Arabia, US's important Arab ally, poured cold water on US hopes that the summit could help lay the groundwork for a regional security alliance - including Israel - to combat Iran threats.Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman said on Saturday that there's also no guarantee the increase in oil production beyond current levels will happen, and that his country was nearly tapped out and could not produce more than 13 million more barrels per day, Politico reported.After Joe Biden repeatedly chided China and Russia before and during his trip, Saudi Minister of State for Foreign Affairs, Adel al-Jubeir, said in an interview with CNBC on Saturday that Riyadh will continue to bolster its partnerships with both US and Beijing. ""We build bridges with people; we don't see one as exclusive of the other,"" said the minister.Zhu Weilie, director of the Middle East Studies Institute at Shanghai International Studies University, pointed out that Joe Biden's Middle Eastern trip sends alarming signs to regional countries, as they see clearly that the US is not trying to solve problems, but seeking to lead the already conflict-stricken region to greater discord.The US will find it as hard to win over allies to contain China as it does in the Asia Pacific, said the Beijing-based expert, noting that China has no enemy country in the Middle East, only solid, mutual beneficial cooperation. ""Plus, China won't preach to Middle Eastern countries what to do and what values they should adopt, and won't slap sanctions on them,"" he said. In response to Joe Biden's remarks, a spokesperson from the China Embassy in Israel said on Saturday, ""The Middle East is a land of its people, not anyone's backyard. There is no so-called 'vacuum' there.""""The Middle East is not yet tranquil, with COVID-19 posing a protracted challenge to regional development and the spillover of the Ukraine crisis affecting regional security. The people in the Middle East want development and security more than anything else. The international community, and major countries in particular, should make it a priority and work constructively to help the countries and people in this region realize development and security, not otherwise,"" according to the spokesperson.As for Russia, Zhu said it is hard to edge Russia out of this region, not only because Russia has a strong presence there, but also because it shares strong energy ties with regional countries.Right after Joe Biden left, Russia President Vladimir Putin will travel to Tehran on July COVID-19 for a Syria summit with his Iran counterpart Ebrahim Raisi and Turkey's Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the Kremlin announced.Vladimir Putin's visit coming on the heels of Joe Biden's trip aims to show that Russia is still welcomed in Middle East, and is not a pariah, as US officials called it, said the anonymous expert, noting that Vladimir Putin's gesture also aims to show that it has maneuvered to compete with the US in this region. Moreover, as Joe Biden tries hard to win over Middle Eastern countries, they are edging closer to a truly multilateral framework that includes China and Russia. President of BRICS International Forum, Purnima Anand, said in an interview with the ""Izvestia"" newspaper that Turkey, Egypt and Saudi Arabia may join the BRICS International Forum ""very soon.""Embarrassing momentsBiden's administration has already been at odds with key Middle East allies such as Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Egypt over a range of issues, including human rights.Experts also pointed out that the US advocacy of human rights and its ideology are insurmountable obstacles that have caused deep-rooted suspicion and distrust between US and Middle Eastern countries, which are also growing more suspicious of US's ""self-interest first"" diplomacy. Joe Biden's photo with the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia also gained widespread international media attention, as he made a U-turn from calling the country a ""pariah"" over human rights issues to bumping fists and posing for pictures with him. ""This shows how hypocritical US diplomatic policy is. Once there are interests, they can immediately stamp on their so-called values right under their feet,"" said the Beijing-based expert. When bringing up the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi during his meeting with Prince Mohammed, the latter, apart from confirming that ""what happened is regrettable and we have taken all legal measures to prevent a recurrence,"" also hit back by saying that ""such an incident occurs anywhere in the world"", highlighting ""a number of mistakes"" made by US such as torturing detainees at Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq, Al-Arabiya reported. Zhu said that such a swift change of attitude also shows Joe Biden's anxiety in curbing rising US oil prices.

191,S.Korean FM kicks off 'ice-breaking' visit to Japan amid souring public sentiments,Xu Keyue,2022-07-17,"South Korea's foreign minister will make a three-day visit to Japan from Monday, the first in more than four years since bilateral ties sunk to their lowest level in decades due to historical issues. The visit caught public attention as it is expected to help restore the two countries' relations to a healthy state, especially amid current souring public sentiments.Park Jin will hold talks with Japan counterpart Yoshimasa Hayashi, as their countries seek to improve ties frayed by history-related disputes, Kyodo News reported on Friday.Park would be visiting Japan for the first time since he took up his post in May under the new administration of South Korea President Yoon Suk-yeol. During his trip, he plans to meet with Japan Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, Kyodo News citing sources as saying.Japan's Foreign Ministry said it hopes the South Korea foreign minister's visit would help restore the countries' relations to a ""healthy"" state.The sources told Kyodo News that Park is also expected to directly convey his condolences to Kishida and Hayashi over the death of former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.Relations between Tokyo and Seoul have slumped to the worst level in years following a South Korea top court decision in October 2018 ordering a Japan company to pay four men for forced labor during Japan's 1910-1945 period of brutal colonial rule on the Korean Peninsula. But the Japan firms have not complied with the ruling.China observers said the wartime labor row between the two countries is expected to be one of the focuses during Park's visit.South Korea courts have ordered Japan companies to pay compensation to South Korea plaintiffs who say they or their relatives were forced into laboring for firms during World War II, while the country's netizens have been urging Japan to reflect on itself and apologize for historical issues. Meanwhile, anti-South Korea sentiment has also intensified among the Japan public as Abe's assassination was linked to a religious group founded in South Korea.After the shooter was arrested, he claimed that the assassination was because of Abe's connection to the Family Federation for World Peace and Unification, known as the Unification Church, a religious group founded in South Korea, which had been identified as a cult in China. China observers believe that Park's visit could bring signs of hopes for solving the historical issue as the two governments are likely to make concessions. For example, Japan may agree to make some compensation to the South Korea plaintiffs.However, the South Korea public appears to have low expectations over Japan's reaction to the historical issues, as many believe Japan would not truly recognize the damage its historical crimes inflicted on South Koreans, so they will not compromise easily, Lü Chao, an expert on the Korean Peninsula at the Liaoning Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times on Sunday.Also the Korean Peninsula issue, so-called threats from China, the Russia-Ukraine conflict and other geopolitical issues in Northeast Asia are likely to be covered during Park's visit, observers predicted.The meeting between the two foreign ministers could pave the way for a potential meeting between the two leaders as the possibility that Yoon will visit Japan when Abe's national funeral will be hold in the fall could not be ruled out, Da Zhigang, director of the Institute of Northeast Asia Studies at Heilongjiang Provincial Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times on Sunday.Japan and South Korea may talk about improving military intelligence sharing led by the US, Da said, warning that it would cause intensified confrontations in Northeast Asia, harm multilateral cooperation, increase the uncertainty of geopolitics and hinder economic recovery in the region.Tokyo, following US, is likely to actively force Seoul to take sides amid the China-US competition, Lü said. US and Tokyo are trying to pressure Seoul to lean on them more to drive a wedge between Seoul and Beijing, the observer noted.However, considering China is the most important economic partner and the significance of ties with China, South Korea is unlikely to give in to the pressure from the US and Japan easily, the observer said.Under mediation and pressure from the US, a signal of easing tensions between Japan and South Korea emerged after Yoon took office, who has vowed to take a ""future-oriented"" approach to the bilateral relationship. Last month, Kishida and Yoon spoke briefly in Madrid during the NATO Summit in their first face-to-face encounter amid chilly ties over wartime issues, the Japan Times reported.But so far, there is no sign that bilateral ties will see much improvement because of the profound historical contradictions, Lü said.",CHINA,DIPLOMACY,"South Korean President Yoon Suk-yeol (left), US President Joe Biden (center) and Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida attend a trilateral summit at the IFEMA Convention Center in Madrid on June 29, 2022.

192,Sufficient reasons to remain confident in Chinese economy: Global Times editorial,Global Times,2022-07-15,"According to data released by the National Bureau of Statistics on Friday, China's gross domestic product (GDP) increased by 2.5 percent year-on-year in the first half of this year, while GDP in the second quarter increased by 0.4 percent year-on-year. Under the impact of unexpected factors such as the Russia-Ukraine conflict and new waves of COVID-19 outbreaks, we have withstood the test, achieved positive growth, and stabilized the economy. This has not been easy, and the China economy has once again shown great resilience.Judging from the overall trend of the first half of the year, it is not difficult to see that the economy performed fairly well in January and February. In March and April, it was severely affected, and in May and June, it showed a trend of gradual stabilization and recovery. The overall economic trend showed a V-shaped rebound. Foreign trade, manufacturing and other fields have achieved higher-than-expected growth, especially high-tech manufacturing, and the output of new energy vehicles and solar batteries has also increased significantly. At the same time, summer grain production has seen a bumper harvest, which will help ensure the country's food security and avoid risks at a time when the shadow of a food crisis looms over the world. These all indicate that the difficulties are temporary, and the strong endogenous momentum of the China economy will continue to play a role.In addition to the inherent resilience of the China economy, the fact that it was able to make a turn for the better under extremely difficult conditions can also be attributed to the obvious results of a series of policies that aim to stabilize the economy pushed forward by the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee and the State Council in a timely manner. In other words, this is a manifestation and proof of China's economic governance capabilities. ""Intrinsic resilience"" and ""governance capability"" are the two most critical factors for US to assess and judge the current situation and prospects of China's economy, and they are a strong foundation for our continued confidence and optimism. Optimism is by no means the same thing as avoiding problems, and blind optimism can never overcome obstacles. The road ahead for China will not be smooth: global economic recovery is still fragile and weak, the risk of widespread stagflation is rising, domestic epidemics are still sporadic, sluggish domestic demand and supply shocks have become intertwined, structural contradictions and cyclical problems are superimposed, and market entities are still facing difficulties. The foundation for sustained economic recovery is not stable. All of these pose challenges to China's future development. Injecting confidence and impetus into the overall recovery of the economy, especially in stabilizing employment, stabilizing prices, and activating the vitality of market players, still faces severe tests. In this regard, the Party and the government have a clear, profound and truth-seeking understanding, and have active and prudent countermeasures in place.It is worth mentioning that in recent years, China has insisted on implementing a steady monetary policy, leaving sufficient policy space and tools in reserve to cope with new challenges and unexpected changes. According to data released on Friday, the added value of high-tech manufacturing increased by 9.6 percent year-on-year, 6.2 percentage points faster than all industries above designated size. Further adjustment and optimization of the economic structure will certainly enhance the resilience and vitality of the China economy.The recent incidents involving some rural banks in Central China's Henan Province and some unfinished residential projects that have ignited public opinions have attracted the attention of the relevant authorities, and it is believed that their risks will be effectively controlled. They are long-term problems accumulated during economic development, but have recently emerged in a concentrated manner, indicating that short-term difficulties have been superimposed on the economic transformation period, and it is easy to expose these accumulated problems. Various recent situations have further demonstrated that epidemic prevention, economic stabilization, and the safety of development are all essential.The basic characteristics of China's economy such as sufficient potential, great resilience, and strong vitality have not changed. Compared with other major economies in the world, China's ""troubles"" are more short-term and temporary. At the same time, China's status as a major manufacturing country is more stable, which enhances our ability to resist risks.Most importantly, under the strong leadership of the CPC Central Committee, concentrating on big tasks has always been China's prominent advantage. Now that we have identified the problem and have a strong determination and a clear path, we will be able to resolve the difficulties. There will be ups and downs in the future, but as long as the whole of society works together, there will be no hills that cannot be climbed or hurdles that cannot be overcome.",OPINION,EDITORIAL,GDP Photo:VCG,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'National Bureau of Statistics': ('ORG', 1), 'Communist Party of China': ('ORG', 1), 'CPC': ('ORG', 1), 'Central Committee': ('ORG', 1), 'State Council': ('ORG', 1), 'China': ('LOC', 7), 'Russia': ('LOC', 1), 'Ukraine': ('LOC', 1), 'US': ('LOC', 1), 'COVID - 19': ('MISC', 1)}"
193,US criticized for using intl platform for cooperation to exert pressure on other countries,GT staff reporters,2022-07-16,"As the US lashed out at Russia at the Group of 20 (G20) summit and tried to talk other economies into intensifying pressure on Moscow, experts said such a move was expected, and criticized the US for again using what should be a platform for cooperation to exert pressure on other countries.This is also a shirking of responsibility, as the US tried to pile all the blame for surging domestic inflation on the Russia-Ukraine conflict, they said, responding to remarks by US government officials ahead of and during G20 calling for pressure to be put on Russia over some international issues such as the food crisis, which were in fact the result of multiple factors, including the US' sanctions on Russia.US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, speaking at a meeting of G20 finance officials in Indonesia, on Friday urged major G20 economies to take urgent action to address a short-term food security crisis, and avoid market-distorting export restrictions and stockpiling, according to Reuters on Friday. Russia President Vladimir Putin was ""using food as a weapon of war,"" she claimed, citing ""the destruction of agricultural facilities, theft of grain and farm equipment, and the effec-tive blockade of Black Sea ports.""One day earlier, Yellen said she will continue to press G20 allies at the meeting for a price cap on Russia oil and pressure Moscow to end war while bringing down energy costs, according to Agence France-Presse.The US using G20 to criticize Russia is expected, and it is in line with its consistent position, judging from the behavior of the US, Song Guoyou, deputy director of the Center for US Studies, Fudan University, told the Global Times on Friday.Currently, the US' diplomatic focus is dealing with the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, so they will spare no effort in condemning Russia, which shows that the US is taking advantage of international mechanisms for its own interests, and ""this is long-term behavior,"" Song added. Sanctions against Russia are only carried out by the US and some West countries, and are not applicable to the G20 platform, which is more of a global organization, He Weiwen, an executive council member of the China Society for World Trade Organization Studies, told the Global Times on Friday.China experts said G20 is a platform for cooperation, not a platform for one country to put pressure on another, which is a manifestation of confrontation not cooperation.Urging some countries to put pressure on Russia is also not in line with the purpose and original intention of G20, Bai Ming, deputy director of the international market research institute at the China Academy of International Trade and Economic Cooperation, told the Global Times on Friday.""It can be seen that the US does not put the food problem first, but is using it as a pretext to suppress Russia,"" Bai said, noting that the Russia-Ukraine conflict was ignited by the long-term hostility of the US-led NATO to Russia.Apart from Russia, China is also becoming a target of the US. China is a ""very important"" creditor of Sri Lanka and it would likely be in the interests of both countries if China participated in restructuring Sri Lanka's debt, Yellen said on Thursday.Yellen said she would urge other members of the G20 major economies to put pressure on China to be more cooperative in long-stalled efforts to restructure the debts of countries in debt distress, including Sri Lanka.Observers are calling for global efforts for an immediate debt restructuring plan to help the country get through its difficulties.""For the difficulties faced by Sri Lanka, China will continue to provide assistance to the best of its ability and support Sri Lanka's early economic recovery and improvement of people's livelihoods,"" Shu Jueting, a spokesperson of the MOFCOM, told a regular press conference on Thursday.China is willing to work with the relevant countries and international financial institutions to continue playing an active role in addressing the current difficulties, easing the debt burden and achieving sustainable development for Sri Lanka, China Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said on Friday.The financial leaders of the world's leading economies met on the Indonesian island of Bali on Friday, looking for ways to counter economic fallout, inflation and other global crises that are hitting economies across the world.China experts said all countries would agree with the need to alleviate the world's food crisis and demand the opening of food transportation channels, including Russia, which has never said that it hinders food transportation, ""so the G20 countries should be consistent in this regard.""",SOURCE,ECONOMY,"US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen addresses an Atlantic Council Front Page event on April 13, 2022 in Washington, DC.

194,"Xinjiang no longer a remote corner, but a core area, hub in BRI: Xi",GT staff reporters,2022-07-16,"Eight years after his visit to China's Xinjiang region in 2014, China President Xi Jinping made a second trip to the northwest region and stressed efforts to fully and faithfully implement the policies of the Communist Party of China (CPC) for the governance of Xinjiang in the new era, highlighting social stability and lasting security as the overarching goal and the region's significant role in building the Belt and Road Initiative.Analysts said Xi Jinping's visit to Xinjiang signals that after achieving fundamental changes from disturbance to stability, the Xinjiang region is entering a new phase of being built into the bridgehead of China's westward opening-up, despite  the US' economic suffocation of the region.  While staying in the Xinjiang region from Tuesday to Friday, President Xi Jinping visited many places in Urumqi, including Xinjiang University, the Urumqi International Land Port Area, the Guyuanxiang community in Tianshan District and the Museum of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region. He also went to Shihezi and Turpan and inspected villages and the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps (XPCC) and had communications with local residents.On Friday afternoon, residents of all ethnic groups saw off Xi Jinping with prolonged applause before him returning to Beijing. During the visit, President Xi Jinping also called for developing Xinjiang into a region that is united, harmonious, prosperous, and culturally advanced, with healthy ecosystems and people living and working in contentment.


China President Xi Jinping, also general secretary of the CPC Central Committee and chairman of the Central Military Commission, waves to people of various ethnic groups while visiting the community of Guyuanxiang in the Tianshan District in the city of Urumqi, capital of China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, July 13, 2022. Photo:XinhuaXi's visit to the Xinjiang region is a strong and significant indication that while maintaining prolonged stability and achieving economic development, Xinjiang region is stepping into a new phase of economic development and has been built as a core hub for the building of China's Belt and Road Initiative and the bridgehead for westward opening-up, Wang Yuting, associate professor of the Institute of China Borderland Studies at the China Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times. Soon after Xi Jinping's visit to Xinjiang in 2014, the second symposium on the region's work was held in May in Beijing and stressed long-term stability as the main goal for the region. Under this guidance, over the past eight years, the region has experienced fundamental changes, going from disturbance to social stability.After getting rid of the influence of terrorist attacks, Xinjiang and the whole West region of China have realized stability, laying the foundation for China to further boost its West region and deepen cooperation with Central and West Asia countries, said Wang Yuting, noting that Xinjiang's role as a core hub of the Silk Road Economic Belt has significant strategic value and meaning, especially amid the global changes brought by the Ukraine crisis.While Xinjiang has achieved social stability, safeguarding this hard-won situation is not easy, especially with the US and some West countries smearing China on human rights, Wang Jiang, an expert at the Institute of China's Borderland Studies at Zhejiang Normal University, told the Global Times.Achieving long-term stability requires long-term prosperity, and to achieve long prosperity, the region should be integrated into the nation's development. Building it as a hub for westward opening-up aims to help it find new places in global trade and to break the US economic blockade on the region, Wang Jiang said.In addition to economic development, ethnic unity and cultural heritage were also key words for President Xi Jinping's visits in Xinjiang. While staying in Urumqi, President Xi Jinping visited the Guyuanxiang community in Tianshan district. Xi Jinping said he pays great attention to community work and is very glad to see local communities thriving. Xi Jinping also watched a Manas performance and said that China civilization is extensive and profound, and has a long history stretching back to antiquity. Wang Yuting also pointed out that President Xi Jinping's visit in Xinjiang also showcased China's enriched policy for the governance of Xinjiang in the new era, including maintaining stability in the region through ethnic unity, nurturing the cultures of Xinjiang, promoting prosperity among the local residents, and developing Xinjiang from a long-term perspective.Cultures of ethnic groups in Xinjiang are also important parts of China culture and this is why President Xi Jinping went to the museums and stressed heritage protection, the expert noted.

Photo:XinhuaEurasia hub The Xinjiang region, once an important passage of the ancient Silk Road, has become a key gateway of China's westward opening up and the core area of the Silk Road Economic Belt, analysts said, hailing the region's prominent advantages in deepening foreign exchange and cooperation, including its unparalleled geographic location, abundant natural resources, profound cultural heritage and preferential policies. On Tuesday, Xi Jinping visited the Urumqi International Land Port (UILP) and observed the operation of various functional areas of the China-EU Freight Train (Urumqi) assembly center and the Alashankou and Khorgos ports on real-time video.""The Belt and Road Initiative has yielded fruitful results since it was initiated. As the joint building of BRI continues to advance, Xinjiang is no longer a remote corner but a core area and a hub. What you have done is of historic significance,"" Xi Jinping said.President Xi Jinping's inspection of the UILP shows that China's attitude and determination to open up to Central Asia and boost the development and opening of West China have not changed, Liu Zongyi, secretary-general of the Research Center for China-South Asia Cooperation at the Shanghai Institutes for International Studies, told the Global Times on Friday. Liu noted that in the past, China opened up to the sea and now we are also paying attention to opening up on the land, in other words, China's opening-up not only engages with developed countries but also developing countries. During his visit in April 2014, President Xi Jinping pointed out that the Xinjiang region has an irreplaceable position and role in building the Silk Road Economic Belt. One month later, the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee proposed making efforts to build Xinjiang into a ""core area"" of the Silk Road Economic Belt. UILP, which was launched at the end of 2015, is a landmark project in carrying out the construction of the core area of the Silk Road Economic Belt and is committed to developing itself into an international land logistics hub that connects Eurasia, an international supply chain organization center, a highland for attracting modern industries and an important functional area of China's free trade pilot zone, Zhong Hehua, deputy director of Development Service Center of the UILP, told a press conference on Tuesday. UILP is also an important hub for China-EU freight trains. Previously, these freight trains were scattered across China, resulting in low efficiency and small volumes of freight traffic in each city. The UILP has effectively adjusted and integrated freights and reduced transportation times, Zhao Juan, a research fellow with the China Railway Economic and Planning Research Institute, told the Global Times on Friday.President Xi Jinping's visit to UILP sent an important signal on the trend of integrated China-EU freight trains and also highlighted their important role in promoting logistics along the Belt and Road route, Zhao said, pointing out that China-EU freight train trips have increased since the pandemic and have been responsible for the majority of freight transport in the post-pandemic era. According to data from the Xinjiang regional government, to date, Xinjiang has run more than 5,900 China-EU freight trains, and UILP has run a total of 609 China-EU trains from January to June 2022, a year-on-year increase of 36 percent.China's products can be exported to the US and the West from coastal areas and also to other regions via the land hub of Xinjiang, which can not only meet the increasingly strong demand from neighboring countries but also help speed up the region's opening-up to find new ways out amid the US economic suffocation, Wang Tingyu said.In recent years, the US and some West countries, together with anti-China forces, have smeared China's policies in Xinjiang and made groundless accusations of ""genocide"" or ""forced labor."" On June 21, the US' so-called Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act (UFLPA) took effect and bans products made in China's Xinjiang, smearing the China government over ""oppression"" of the Uygurs and other minority populations in its Xinjiang region.Analysts criticized the US law as an escalation to contain China by using human rights topics in the Xinjiang region as excuses, and pointed out that such malicious acts severely violate international trade rules and affect the stability of the global supply chain. However, in facing with the US economic blockade, the total volume of foreign trade in the Xinjiang region has increased with wider cooperation with more countries. According to data from the Xinjiang regional government, from 2016 to 2021, the total volume of foreign trade in Xinjiang increased from 139.8 billion yuan to 156.9 billion yuan. Xinjiang gained an increasing number of trading partners in more than 170 countries and regions. Wang Jiang noted that despite the West's and US' smear campaign against the Xinjiang region, its development and stability have been witnessed by more people who have visited the region. ""China has always been open and invited others to visit the region, including the UN human rights chief. While debunking the lies created by some anti-China forces, we also focus on the region's development to benefit the residents of ethnic groups,"" Wang Jiang said.",CHINA,SOCIETY,"Chinese President Xi Jinping talks with residents in the Guyuanxiang community in Tianshan district, Urumqi, during his visit to Northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region from July 12 to 15.

196,More countries knocking on BRICS’ door a sign the world needs fairer governance than West-dominated one,Global Times,2022-07-16,"BRICS, a grouping of major emerging economies - Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa - has become one of the trending buzzwords in global public opinion lately. After Iran and Argentina applied to join the BRICS mechanism, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and Egypt also plan to knock on the door of the BRICS for official membership, Sputnik quoted BRICS International Forum President Purnima Anand as saying.If the trend tells anything, it is the growing charm of BRICS' strength and values, as well as the loss of attraction in the current West-dominated global governance. Crises have been surfacing on a global level since the outbreak of the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Quite a few countries, especially those in the West, are being confronted with crippling inflation, untenable energy costs, looming recessions and food shortage. Yet BRICS countries have shown much less sensitivity and vulnerability than the US and EU countries amid these challenges.The reason stems from BRICS members' own strength and enhanced cooperation within the group. According to the World Bank, Russia holds the world's largest natural gas reserves, the second largest coal reserves, and the eighth largest oil reserves. Brazil has diverse agricultural products and vast mineral wealth. Their different advantages plus the promotion of BRICS' cooperation on food supply and the exchanges of national currencies have made the group less impacted by the global crises.More importantly, BRICS countries have the will, and, in different degrees, capability, to fix the deficit in global governance. In this regard, BRICS has already launched a series of innovations. Take the BRICS-led New Development Bank (NDB). The initial subscribed capital is equally distributed among the founding members - the five BRCIS countries. The voting power of each member is also equal based on their shares in the capital stock of the bank. This example, just a tiny part of the BRICS cooperation though, shows that BRICS is a group where the five countries are on a completely equal footing, with equal rights to speak, vote, and make decisions. This is nothing like any West alliance, where there is always a dominant role who has the biggest say in the bloc, and with crystal clear agenda - bloc confrontation. When facing possible BRICS enlargement, the West can hardly hide their Cold War mentality. Since the BRICS summit was held in June, West media outlets have been hyping the topic under the theme of East-West confrontation. Earlier this month, US magazine Newsweek said that when NATO's ""largest expansion in decades"" took place, ""Beijing and Moscow are looking to take on new members of their own"" blocs, and BRICS was named particularly in the article. By the end of June, the Hill published a headline, ""An out-of-touch G7 could lose global leadership to BRICS.""On Twitter, some West netizens also describe BRICS as a rival of G7 and NATO. It cannot be more narrow-minded to view BRICS in this way. As if for some Westerners, when some countries get together, they are bonding to have a target to oppose, just like what the West has always done. Cooperation has been one of the natural needs across the globe, as well as a normal state in international relations for a long time. Why deliberately twist a specific cooperation into a bloc confrontation? BRICS has simply no interest in becoming another G7 or NATO.Instead, as stipulated in the organization's spirit, namely ""openness, inclusiveness and win-win cooperation,"" BRICS calls for global security and economic governance, while emphasizing not only South-South cooperation, but also dialogues between South and North.What BRICS is against are power politics, hegemony, the law of the jungle, all of which basically determine that in international politics, only major powers have a say, and small countries must be obedient, or even be exploited. Against this backdrop, BRICS calls for fairness and justice, a global governance in which developing countries have their due status and their voices can be heard. The BRICS just want to bring a balance in the current global order. When the West compares BRICS with G7 and NATO, it has turned a blind eye to the fact that G7 has long become a rich countries' club, and NATO's mentality is still trapped in the Cold War. Whenever G7 attempts to put up a show to discuss various global issues nowadays, all it really cares about is containment of China and Russia. But BRICS advocates win-win for the entire world, that is, a win-win not just for the developing countries, but also for the developed powers. This is the biggest difference between BRICS and West blocs. In the past, developing countries had not enough strength to reach the goal. Now the timing has come.Regulations or legal procedures for BRICS enlargement are under discussion. It is thus unlikely that BRICS will absorb new members any time soon before relevant principles and rules are carried out. But when Turkey, a NATO ally, applies for BRICS membership, it mirrors BRICS, be it its capacity or ideas, represents something much cooler than US-dominated rules and orders. At least it signals that the world needs a reformed governance where West voices are not the only sound. The article is compiled by Global Times reporter based on an interview with Zhu Tianxiang, director at the Center for BRICS Political and Security Studies, Institute of BRICS Studies of Sichuan International Studies University.  opinion@globaltimes.com.cn",OPINION,VIEWPOINT,BRICS Photo: VCG,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'Sputnik': ('ORG', 1), 'BRICS International Forum': ('ORG', 15), 'EU': ('ORG', 1), 'World Bank': ('ORG', 1), 'New Development Bank': ('ORG', 1), 'NDB': ('ORG', 1), 'BRCIS': ('ORG', 1), 'Cold': ('ORG', 1), 'Brazil': ('LOC', 2), 'Russia': ('LOC', 3), 'India': ('LOC', 1), 'China': ('LOC', 1), 'South Africa': ('LOC', 1), 'Iran': ('LOC', 1), 'Argentina': ('LOC', 1), 'Saudi Arabia': ('LOC', 1), 'Turkey': ('LOC', 1), 'Egypt': ('LOC', 1), 'Ukraine': ('LOC', 1), 'US': ('LOC', 1), 'Purnima Anand': ('PER', 1), 'West': ('MISC', 5)}"
197,"Chinese yuan resilient due to solid fundamentals, as major currencies plunge against US dollar",GT staff reporters,2022-07-14,"As global major currencies, notably the euro, have weakened sharply against the US dollar amid worsening global financial turbulence, the China yuan has remained remarkably stable and China assets have become increasingly attractive to global investors, underscoring China's solid economic fundamentals, economists said on Thursday.The central parity rate of the China yuan strengthened 17 basis points to 6.7265 against the US dollar on Thursday, with its fluctuation range further narrowing since mid-May, according to data from the China Foreign Exchange Trade System.The yuan's stabilizing trend comes as the US Dollar Index (DXY) keeps hitting nearly two-decade highs. As of press time on Thursday, the reading peaked at 109.29 in intraday trading, surging over 13 percent year-to-date.Corresponding to the sharp appreciation of the US dollar this year, major currencies, including the euro, the UK pound and the Japan yen, have seen their values slump by 11-16 percent. The euro even plunged below parity against the dollar on Wednesday, the first time in 20 years, according to media reports.By comparison, the yuan has shown strong resilience amid the turbulent forex market, depreciating only about 5.4 percent against the dollar year-to-date. Starting from mid-April, the yuan's rate against the dollar weakened sharply from 6.3896 to 6.7871 on May 16. Since then, the reading has been generally fluctuating around 6.7, with a narrowing range.The pressure on the yuan has effectively been relieved after a round of depreciation, Guan Tao, BOC International's global chief economist and a former official at the State Administration of Foreign Exchange, told the Global Times on Thursday.With the Omicron flare-ups in China being generally put under control since May, government policies to stabilize growth have been rolled out and started to take effect, Guan said, noting that both economic and financial indicators have improved.""In particular, the rapid recovery of the country's exports in May and June, with an expanding trade surplus, has formed fundamental support for the stabilization of the yuan,"" Guan said.The yuan's exchange rate mechanism, which anchors it to a basket of currencies, helps to keep it fluctuating in a relatively stable range, Zhou Yu, a research fellow at the Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times.Amid skyrocketing inflation in the US, market observers believe that the dollar will remain strong for the rest of the year and keep piling pressure on other currencies. The US CPI surged to a 41-year high at 9.1 percent in June, latest official data showed on Wednesday.Though the US is mired in economic woes, EU has even worse economic fundamentals, with surging stagflation risks, analysts said, noting that the Ukraine crisis stoked by the US-led NATO has brought about a serious energy shortage for many EU countries and badly dampened their economic prospects.The eurozone's main economies, including Germany and France, have seen deteriorating developments. Germany posted a trade deficit in May, the first time in more than 30 years.While other major economies struggle with soaring inflation, which has led to tightening monetary policies and recession risks, China's inflation has remained at a mild level, and its fiscal and monetary policies are in normal conditions, Guan said, noting that it has left China ample space to cope with risks from both home and overseas. ""That is the reason why investors have confidence in yuan-denominated assets,"" Guan said. Stocks in the China mainland have outperformed many major overseas markets recently. Foreign capital flowing into mainland markets through Hong Kong, otherwise known as ""northbound capital,"" totaled 73 billion yuan ($10.8 billion) in June, according to statistics from Founder Securities.Some countries have started to raise the share of the yuan in their foreign currency reserves as well. Belarus was the latest, announcing a plan to include the yuan in its reserves on Wednesday.Zhou noted that besides the yuan's value, US's constantly using the dollar as a weapon to sanction others is another factor driving countries to consider diversifying their reserves.""Essentially, it is China's strong fundamentals that support investors' faith in the yuan,"" Guan concluded.",SOURCE,ECONOMY,Renminbi Photo: VCG,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'US': ('LOC', 3), 'China': ('LOC', 6), 'UK': ('LOC', 1), 'Japan': ('LOC', 1), 'Foreign Exchange Trade': ('ORG', 1), 'BOC International': ('ORG', 1), 'State Administration of Foreign Exchange': ('ORG', 1), 'Global': ('ORG', 1), 'System': ('MISC', 1), 'US Dollar Index': ('MISC', 1), 'DX': ('MISC', 1), 'G': ('MISC', 2), 'Guan Tao': ('PER', 1)}"
198,G20 coordination is the key to tackle looming global debt crisis,Wang Yi,2022-07-15,"A police officer walks past a G20 sign in Nusa Dua, Bali, Indonesia, Thursday, July 7, 2022. Foreign ministers from the Group of 20 leading rich and developing nations are gathering in Indonesia's resort island of Bali for talks. Photo: VCG?For the first time in two decades, the US dollar is equal to the euro in value, The US Post reported on Wednesday. As EU grapples with growing recession fears and the fallout from the Russia-Ukraine conflict, analysts warned the euro's tumble to parity against the dollar could have major impacts on the EU and global economies. The US dollar's recent rally on steep Fed rate hike bets is putting pressure on central banks and currencies of a majority of economies. Besides the euro, which is closely affected by the Russia-Ukraine conflict and the US-led sanctions against Russia, the Japan yen and UK pound are also losing terrain against the US dollar.The strong dollar will undoubtedly bring severe impacts to the economy of EU region and other developed countries, but the bigger problem with the strengthening of the dollar now is that it may lead to a cascading debt crisis in emerging economies. The managing director of the International Monetary Fund warned on Tuesday that ""there is a growing risk of a debt crisis"" amid COVID-19 pandemic, tightening monetary policy and the rising cost of servicing debt in US dollars, according to media reports. Some 30 percent of developing and emerging markets, and 60 percent of low-income countries, are at or near debt distress, the IMF chief added. As early as January this year, the IMF warned that global debt reached a record $226 trillion, with the highest annual increase since World War II in 2020. A global debt storm may be imminent. In addition to Sri Lanka, which is deeply in debt crisis, according to media reports, since April, Peru, Egypt and Tunisia have all experienced domestic turmoil caused by soaring food and energy prices. Given the dominance of the dollar in the global financial system, its rally will make it more difficult for businesses and households in many economies outside the US to obtain financing. Global financial conditions tighten further as the dollar goes up, putting pressure on a wide range of emerging markets, especially those that are weaker.When it comes to the debt issue, the first thing the international community discusses is to have an aid mechanism, which is of course necessary. But what is more critical is to find out where this debt crisis comes from. This wave of global debt is certainly partly caused by COVID-19 pandemic, but more importantly, the root cause is the US-led sanctions against Russia, which caused hikes in food and energy prices fanning inflation in many economies.Therefore, the reason why the current global debt crisis continues to deteriorate is that the US and its allies are taking the escalation of sanctions against Russia as their top priority. Unless this approach is changed, the global debt crisis is not expected to be resolved soon.For EU, its current predicament lies in multiple factors. Many observers believe that the US-led NATO's adherence to cold war thinking and its continued eastward expansion are some of the reasons for the intensification of the Russia-Ukraine conflict. EU is actually paying for the US' strategy. The US should not let EU countries, let alone the vast number of developing countries, bear the consequences of this looming crisis.In order to prevent the global economy be dragged into a disaster, major economies should conduct policy communication and coordination in the spirit of mutual respect and benefit. The G7 mechanism has been proven to be unable to reflect the spirit of the times and incapable of gathering global efforts to deal with crises. The G20 mechanism should play key role to coordinate efforts to turn the current situation around.The author is an editor with the Global Times. bizopinion@globaltimes.com.cn",OPINION,VIEWPOINT,Picture description not found,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'G20': ('MISC', 1), 'COVID': ('MISC', 1), '19': ('MISC', 1), 'World War II': ('MISC', 1), 'Nusa Dua': ('LOC', 1), 'Bali': ('LOC', 2), 'Indonesia': ('LOC', 2), 'US': ('LOC', 6), 'Russia': ('LOC', 3), 'Ukraine': ('LOC', 2), 'Japan': ('LOC', 1), 'UK': ('LOC', 1), 'Sri Lanka': ('LOC', 1), 'Peru': ('LOC', 1), 'Egypt': ('LOC', 1), 'Tunisia': ('LOC', 1), 'Group of 20': ('ORG', 1), 'VC': ('ORG', 1), 'The US Post': ('ORG', 1), 'EU': ('ORG', 3), 'Fed': ('ORG', 1), 'International Monetary Fund': ('ORG', 1), 'IMF': ('ORG', 2)}"
199,China’s H1 GDP expands 2.5% as economy braves mounting challenges,GT Staff reporters,2022-07-15,"China's economy has braved a series of challenges posed by domestic COVID-19 outbreaks and a worsening global environment, posting 2.5 percent year-on-year growth in the first half of 2022, official data showed on Friday.   The expansion of the world's second-largest economy is fueled by a quick recovery in economic activities after outbreaks in major cities were effectively reined in under the country's dynamic zero-COVID-19 strategy and the efficient execution of a slew of pro-growth measures, analysts pointed out. China's GDP growth, though slowing down from the first quarter largely because of the impact of COVID-19, was mostly in line with market expectations and offers a bright light for the global economy that is mired in a series of troubles, ranging from the pandemic to the Russia-Ukraine conflict to looming economic crises in many countries around the world, including the US, experts said.In the first half of the year, China’s GDP grew 2.5 percent year-on-year to 56.3 trillion yuan ($8.3 trillion), the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) said on Friday. In the second quarter of 2022, when the country faced severe COVID-19 outbreaks, GDP grew 0.4 percent year-on-year, the slowest pace since the outbreak in 2020, as compared with a 4.8 percent in the first quarter of the year.Fu Linghui, a spokesperson for the NBS, said on Friday that the effects of a series of economic stabilization policies are clear, while China's economy has overcome the negative impact of unexpected factors to show a stabilizing and improving trend. In particular, China has achieved positive economic growth in the second quarter and stabilized the economic situation. This is not an easy milestone to have achieved.The downward pressure on China's economy increased significantly in the second quarter due to a surge of COVID-19 in major China cities, especially its economic hub Shanghai, Cong Yi, professor at the Tianjin University of Finance and Economics, told the Global Times on Friday.""However, the positive growth in Q2 as a result of a strong rebound in June has indicated the resilience of the China economy to quickly recover from the epidemic shock,"" Cong said. Major June macroeconomic data also pointed to a strong rebound of the economy after China emerged from the worst outbreak of the virus since early 2020, with an accelerated recovery in industrial production and improved consumer confidence.The value-added industrial output of major industrial enterprises rose 3.4 percent year-on-year in the first half of the year. It grew 0.7 percent year-on-year in the second quarter, on par with the growth in May. The growth quickened in June to 3.4 percent, 3.2 percentage points faster than in May.""The rebound in June was largely due to the fundamentals of China's economy and the stability of China's production system. Once we can get production back in order an economic rebound will follow,"" Cong said.Retail sales, a main gauge of consumption, dropped by 4.6 percent in Q2, narrowing the gap from a slide of 6.7 percent in May, according to data from the NBS. It grew 3.1 percent year-on-year in June. The rebound of consumption comes after both central and local governments introduced measures to boost consumption, especially the stimulus on the automobile sector, Cong said.China produced 2.499 million cars and sold 2.502 million units in June, up 28.2 percent and 23.8 percent year-on-year respectively, according to data released by the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers on Monday.Fixed-asset investment, an important pillar for economic growth, also grew 6.1 percent in the first half of the year. It quickened its growth in May and June, posting 4.6 percent and 5.6 percent growth, compared with 1.8 percent growth in April. Fixed-assets investment gained pace as a result of the accelerated allocation of special-purpose bonds to drive up investment, experts said. According to the Ministry of Finance, the annual quota of local special bonds should be issued by June. A total of 1.93 trillion yuan ($ 285.3 billion) of local government bonds were issued in June, up 143.27 percent year-on-year and 60.11 percent from May.In addition, a decision was made at a State Council executive meeting on June 29 to use policy and development financial instruments to raise 300 billion yuan ($ 44.4 billion) through the issuance of financial bonds, which will be used to supplement capital of major projects.The trade sector also presented a brighter-than-expected growing trend as well. China's foreign trade posted a resilient growth of 9.4 percent in the first half of the year driven by a rebound in imports and exports in the Yangtze River Delta region, which expanded by 9.3 percent in H1 as the economy bounces back from the Omicron shock, according to data released by the General Administration of Customs of China on Wednesday.Observers said the slew of favorable figures signals that China economy has bottomed out in the second quarter and expects a strong rebound for the second half of the year, also paving the way for China to moving closer toward its annual growth target of 5.5 percent.Production and recovery in the manufacturing sector and exports growth are expected to continue into H2 as there is a solid confidence on China's economic growth, Cong said.According to him, in order to achieve the 5.5 percent growth goal, the government needs to step up policy efforts, especially to stimulate consumption and accelerate investment in infrastructure in the second half of the year.Wei Jianguo, Vice Chairman of the China Center for International Economic Exchange (CCIEE) and former vice minister of commerce, told the Global Times on Thursday that China's economy will have the chance to leap to the stated target of around 5.5.""Foreign trade in the second half of the year will likely continue the momentum in the first half with double-digit growth expected. Meanwhile, with the recovery of investment and consumption in the second half of the year, China's economy will be likely able to achieve the annual GDP growth target of around 5.5 percent,"" Wei said.",SOURCE,ECONOMY,GDP Photo:VCG,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'China': ('LOC', 9), 'Russia': ('LOC', 1), 'Ukraine': ('LOC', 1), 'US': ('LOC', 1), 'Shanghai': ('LOC', 1), 'COVID': ('MISC', 1), '19': ('MISC', 3), 'COD': ('MISC', 4), 'National Bureau of Statistics': ('ORG', 1), 'NBS': ('ORG', 2), 'Yijin University': ('ORG', 1), 'Fu Linghui': ('PER', 1)}"
200,"US House hypes ‘China threat’ to boost military budget, shows sense of insecurity amid economic woes",Zhang Hui,2022-07-15,"The US House of Representatives on Thursday passed an annual defense policy bill for fiscal 2023, approving a $37 billion boost to the budget proposed by President Joe Biden in March. US lawmakers cited threats posed by Russia and China as well as inflation for the budget increase, which also contained several Taiwan-related bills with the aim of reinforcing relations between the US and Taiwan island. The record defense budget for fiscal 2023 may end up with an even higher final figure, and the US military budget won't have far to go to exceed $1 trillion, China analysts said. They believe that when the US feels economically insecure, it often tries to use force for the sake of seeking global hegemony, and the Taiwan-related part of the defense bill was an example of the US trying to use Taiwan island to contain China. But in fact, China is increasingly gaining an upper hand on the Taiwan question as well as China-US relations, and the US' sky-high budget will only end up in the pockets of arms dealers and make the US less secure, analysts said. The defense policy bill passed by the House authorized nearly $840 billion in defense spending for fiscal 2023, and House lawmakers cited high inflation, the Russia-Ukraine conflict and ""threats"" posed by China to justify adding $37 billion, according to the Wall Street Journal.Lü Xiang, a research fellow at the China Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times on Friday that the final figure for military spending in fiscal 2023 is likely to be higher than the figure passed by the House. The WSJ said lawmakers will work behind closed doors to reconcile both chambers' bills before sending compromise legislation to the president's desk for his signature.Lü said the Joe Biden administration still regards pushing for global hegemony with force as its top priority even when the US economy is in a very perilous state. The more economically insecure the US is, the more it wants to seek to meet security needs, but it cannot achieve absolute security even with sky-high military spending, he said. Song Zhongping, a China military expert and TV commentator, told the Global Times on Friday that sooner or later the US military budget will exceed $1 trillion, as the US will continue to raise its military spending to satisfy its military and global hegemonic ambitions.  Analysts said the US is sick, as it still feels insecure even when its military spending is equivalent to that of more than 100 countries. According to Taiwan media reports, the defense bill passed by the House contains the ""Taiwan Peace and Stability Act,"" which focuses on enhancing deterrence measures in the Taiwan Straits, and the ""Taiwan Fellowship Act,"" which will give US policymakers the opportunity to live and work in Taiwan island. The bill would also support the Joe Biden administration to invite Taiwan to join the Rim of the Pacific Exercise in 2024. Democratic Representative from California Ami Bera, who co-introduced the Taiwan Peace and Stability Act, said it signaled a path forward on US policy toward Taiwan and drove a government review of options to ""enhance deterrence over a cross-Strait conflict,"" according to a press release on Bera's website. Lü said it's not mandatory for Joe Biden to approve and implement the defense bill, and he doubted how much of it will actually be implemented. Song said that even if the US did invite Taiwan authorities for the 2024 military exercise, Taiwan would not play any significant part due to its weak military strength. Taiwan representatives would only be able to watch and have little practice during the exercise, as they cannot keep up with the US navy and its allies, Song said. After all, allowing the Taiwan authorities to participate was more about selling the island obsolete weapons made by the US, Song said. He believed the Taiwan Peace and Stability Act actually undermines peace and stability across the Taiwan Straits, and is an evil act. Lü said the US defense bill is testing China's resolve on reunification. ""China is increasingly gaining the upper hand over the Taiwan question and relations with the US,"" Lü said, listing the meeting between China State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi and US Secretary of State Antony Blinken in Bali as an example, during which Wang pointed out that the China-US three joint communiqués are the real ""guardrails"" for bilateral relations.China later described the meeting as ""constructive,"" and China observers noted the US may have also provided some positive indications during the talks. According zaobao.com based in Singapore, Li Mingjiang, associate professor at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore, said in commenting on the meeting that in the past, the US has always made demands of China. But this time, China has put the ball in the US court and showed that China is trying to seize the initiative in shaping China-US relations.",CHINA,MILITARY,"The guided-missile destroyer USS Sampson sailed through the Taiwan Straits on April 26, 2022.

201,"China’s H1 GDP up 2.5%, Q2 positive growth in hard-won outcome as nation braves headwinds",Xie Jun,2022-07-15,"From competitive high-tech manufacturing sector to higher than expected trade growth, China's economy managed to secure a positive growth in the second quarter against tough headwinds and achieve a V-shaped rebound with 2.5 percent growth in the first half of the year, a hard-won achievement considering the country's arduous fight with the most serious outbreaks of coronavirus since 2020 and a harsh external environment, officials and experts said as they further underlined the economic resilience and abilities of the nation of 1.4 billion people to brave challenges ahead. Although the impact of recent ordeal continues to linger in certain economic sectors, experts were generally upbeat about accelerating growth in the second half of this year as the effects of stimulus packages gradually come into force, which will provide momentum for the country's efforts to strive toward its economic growth target, they stressed. According to data released by the National Bureau of Statistics on Friday, China's GDP expanded 0.4 percent on a yearly basis in the second quarter, the slowest growth rate since the first quarter of 2020, when the domestic economy was battered by a ferocious outbreak of COVID-19 cases in Central China's Wuhan. The country's GDP growth was 4.8 percent in the first quarter. In the first half of 2022, China's GDP expanded by 2.5 percent from a year ago, the NBS data showed. China's economic slowdown came in the wake of Omicron outbreaks in some major metropolises including Shanghai which directly led to a shutdown of the city's activities for more than two months. The preventive measures also spilled over into surrounding areas in China's Yangtze River Delta, causing growth to slow in the region considered to be China's economic engine. Both experts and officials said that that China has experienced challenges and uncertainties, but the first half data, which showed a recovery trend, was proof that China has withstood these tests as it navigates through a tougher than ever environment which sees the global economy mired in a series of troubles, ranging from the pandemic to the Russia-Ukraine conflict to looming economic crises in many countries around the world, including the US.Fu Linghui, a spokesperson for the NBS, said on Friday that China's economy has overcome the negative impact of unexpected factors to show a stabilizing and improving trend. ""In particular, China has achieved positive economic growth in the second quarter and stabilized the economic situation. This is a hard-won outcome to have achieved,"" he said. Yao Jingyuan, a special researcher of the Counselors' Office of the State Council, said on Friday that China has experienced the test and achieved an economic rebound. ""This showed that China's economic abilities are strong,"" he noted. Specifically, China's economy showed stronger growth momentum, and presumably the most stable characteristics when compared with some other major world economies. The US economy, for example, is showing gloomy prospects amid problems like rising inflation, which have prompted overseas institutions to lower economic forecasts and even expressed concerns over a possible recession.Economists from Goldman Sachs have slashed their outlook for the US' Q2 GDP to just 0.7 percent from its previous estimate of a 1.9 percent increase, CNBC reported. The Atlanta Fed's GDPNow measure also saw the US' second-quarter output contract by 2.1 percent, another CNBC report showed. Japan's GDP growth shrank 0.9 percent in January-March from the previous quarter, as shown by revised Cabinet Office data.

Photo:XinhuaV-shaped recovery Interpreting China's recent economic trend, economists interviewed by the Global Times on Friday all noted that China's economy presented a healthy V-shaped recovery in the second quarter, which showed that the darkest period has now passed and the domestic economy is heading for further recovery in the second half of the year. ""China's economy entered a state of stabilization and rebound in May and June after experiencing a steep fall in April. This was triggered by policy efforts to stabilize economic operations, as well as by easing of uncertain factors such as COVID-19 prevention measures and external geopolitical frictions,"" Liu Dian, a deputy research fellow at the China Institute under Fudan University, told the Global Times on Friday.Yao also stressed that China's economy experienced a V-shaped recovery in the first six months, as domestic GDP continued to see relatively good growth in January and February, sloped down in March, slipped abruptly in April, and saw marginal improvement in May, while major economic indicators picked up in June. Looking closely at the Q2 economic figures, economists and organizations saw a divided situation in China's economy, with some sectors showing a trend of stabilization or even higher than expected performance, while others are still languishing after taking a severe blow from the recent woes. In Q2, the primary industry and the secondary industry of industrial production did much of the heavy lifting for the economy. The primary industry, mostly referring to agriculture, grew 4.4 percent in added value in Q2, the NBS data showed. This sector's steady growth provides a good foundation for China's economy, including many primary products' supplies and grain safety, Liu said.The rebound in industrial production also constituted a positive factor in China's recent economic operations. The value-added industrial output of major industrial enterprises rose 3.4 percent year-on-year in the first half of this year. It grew 3.9 percent in June, compared with 0.7 percent in May and a 2.9 percent decline in April. In particular, the surge of high-tech manufacturing industries was a bright spot for the domestic economy amid the pressures and uncertainties. In the first half of the year, China's high-tech manufacturing added value surged 9.6 percent, outpacing the average industrial growth by 6.2 percentage points. Production of new-energy vehicles, solar batteries and mobile telecom base station equipment surged by 111.2 percent, 31.8 percent and COVID-19.8 percent respectively, according to the NBS. ""The above-average growth speed of high-tech related industries when China's general economic situation was taking a relatively large blow shows that the sector has become a core and relatively certain momentum for economic growth,"" Liu said. Cong Yi, a professor at Tianjin University of Finance and Economics, also told the Global Times on Friday that China's economic rebound in June was largely due to the fundamentals of China's economy and the stability of China's production system. ""Once we can get production back in order, an economic rebound will follow,"" Cong said.Meanwhile, the trade sector also showed a brighter-than-expected growth trend. China's trade sector resumed a double-digit growth of 14.3 percent in June, compared with 9.5 percent growth in May, customs data showed on Wednesday. The strong economic performance in the aforementioned sectors has successfully offset contradictions in other sectors such as consumption and the housing market, and managed to push China's economy to a positive growth in the second quarter despite the challenges it experienced, experts said.

Photo:XinhuaStriving for the target Although China's slowing GDP growth has been held up by a number of overseas media outlets as ""proof"" of China's weakening economic prospects, a number of economic observers still felt upbeat about China's future economic operations, as they anticipated that the effects of China's stimulus measures will become clear in the coming months. Many of them also expressed confidence that China will still likely achieve its set GDP target, notwithstanding uncertainties, thanks to more supportive government measures and nationwide efforts. Zhou Maohua, a macroeconomic analyst at Everbright Bank, nevertheless pointed out China will hopefully achieve whole-year GDP, employment, product price and other targets, as China's stimulus policies for consumption, investment and other areas will continuously have their intended effects in the coming months. For example, China's increased infrastructure investment will help manufacturing industries maintain high prosperity and the property market to gradually recover. Consumption is also expected to speed up recovery as the impact from coronavirus wanes and effects of consumption stimulus policies start to have an effect. Wei Jianguo, vice chairman of the China Center for International Economic Exchange (CCIEE) and former vice minister of commerce, told the Global Times that China's economy has a chance of leaping to its stated target.""Foreign trade in the second half of the year will likely continue the momentum in the first half with double-digit growth expected. Meanwhile, with the recovery of investment and consumption in the second half of the year, China's economy will likely be able to achieve the annual GDP growth target of around 5.5 percent,"" Wei said.However, some experts also stressed that certain economic sectors are still stuck in the doldrums, and China's GDP growth in the first half of the year shows that the government needs to roll out more rigorous policies to propel the country to its 5.5 percent growth target.According to Liu, China's GDP needs to expand at 7 percent or 8 percent in the second half of this year in order for the country to achieve its set economic targets. This means the country needs a series of stronger than anticipated economic stimulus measures and policies to set off China's economic growth potential. He said that one important target of China's future economic work is to pull the tertiary industry, which has taken a relatively severe blow from COVID-19, back to the normal track. Retail sales, a main gauge of consumption, dropped by 4.6 percent in Q2, narrowing the gap from a slide of 6.7 percent in May, according to data from the NBS. It reversed from the decline to grow 3.1 percent in June. Liu also noted that China needs to create more economic growth points in the second half of the year, especially in areas like high-tech industries that already show good momentum. The country should also stick to the bottom line of preventing systemic risks to maintain a stable environment for the financial market and monetary policies, especially in areas that have shown some weakness recently such as the property market. According to Fu, although China's economic operations face multiple difficulties and challenges, the fundamentals of China's long-term economic improvement have not changed.

204,UN chief hails progress in talks over Ukraine grain exports,Xinhua,2022-07-14,"UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Wednesday hailed what he called ""substantive progress"" in ensuring the export of Ukraine food products through the Black Sea.""Today in Istanbul, we have seen a critical step forward to ensuring the safe and secure export of Ukraine food products through the Black Sea,"" he told reporters at the UN Headquarters in New York. ""In a world darkened by global crises, today, at last, we have a ray of hope -- a ray of hope to ease human suffering and alleviate hunger around the world, a ray of hope to support developing countries and the most vulnerable people, a ray of hope to bring a measure of much-needed stability to the global food system.""More technical work will be needed to materialize today's progress. But the momentum is clear. In the end, the aim of all parties is not just an agreement between Russia and Ukraine, but an agreement for the world, he said.He thanked the Turkey government for its outstanding efforts to convene the talks and its critical role going forward. He thanked Russia and Ukraine officials for their constructive engagement.""The UN pledges to do our full part to support the follow-up,"" he said. ""Today is an important and substantive step, a step on the way to a comprehensive agreement. We must also do more for struggling people and developing countries getting pummeled by a food, energy and financial crisis not of their making. We must do more to help all those living on the margins around the world -- countries on the brink of bankruptcy, families on the edge of famine.""There was very substantive progress and a broad agreement in the Istanbul talks, said Guterres.There was substantive agreement on many aspects, mainly the questions related to the mechanisms of control, to the system of coordination, and to demining, he said.""But of course, this was a first meeting. The progress was extremely encouraging. We hope that now the delegations are coming back to their capitals, and we hope that the next steps will allow US to come to a formal agreement,"" he said.The UN chief would not predict how soon a final agreement will be reached.""We are hoping that we'll be able to reconvene very soon -- I'm sure next week -- and hopefully we'll be able to have a final agreement. But as I said, we still need a lot of goodwill and commitment by all parties. They have shown it. I'm encouraged. I'm optimistic. But it's not yet fully done.""The UN will be together with Russia, Ukraine and Turkey in making sure that the next steps of coordination, of control, of the implementation, are done effectively. The UN is fully engaged in that common effort, he said.The progress in the Istanbul talks is an extremely relevant step in relation to addressing the food crisis, together with the efforts in relation to the access of Russia food and fertilizers to the global markets, he said. ""But I do not see immediately the perspective of a peace agreement. I think in any case, this demonstrated that the parties are able to have a constructive dialogue. And this is, of course, very good news. But for peace, we still have a long way to go.""The hopeful news from Istanbul shows the importance of dialogue, said Guterres.

205,Japan’s intensified link with NATO is a big concern for the region,Gong Xin,2022-07-14,"At the end of April, Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party proposed doubling the country's defense budget to a record-breaking $106 billion, up to 2 percent of Japan's annual GDP, citing the Russia-Ukraine conflict as a cause for concern while referring to NATO members' military spending standards. Japan Defense Minister Nobuo Kishi explained that the surge in defense spending is to give Japan ""counterstrike capabilities"" in the region.During the NATO Summit in late June, Japan prime minister Fumio Kishida called on the organization to shift its focus to Asia. It shows that Japan wants to strengthen its weak point in military through more frequent interaction with NATO and thus realize its ""great-power ambition"". In fact, right-wing politicians have long been attempting to change the country's pacifist constitution. They advocate increasing military spending and developing offensive weapons in order to shake off label on Japan as a defeated nation in World War II and thus realize the country's ""normalization"" on military forces. With such a scheme in mind, Japan has gone so far as to invite the world's largest military alliance, NATO, into the Asia-Pacific region, which has resulted in more tensions in the area.Article 9 of Japan's post-war constitution stipulates that Japan renounces war as a sovereign right of the nation and the threat or use of force as means of settling international disputes; Land, sea, and air forces, as well as other war potential, will never be maintained; The right of belligerency of the state will not be recognized.The main purpose is to prevent the revival of its expansionist ambitions. Article 9 together with the 1 percent GDP defense budget cap, and the ""Three Non-Nuclear Principles"" have combined to help ease the concerns of Asia countries once invaded by Japan. However, in recent years, Japan has been taking small but swift steps forward to break through its military restrictions, such as taking advantage of various opportunities to revise laws. What is even more alarming, amending Article 9, which is at the core of the pacifist constitution, has become a goal of the ruling party.Since the outbreak of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, Japan has been sensationalizing Ukraine's suffering, with the aim of gaining public support for its military buildup. However, surveys show nearly half of the Japan population opposes any amendment of Article 9. The Japan public is clearly against militarist expansion or getting involved in US-led wars.The Japan government's scheme is to free itself from the shackles of the past and normalize its military power gradually and unnoticeably, so that the world does not take any steps to thwart its plan until it's too late. With the US turning a blind eye, Japan's militarization has gone further and further and has far exceeded its defense needs in many aspects. Some Japan media pointed out that it is unreasonable for Japan, a country with no obligation to defend others, to align its defense budget with NATO members.Japan often uses North Korea, China and Russia as an excuse to promote its militarization, saying that it opposes ""changing the status quo by force"". However, it is Japan that unilaterally ""nationalized"" the disputed Diaoyu islands and is increasingly interfering in the Taiwan question and China Sea issue. Japan is the one who is changing the security conditions in Asia and exacerbating conflict. In addition, the so-called ""rules-based international order"" that Japan leaders often brag about is actually a ""hegemonic order"" dominated by a certain country and disguised as the ""international order"".To many Asia countries, the history of brutal invasion and occupation at the hands of Japan military is a memory they will never forget. However, 77 years after the end of the World War II, Japan does not seem to have learned the lessons of history and its post-war development. It is still insisting on militarization, and acting as a ""vanguard"" of NATO in Asia, which aggravates tensions in the region. These actions are driving the country further away from the pacifist spirit of its nationhood, which inevitably causes concern among its neighbors and far beyond.The author is an observer on international issues. opinion@globaltimes.com.cn",OPINION,VIEWPOINT,An excuse to militarize Illustration: Liu Rui/GT,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'Japan': ('LOC', 15), 'Ukraine': ('LOC', 3), 'Asia': ('LOC', 3), 'Pacific': ('LOC', 1), 'Liberal Democratic Party': ('ORG', 1), 'NATO': ('ORG', 3), 'Russia': ('MISC', 2), 'NATO Summit': ('MISC', 1), 'World War II': ('MISC', 1), 'Three Non - Nuclear Principles': ('MISC', 1), 'Nobuo Kishi': ('PER', 1), 'Fumio Kishida': ('PER', 1)}"
206,2030 will see China become a wealthy country,Global Times,2022-07-14,"Editor's Note: There have been many surprising events taking place in China over the past decade, and by 2030, China will become a country where everybody is richer, and where the digital economy is pervasive everywhere. This is what Mauro F. Guillen (Guillen), dean of the Cambridge Judge Business School and emeritus management professor at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, predicts China will look like in the next 10 years to come. After publishing the China edition of his book, 2030: How Today's Biggest Trends Will Collide and Reshape the Future of Everything, Guillen shares his view with Global Times (Global Times) reporter Li Aixin on a glimpse of future and how the greatest changes in this era will affect the geopolitical landscape across the globe.

Mauro F. Guillen Photo: Courtesy of GuillenGT: After you wrote the book, the world has witnessed COVID-19 pandemic, the Russia-Ukraine conflict, and a nose-diving China-US ties. In the final part of your book, you mentioned how COVID-19 will amplify and accelerate the changes in the world. Will the trends, which you analyzed in the book, be affected by other unexpected events?Guillen: The pandemic has been very consequential in terms of changing everything. But when you think about the three basic trends that I discussed in the book - demographics, economy, and technology - I think the pandemic has been a major accelerator of those trends. They have increased in terms of magnitude.For example, one key trend, the decline in the number of babies. As data shows, during 2020 and 2021, fewer babies were born because young couples, when confronted with all of the uncertainties about the pandemic, decided to postpone having babies. Then the other really important issue is the transformation of the economy. Emerging markets have done better in terms of economic growth than other markets in the world, especially those in Asia. Therefore, the gap between developed markets and the emerging markets has become smaller, which was already going on before the pandemic. And then the best example is technology adoption. Before the pandemic, very few of US were using digital platforms, such as the ones that we're using now. But now we do this every day for many hours. I spend hours and hours on Zoom every day. The rate of technological change, especially technological adoption, has actually accelerated as a result of the pandemic. My only regret is that instead of giving the book the title ""2030,"" I should have called it ""2028,"" because the future that I describe in the 2030 now is arriving much faster. Global Times: How about the mutual influence among wars, major powers relations, and the trends? How do they affect one another? Guillen: We're going to see certain aspects of globalization disappear because we're seeing more trade wars. We're seeing that companies prefer to source their products from closer locations to their home countries. We see even economic nationalism - countries in EU, in the US, deciding to manufacture what they need more at home. But at the same time, we're still in a global world from at least two very important perspectives. One is climate change. Whatever happens in one part of the world, we continue to affect the rest of the world in terms of climate change. The other one is technology and communications. There's nothing now stopping US from communicating really quickly.Global Times: Which countries or region will face the biggest influence of the eight major trends that you analyzed in the book?Guillen: The biggest impacts of these trends, the extreme cases, are in terms of demographics and technology and economy. Certainly, China, India, and the other emerging markets in Asia. From a demographic point of view, (the answer is) EU, because it (in demographic figures) is declining as fast as that in East Asia. On the other extreme, I think the biggest changes that we're going to see in the next few years will happen in Africa, in particular, in sub-Saharan Africa, because we're going to see a major population increase. Also, digital technology is very much adopted in Africa. They use mobile phones for things that we don't use for, for example, telemedicine or for electronic payments, for mobile banking. I see more changes taking place in those parts of the world than in others.Global Times: Would you make a value judgment of the trends? Which are positive ones and which are negative? Guillen: The biggest positive trend has to do with the economy. We continue to see that the middle class is expanding in China, in the rest of East Asia, in India, and also in Africa. This is very important because essentially when the middle class expands, people are being lifted out of poverty. That is a very good thing that continues to go on in spite of the pandemic in the world. Unfortunately, this is not happening in EU and the US, and also not in Latin US, where the middle class has stagnated. What we see is this bifurcation in the world in terms of this good news. I also believe it's good news that the number of children being born is declining, especially in parts of the world where it is still very high, like four or five children per woman. By the same token, perhaps the number of babies per woman is declining fast in China, in EU, and in the US. It's good news because we can better address problems such as overpopulation, the pressure on natural resources, climate change. But it's bad news as well, because it also means aging of the population. That puts pressure on pensions, on healthcare. And younger generations complain that they have to pay too many taxes. Global Times: Should and could people intervene in the trends?Guillen: It is important to understand two basic things. One is that people make decisions, individuals make decisions, families make decisions, for example, about how many babies they want to have. We also make decisions at a national level as to what kind of a society we want to be. We make decisions about the economy, infrastructure, and so on. So, the world is a very complex place. What is really important is that we have a little bit more collaboration, more dialogue, more cooperation between governments in the world, which is something that over the last 10 years or so has been missing. This is not good. I don't think that really helps in any way. Global Times: If we look back over the past decade, are there any changes and developments in China that might have surprised you?Guillen: There are many things that have surprised me. One is the really fast pace of economic growth, the growth of the cities. This is something that has completely changed China. China used to be a very rural country 50 years ago, but today it is predominantly an urban country with so many big cities. The other thing is the expansion around the world of leading China brands and companies. This has also been fast and is good for the world. I am happy about the new economic stature of China. It is also important that China becomes a positive force in the world through collaboration, cooperation, with the biggest countries in the world.Global Times: How do you think China will look like in 2030?Guillen: It's going to be a country with fewer young people and more people above the age of 60. It's going to be a country where everybody is going to be richer than today. It's going to be a country where the digital economy is pervasive everywhere. Hopefully it will be a country that will play a very important role in the world, a constructive one collaborating with other countries, including the US. One of my most important wishes for the future is that China and US sit together at the table, discuss the problems of the world, and try to overcome them for all of US. China and the US will be the largest economies in the world. They will also be the technology power houses in the world. So, it's really important that happens. Global Times: You mentioned that China will be the world's largest economy and consumer market in 2030. How will China-US ties look like by then? Will it be worse than it is now? Or will the two countries find more common ground for coexistence?Guillen: I hope we can have more collaboration between the two countries. I do believe that the US is going to continue being a very important economy in the world. It may not be the largest, but technologically it will still be very important. But China will become the biggest economy and also very important technologically. In the world, we have everything to benefit if the two collaborate. That is my wish. I think in general, the population in US wants to be friendly with all of the other major places in the world. There are geopolitical frictions over security arrangements in Asia. The US, if you remember, started to have interest in Asia over 100 years ago, when it took over from Spain, the Philippine islands. That was the first time that the US had a strong presence in Asia. Since then, especially after World War II, we've seen more security commitments by the US. It is very complex, but that's precisely where I'm saying that we need to have China and US sitting at the same table. Global Times: In general, how will today's biggest trends influence geopolitics? Could there be a cold war in the post-2030 era, or even more hot wars?Guillen: We're going to see frictions, but I wouldn't call it a cold war. It's very different from the Cold War between the US and the Soviet Union. For a very simple reason - the US and the Soviet Union didn't have many economic ties. They almost didn't trade with one another. They didn't have mutual investment connections. But the US and China are both very important trading partners for each other. There are also a lot of China investments in US treasury bonds. There are a lot of US investments in China. The extent to which China and the US are interrelated, economically and financially, is very different from the situation when we have the Soviet Union and the US. There may be frictions, differences of opinion between China and US. But these are still two economies that are closely related to one another. Global Times: It seems decoupling has been going on for some time.Guillen: Yes, that is the counterpoint. We want to have these two countries being willing to sit at the table to collaborate, to cooperate. Otherwise, we're going to see a world very difficult to manage.Global Times: The China edition of your book has been published recently. Do you have any suggestions for China's young people, in terms of how to face the post-2030 world? They seem to face more challenges and uncertainties than their peers in other countries.Guillen: For young people in China, I would have three very clear messages. The first one is try and learn about all of these trends, because you need to have a sense as to what's going on in the world. The second thing, they have to prepare themselves, but they have to be optimistic. They have to look for the opportunities that are hidden behind all of these events. The third thing is that we are in an uncertain world. There's no question about it. Every few months we have another crisis. We have another moment in which we feel that everything is changing. Whenever that happens, what I would strongly suggest to them, which is what I proposed in the book in the last chapter, is that you should never make decisions that are irreversible. You should preserve as many degrees of freedom as possible. So in other words, make decisions that you can later adjust, that you can later change, as you see how the situation evolves. I would like to share in general, this sense of optimism. We have big problems in the world, but we also have big opportunities. And therefore, what I think we need to do is to study those opportunities very carefully and to pursue them. There are opportunities in every part of the world, more importantly, there are key advantages from collaboration and cooperation among countries in the world.

207,China able to maintain stable CPI in stark contrast to West: official,Ma Jingjing,2022-07-14,"While major economies such as the US and the EU are grappling with record high inflation, China will see its consumer price index (CPI) remain in a reasonable range, and is capable of attaining its 3-percent annual target despite the fallout of COVID-19 resurgences and the Russia-Ukraine conflict, a senior China official said on Thursday.Due to soaring international energy and grain prices since the beginning of this year, the US and the EU saw their domestic inflation rates stay above 8 percent in recent months, with the US' CPI quickening to a fresh 40-year record of 9.1 percent in June.""In stark contrast, China's CPI persistently runs within a reasonable range, with the index rising 1.7 percent in the first half of the year, significantly lower than other major economies,"" Wan Jinsong, director of the Price Department at the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), said at a press conference on Thursday.Fully reflecting the advantages of socialism with China characteristics as well as the country's remarkable achievement in ensuring the supply of important livelihood products and key bulk commodities, China's food prices have risen only about 1.4 percent since the start of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, far lower than the US' and the EU's price hikes of 7.5-9.5 percent, according to Wan.Meanwhile, the prices of electricity and gas for residential use in China maintained basic stability thanks to measures to increase coal supply and ensure reasonable coal prices, Wan said, noting that major economies, however, saw sharp price rises. For instance, the power price in the eurozone jumped about 30 percent year-on-year in May, while the natural gas price surged around 50 percent, he said.Apart from factors such as China's prudent monetary policies, China's capability in stabilizing goods prices by adjusting supply also contributed to a low but reasonable CPI level in China, Li Changan, a professor at the Academy of China Open Economy Studies of the University of International Business and Economics, told the Global Times on Thursday.""The central government is good at adjusting the prices of basic commodities, such as oil and minerals, as well as food by releasing reserves when it's necessary or taking other measures,"" Li said. In a bid to attain this year's CPI goal, the NDRC will continue to closely follow overall consumer prices and the price trends of key commodities, strengthen market adjustment and boost the implementation of policies for stabilizing consumer prices, Wan stressed.Although the global grain market is facing volatility and increasing uncertainty due to the impact of a variety of factors including the pandemic, extreme weather and major developed economies' monetary tightening, ""we have the capability, confidence and conditions to deal with external shocks and hold our rice bowls firmly in our own hands,"" Zhang Guohua, deputy head of the economic and trade department at the NDRC, said at the same conference.China saw another bumper summer harvest this year.

208,Sporadic COVID-19 resurgences in China will not stop economic recovery: expert,GT staff reporters,2022-07-14,"China reported 86 domestically transmitted COVID-19 cases as some cities see sporadic resurgences, but analysts are optimistic that the country's overall economic recovery will not be affected as cities have gained experience in epidemic prevention. The strong resilience of China's economy, complete industrial layout, fast-developing digital economy and large markets are sources of confidence for the country's economic recovery in the second half of 2022, despite West media bad-mouthing.Some cities in China have experienced COVID-19 flare-ups related to the Omicron subvariant BA.5 in recent days. Among the 86 domestic cases registered on Wednesday, 36 were in China's Gansu Province and 32 in China's Guangdong Province. Jiangxi, Hainan, Jiangsu, Henan, Chongqing and Shanghai also reported cases.Lanzhou in Gansu Province put four districts under a seven-day control procedure starting on Monday, asking people to stay inside their residential compounds. The sporadic outbreaks raised questions on prospects for the country's economy, which just started to recover from the impact of outbreaks in megacities Shanghai and Beijing, as well as smaller cities. ""The latest sporadic resurgences across China may influence certain industry chains in some cities, but they won't affect China's overall economic recovery,"" Cao Heping, an economist at Peking University, told the Global Times. Cao noted that the previous outbreaks in Shanghai and Beijing - two of China's most populated cities -- taught the country lessons about dealing with Omicron. Cities have improved screening, tracing and treatment of cases with more precise and targeted measures, said Cao. In good news, Beijing had no high-risk areas as of Thursday and Anhui Province, which was battered by a sudden outbreak last week, reported zero cases on Thursday.West media seize every virus resurgence in China as a chance to criticize China's dynamic zero-COVID-19 policy and keep bad-mouthing China's economy. Reuters reported on Thursday that China ""has been tweaking its stringent COVID-19 curbs but shows no sign of backing off,"" which leaves businesses ""facing a prolonged period of uncertainty."" But according to Cao, who visited dozens of China cities in coastal and inland areas since April, the dynamic zero-COVID-19 policy helps create a better environment for an economic recovery and the resilience of the country's economy is stronger than many had predicted. China will release second-quarter GDP growth data soon, and some foreign media predicted it to be just 1 percent. Cao predicted that GDP growth for the first half of the year may stand between 0.7 and 2.7 percent, and the economic recovery in the second half may speed up.""In Kunshan, a city close to Shanghai that was affected by the outbreak in Shanghai, local officials and companies told me that export-oriented parts of the economy started to recover since June. The dynamic zero-COVID-19 policy makes exports from China virus-free and clients are also assured about this ... overseas orders have been restored and increased,"" said Cao.China's industrial layout is complete, meaning that an epidemic in one city or area may temporarily affect production but that can be compensated for through adjustment in other links of the manufacturing process, Cao said. In response to pessimistic West predictions, Cao said that in world history, countries with better resilience, complete industrial chains and a bigger economic scale usually had quicker recoveries after global strikes. China's fast-developing digital economy, e-commerce platforms and large domestic market - all of these mean China's economy can survive and thrive, Cao said. On Thursday, the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) held a press conference on the economic situation in the first half of 2022, and it said that China suffered economic fluctuations between March and mid-May due to the domestic epidemic resurgence, supply shocks, the Ukraine crisis and other unexpected factors. But with the effective COVID-19 prevention measures in key areas and the release of steady economic policies, the economy turned upward in June.The Purchasing Managers' Index in June was 50.2, increasing 0.6 points from May. Foreign trade has also grown fast since June, according to the NDRC, which predicted the economy in the second half of 2022 will maintain an upward trend with the highly effective COVID-19 control policy and macroeconomic policies.",CHINA,SOCIETY,"Photo taken on July 2, 2022 shows the view of a commercial street in Wuhan, central China's Hubei Province.

But given the effects of previous sanctions, especially recent moves by Canada and the EU, China experts said these sanctions have failed to achieve their aims in the short term, and the EU is becoming more aware of the fact that the union will suffer more damage if it continues to follow the US in increasing sanctions against Russia.Preparations by EU ambassadors for the new, seventh package are to resume on Thursday and Friday, and are likely to be approved by member states by the middle of next week, several EU diplomats told EURACTIV.It will also widen a list of dual-use goods banned for export to Russia and include more listings of individuals and entities tied to Russia President Vladimir Putin's wider circle, EURACTIV reported, citing several EU diplomats.Some member states continue to push for more measures on energy to be added to the next packages, while other EU diplomats stress there is no chance for such an option, as a number of EU countries remain highly dependent on Russia energy imports, especially gas, according to media reports. Czech Prime Minister Petr Fiala told Reuters on Wednesday, ""The EU is preparing a seventh package of sanctions against Moscow but it is already clear that it will not curb imports of Russia gas as too many member states can't adjust quickly enough.""The move was agreed at a G7 summit last month by EU members France, Germany and Italy with their counterparts from the US, Canada, Japan and the UK. The first six rounds of sanctions included asset freezes and visa bans on Russia oligarchs and officials, export controls, freezing central bank assets, cutting banks out of the SWIFT messaging system and banning imports of Russia coal and oil.It also came amid US President Joe Biden's ongoing visit to the Middle East, as observers believe the US could launch a ""Middle East NATO"" to counter Iran and convince Gulf states to increase global oil supplies to ease the energy crisis caused by the Ukraine crisis and the West sanctions against Russia.  ""The so-called seventh round of sanctions aims to impose sustained pressure on Russia. Such pressure cannot stop, just like the aid to Ukraine, but it does not matter what kind of sanctions they are,"" Cui Hongjian, director of the Department of EU Studies at the China Institute of International Studies, told the Global Times on Thursday.However, the sanctions could be largely symbolic, as the EU is divided on this issue, Cui said. Some countries that have cut their dependence on Russia gas are more active in pushing it forward, but others would be more hesitant as such a ban would have a huge effect on them, the expert noted. Since the outbreak of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, the US has been trying to incite EU countries to provide assistance to Ukraine and launch multiple rounds of sanctions against Russia. As the sanctions escalated, the US, which is less dependent on energy and trade with Russia, suffered less damage. However, EU countries, which have a very close and interdependent relationship with Russia in industry and energy, have faced and experienced a massive backlash on their enterprises and people's lives. An article entitled ""How Russia broke the blockade of Kaliningrad"" published by Russia newspaper Vzglyad on Thursday said the West has backed away from sanctions against Russia for the second time in recent days, citing Canada's plan to allow the delivery of a key component to help deliver Russia gas to Germany, despite appeals from Ukraine to hold off on returning the equipment.Meanwhile, the EU has sought to reduce tensions with Moscow over Kaliningrad by indicating it was not seeking to block shipments of sanctioned goods from reaching the Russia territory, Financial Times reported on Wednesday. Following weeks of tensions among Moscow, Lithuania and the EU that Reuters said tested EU's resolve to enforce sanctions on Russia, Lithuania said on Wednesday that it will allow sanctioned Russia goods to transit its territory on their way to Russia's Kaliningrad exclave, reversing its policy after new EU Commission guidelines.Bordered by EU states, Kaliningrad, which relies on railways and roads through Lithuania for most of its goods, has had some freight transport from Russia cut off since June 17 under sanctions imposed by Brussels.""The West's sanctions against Russia are now unsustainable, as the double-edged nature of sanctions is becoming increasingly obvious. The risk of inflation, and even economic recession, stagflation, now hangs over the world economy. EU countries have begun to question whether they have been fooled by the US,"" Wang Yiwei, director of the Institute of International Affairs at the Renmin University of China, told the Global Times on Thursday. Leading the world comes at a price, and whether the US still has the ability to lead an anti-Russia alliance is questionable as the country is weighed down by its own domestic problems, Wang said. Cui said it will take some time for the sanctions to be implemented, and EU countries have their own calculations on when to take real actions. China analysts said that from the perspective of short-term results, the sanctions have failed to achieve their aims. But the majority of EU countries are waiting for the full impact of sanctions to be manifested on the Russia economy.Whether they will have a great influence in the long term is not yet known, but sanctions are not the right way to stop a conflict, they said, stressing that the Ukraine crisis can only be resolved through dialogue and negotiation.",CHINA,DIPLOMACY,"Flags of the EU fly outside the EU headquarters in Brussels, Belgium, May 21, 2021.

212,Yangtze Delta region contributes nearly 40% of China's foreign trade in June after shrugging off epidemic impact: Customs,Global Times,2022-07-13,"The Yangtze River Delta region, home to one quarter of China's economy, witnessed rising foreign trade as the region shrugged off the epidemic impact. A customs official said that the region contributed nearly 40 percent of China's foreign trade in June.The total import and export of Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Anhui provinces and Shanghai in the Yangtze River Delta was 7.14 trillion yuan ($1.06 trillion) in the first half of this year, a year-on-year increase of 9.3 percent, Li Kuiwen, spokesperson of General Administration of Customs of China, said on Wednesday.Among them, the foreign trade in June was 1.39 trillion yuan, a year-on-year increase of 14.9 percent, which was 0.6 percentage points higher than the overall national growth rate in the same period, and contributed nearly 40 percent to the national foreign trade growth, Li noted.Foreign trade of Shanghai, the city which was most affected by the epidemic, returned to positive growth in June, with a year-on-year increase of 9.6 percent and a month-on-month increase of 35.6 percent, Li said. Li said the regions, including the Yangtze River Delta region, Pearl River Delta and the Northeast China have assured the growth of foreign trade, which in detail saw a growth of 14.9 percent, 6.4 percent and 12.8 percent in June, and higher than their performance in May. China reported a foreign trade of COVID-19.8 trillion yuan in the first half of this year, a positive year-on-year growth for eight consecutive quarters.Li said the growth of foreign trade is mainly attributed to a stable overseas demand and sufficient domestic production demand.Despite the increase in external environmental risks and challenges caused by the epidemic and the Ukraine crisis, overall, the global economy is still showing a recovery trend, Li said. In the first half of the year, China's exports of electrical equipment, integrated circuits and automobiles increased by 24.8 percent, 16.4 percent and 51.1 percent respectively.Although local outbreaks have occurred in the Yangtze River Delta, the Pearl River Delta and Northeast China since the beginning of this year, resulting in a decline of foreign trade, the regions have showed an upward growth trend from negative to positive, which ""maintained the fundamentals of the stable growth of national foreign trade,"" Li said. China's economic resilience, potential, long-term positive fundamentals have not changed, and China's foreign trade is expected to continue to maintain stable growth with the resumption of work and production continuing in an orderly manner, the Customs official said.",SOURCE,ECONOMY,File photo shows a view of the Lujiazui area in Shanghai.Photo:Xinhua,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'Yangtze River Delta': ('LOC', 3), 'Jiangsu': ('LOC', 1), 'Zhejiang': ('LOC', 1), 'Anhui': ('LOC', 1), 'Shanghai': ('LOC', 2), 'Pearl River Delta': ('LOC', 2), 'Northeast China': ('LOC', 7), 'Ukraine': ('LOC', 1), 'Yangtz': ('LOC', 1), 'River Delta': ('LOC', 1), 'Li Kuiwen': ('PER', 7), 'General Administration of Customs of China': ('ORG', 1)}"
213,Biden can hardly save US declining influence in Middle East,Ding Long,2022-07-13,"US President Joe Biden is set to embark on his first trip to the Middle East since taking office. Despite it being a routine visit, the trip has attracted extensive attention from global media and has been strongly questioned by US political circles and public opinion. In the face of such criticism, Joe Biden wrote an article and had it published on US Post on July 9, attempting to find noble excuses for his Middle East visit. This rare move reflects the huge controversy triggered by the trip.One primary reason why Joe Biden's trip to the Middle East has attracted much attention is that the visit contains several paradoxes. First, Joe Biden, who promised during his 2020 presidential campaign to make Saudi Arabia a ""pariah,"" bowed to reality and has been forced to schedule the visit for increasing oil supplies. This means the Joe Biden doctrine, based on ""democracy"" and ""values"" diplomacy, has collapsed. Second, Joe Biden made reviving the Iran nuclear deal a key priority as he entered the Oval Office. When negotiations stalled, the White House urged Arab countries to team up with Israel to counter Iran. This move will irritate Iran and complicate the talks. Third, although the Joe Biden administration has been determined to reduce its commitment to the Middle East, in a bid to deal with China and Russia, it is reluctant to lose its hegemony in the region. As a result, the Joe Biden administration is attempting to increase its presence in the Middle East through visits and building deeper military ties in order to maintain its fragile Middle Eastern alliance system. Fourth, even though Joe Biden is set to visit Israel and Palestine, seemingly to promote peace in the region, he has avoided the Palestine issue, a root cause of Middle East issues. The US' Middle East peace agenda has actually been kidnapped by Israel. When the Palestine issue has been marginalized, the US instead promoted the normalization of relations between Israel and some Arab countries, glorifying it as a Middle East peace breakthrough. Such practices are in fact detrimental to achieving real peace in the region.Joe Biden's Middle East tour may seem quite high-profile and the US president wishes to showcase US leadership, but against the backdrop of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, global and regional geopolitical landscapes have undergone drastic changes. This will make it harder for Joe Biden to reach his goal. Ultimately, the trip will turn out to be no more than a photo op.To begin with, the goal for an increased oil supply will be hard to reach. Joe Biden wants oil producers in the region to increase oil production and supply for EU. This will, on the one hand, reduce the negative impact of the West's sanctions on Russia, on the other, resolve the problems of soaring oil prices, inflation, economy and people's livelihood. The US will hold its midterm elections in a few months and its presidential election in two years. Joe Biden wants to get reelected. To save his popularity, he has to go to the Middle East. As for the interests of US Middle Eastern allies, this is not in Joe Biden's consideration. Second, Joe Biden's vision of a Middle East security plan will intensify regional bloc confrontation. During this visit, Joe Biden will hold a summit with Arab allies in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia and aim to establish a ""Middle East Air Defense Alliance"" against Iran. The US is attempting to turn it into a ""Middle East version of NATO.""However, the alliance would be limited to only primary military cooperation, which is far from a complete and real military alliance. The US only uses it to appease its Middle Eastern allies and to palter with those allies' security demands. In addition, different perceptions of the so-called Iran threat among members determine that the ""Middle Eastern version of NATO"" lacks substance and is doomed to fail. However, this alliance, which is of more symbolic significance, will deal a blow to the easing relations among major countries in the Middle East, and may force countries in the region onto the old path of confrontation. Third, it's difficult for the US to stop the decline of its alliance system in the Middle East. US has only paid lip services to its allies in the region, not satisfying their security demands, and it still clings to human rights diplomacy, all of which have undermined allies' strategic trust in the US. The alliance relationship is hard to return to what it was in the past. Since the Russia-Ukraine conflict broke out, the international energy supply crisis has greatly boosted the strategic independence and confidence of oil-producing countries such as Saudi Arabia. They don't buy the US' hypocritical Middle East policy any more. The US strategic contraction in the Middle East has made their illusion of US protection vanish into thin air. Major power competition provides greater strategic space for Middle Eastern countries, whose national interests have become more diversified. This determines that they won't take sides among major powers as US has demanded, but instead, will continue to maintain close cooperation with China and Russia. The Middle East diplomacy of the Joe Biden administration is full of paradoxes. Joe Biden's Middle East trip is being carried out in a high-profile manner, but this cannot change the fact that he will return empty-handed, nor can it save the US decline in the Middle East.The author is a professor of the Middle East Studies Institute at Shanghai International Studies University. opinion@globaltimes.com.cn",OPINION,VIEWPOINT,"US President Joe Biden makes his way to board Air Force One before departing from Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland on July 12, 2022.",Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'US': ('LOC', 6), 'Middle East': ('LOC', 9), 'Saudi Arabia': ('LOC', 1), 'Iran': ('LOC', 3), 'Oval Office': ('LOC', 1), 'White House': ('LOC', 1), 'Israel': ('LOC', 4), 'China': ('LOC', 1), 'Russia': ('LOC', 2), 'Palestine': ('LOC', 3), 'Ukraine': ('LOC', 1), 'Joe Biden': ('PER', 10), 'Joe B': ('PER', 2), 'US Post': ('ORG', 1), 'Arab': ('MISC', 2), 'Middle Eastern': ('MISC', 1), 'B': ('MISC', 1)}"
214,"Australia should focus on persuading US to work with China, than forcing it to accept hegemony",John Lander,2022-07-13,"The recent Federal election in Australia saw each side using the ""China Threat"" against the other in a competition of political correctness - a form of group-think in which a particular view is accepted as a consensus, without any objective analysis of available evidence.It was a sign of the success of the relentless mainstream media campaign pushed by the ASPI, the Australia Strategic Policy Institute (more aptly characterized as ""US Strategic Propaganda Institute"") which resulted in a majority of the population reversing its view of China from friend to foe, according to the most recent Lowy Institute study.There was one difference, however. The Coalition, at its own cost, called into question the loyalty of China Australia citizens, seeing them all as potential agents of the Communist Party of China.The message has not been entirely lost on Labor. In her meeting in Bali on July 8 with China State Councilor and Foreign Minister, Wang Yi, Australia's new Foreign Minister, Penny Wong, was careful to highlight the value of ""people-to-people ties."" Her statement that ""the Australia Government will always seek to resolve issues calmly and consistently under our Comprehensive Strategic Partnership and in accordance with our national interests"" was a welcome move away from the hysterical tone of the Coalition. In a rather contradictory vein, however, Prime Minister Albanese continues to perpetuate the myth that Australia is blameless and that the frosty relationship of the past several years is entirely China's fault.He pretends not to know that Australia reneged on its signature of the Free Trade Agreement with China almost as soon as the ink was dry. It imposed barriers on China exports of goods, technology and investment into Australia, contrary to rulings of the WTO, years before China responded with similar barriers to selected Australia exports to China.Australia also impeded legitimate promotion of China's academic, cultural and scientific interests in, which was no more than an emulation of UK, US, and Japan (to name but a few of many other countries). US's efforts to isolate China diplomatically, technologically, and economically puts Australia's prosperity at risk. China's market for Australia exports is larger than many other export markets combined.Penny Wong's calm and measured tone has nevertheless not led to an overall shift in Australia policy. China media observed that: ""Australia is still on the US bandwagon, but it's no longer riding the shotgun."" Prime Minister Albanese's grandstanding at the NATO Summit and in Ukraine, continues to lock Australia into the role of facilitator of US dominance in the Asia Pacific. The US perceives China as the main threat to its ""rules-based"" international financial order. The progress China has made at the BRICS Summit, held at the same time as the antagonistic NATO Summit, towards the establishment of a common currency of transaction based on an agreed basket of commodities, certainly has the potential to undermine the US dollar as the global reserve currency.Australia is intricately intertwined in the US ""rules-based order"" and will continue to feel obliged to adopt an antithetical approach to China. The almost complete fusion of Australia military forces with those of the US virtually guarantees Australia involvement in any hostilities instigated by US.Australia could further defuse tensions with China, while not moving away from its ""joined at the hip"" partnership with the US, if it were to publicly restate Joe Biden's adherence to the ""One China Principle"" and his assurances (however disingenuous) that the renewed alliances were ""not directed at China."" Australia acknowledgement of China's right to conduct ""freedom of navigation"" exercises off the coast of Australia, mirroring Australia's insistence on continuing such operations off the coast of China, might require a too difficult disavowal of hypocrisy at this stage.The aforementioned Lowy report also found that a majority of Australians are opposed to going to war against China. If Labor has learned anything from the election results, it would direct its diplomatic efforts more towards persuading the US to work with China for global prosperity, rather than towards persuading China that it must accept US global primacy.The author was Deputy Ambassador to China 1974-76.

215,Japan shouldn’t bring Cold War rearmament to Asia,Ding Gang,2022-07-13,"Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) scored a sweeping victory in Sunday's House of Councillors election, winning more than half of the seats up for grabs. LDP's coalition partner Komeito won 13 seats. Their victory means political forces, especially the LDP, supportive of revising Japan's pacifist constitution, retain a two-third majority in the upper house, breaking the ""threshold"" needed to start a motion to amend the constitution. Japan Prime Minister Fumio Kishida will not pass by the opportunity when the constitutional revisionists are dominating the upper house. Right-wing tendencies will increase, a constitutional amendment will definitely move forward. Given the changing security landscape around Japan, the election result is seen as an opportunity for Japan to get rid of the restrictions posed by the post-war pacifist constitution so that Japan can rearm itself and become a ""normal country"" with an independent army and the permanent power to send troops abroad. This has been a long-term goal established by former prime minister Shinzo Abe, who was assassinated on July 8.Of course, the possibility of revising the constitution will depend on public opinion in Japan, which is greatly influenced by changes in the security environment on this issue. It will also depend on whether a rearmed Japan will be accepted by the US in its strategic reorientation toward China.The US played an important role behind the rearmament of West Germany back in the 1950s. The aim was, of course, to consolidate its leadership of the West bloc, including keeping West Germany in the bloc while preventing it from re-Nazification, to counter the Soviet Union.France, which had been invaded by Germany several times in the last 100 years of its history, strongly opposed to rearming West Germany. At the time, chancellor of West Germany Konrad Adenauer told France leaders that the threat came not from West Germany's rearmament, but from further East. A cartoon drawn by Germany cartoonist Brockmann in January 1955, with the caption, ""The enemy is in the East. And what will happen, dear Pierre, when I won't be there to stand between them anymore"" took an ironic look at the mistrust of then France Council of Ministers president Pierre Mendès concerning the rearmament of West Germany.In October 1954, the US, the UK and France negotiated and signed the Paris Agreement with West Germany, legally ending the occupation of West Germany and recognizing the Federal Republic of Germany as a sovereign state.The Paris Agreement was the starting point for West Germany's reintegration into the West society and it cleared the diplomatic and political obstacles for West Germany to rebuild its military.Allied forces stationed in West Germany gradually shifted their focus from their original mission of preventing the resurgence of Germany militarism to another mission of assisting in the defense of West Germany and EU. West Germany became a member of NATO, and a unified Germany naturally became the backbone of the NATO bloc after 1990. With the Russia-Ukraine conflict, the security landscape in EU has once again changed significantly. Germany has launched a plan to increase defense spending. Chancellor Olaf Scholz said on June 7 that Germany would increase military investment to strengthen the protection of NATO's eastern flank, allocate a ""special fund"" for the modernization of the armed forces, and strengthen NATO's military forces to make Germany ""the strongest armed forces in EU and one of the strongest in NATO."" Similarly, the changing security landscape in East Asia is being made use of by Japan politicians as a reason to rearm Japan, and public opinion is deeply influenced by it.The LDP's Research Commission on Security has also recommended that Japan raise military spending to 2 percent of its GDP within five years, citing the rising military capabilities of neighboring countries as a ""major threat"" to Japan. Kishida recently stated that the Japan government has no intention of discussing a ""nuclear sharing"" policy under which the US nuclear weapons would be deployed on Japan territory for joint use. But there is no problem for the LDP and other parties or Japan people to discuss the matter.A scene that happened in EU seems to be repeating itself in East Asia. This time the ""enemy"" is perceived to be from the West.But there is a fundamental difference in East Asia between the Cold War era and now. The three major economies - China, Japan and South Korea - are in a state of deep integration in terms of their economic, trade and civil relations. Despite the intense competition among the three countries in terms of technology and markets, none of them are willing to completely sever these connections.Therefore, the future direction of the regional security situation, especially the direction of the US' decoupling strategy toward China, will have a strong impact on this linkage. If the three countries fail to make sustained progress in economic, trade, and civil engagement, the wedge driven by the US will continue to widen the rift.Thus, Japan's rearmament and the revision of its pacifist constitution is both a Japan issue and a larger regional security issue, depending on how Japan will respond to the US ""Indo-Pacific Strategy"" and the rise of China. Whether Japan can rearm itself is a matter for Japan, but if this rearmament is directed at China, it is destined to be a dangerous move.China does not have to sit idly by on this issue, and China has many options to choose in response.The author is a senior editor with People's Daily, and currently a senior fellow with the Chongyang Institute for Financial Studies at Renmin University of China. dinggang@globaltimes.com.cn.

216,Biden’s Mideast trip would find ‘dilemma between confronting Iran and sanctioning Russia’,Yang Sheng,2022-07-13,"US President Joe Biden arrived in Tel Aviv on Wednesday, kicking off his trip to the Middle East as observers expect that the US could launch a ""Middle East NATO"" to counter Iran and to convince Gulf states to increase global oil supplies to ease the energy crisis caused by the Ukraine crisis and the West sanctions against Russia.  China analysts said Joe Biden would find a dilemma between these two goals, and with the declining US influence in the region, the US is unlikely to be able to form a new military alliance with significant power.After the Ukraine crisis, the US is trying to make NATO more globalized or copy the model of such a military alliance in other regions like the Asia-Pacific and the Middle East, using disputes or divergences among regional countries to intensify bloc-to-bloc confrontations as has already happened in EU, said analysts. The US attempt is unlikely to be realized due to the complicated regional situation, they said.Qiu Wenping, an expert on Middle East studies and a Fudan University professor, told the Global Times on Wednesday that the US is pulling out from the Middle East as its hegemony is declining. ""This time Joe Biden is trying to make a big plan to pacify concerns among its regional allies as they worry the US pullout could bring new uncertainties,"" Qiu said.The plan mainly aims to form an anti-Iran alliance with cooperation between Saudi Arabia-led Gulf states and Israel, and also contain the expansion of Turkey in the region, as well as stopping regional countries from cooperating with Russia and China, Qiu noted. However, such a plan would be extremely difficult, said analysts. The relationship between Israel and Saudi Arabia is shaky, because it is impossible for the US to totally change the hostile ties between Israel and Islamic world. ""So even if Saudi Arabia really wants to reinforce ties with the US, it dares not align with Israel,"" Qiu said. She noted that if the US does not increase troop numbers in the region, the possibility of more chaos in the region would be bigger than the establishment of a new military alliance. According to an article published by the National Interest on Saturday, the Abraham Accords, a joint statement pushed by the Donald Trump administration to normalize ties between Israel and Arab countries, made it easier for Israel and Arab countries to coordinate militarily, notably to create a regional air defense alliance ― the Middle East Air Defense Alliance  (MEAD) － to counter ""threats from Iran.""But Politico quoted experts and officials as saying that ""continued mistrust and technological differences"" mean this kind of idea could be years away. For instance, one problem is that Saudi Arabia and the UAE also operate China and Russia systems, which cannot integrate with West equipment, Politico reported, quoting experts.""Middle Eastern countries are very sensitive to the weakening US power in the region,"" Qui said, because  ""they have seen what Ukraine has experienced in the confrontation between NATO and Russia, so it would be very difficult for the US to use them to confront Iran and Russia in the regions.""  But it is possible for regional countries, especially Saudi Arabia, to use the US intention of forming a ""Middle East NATO"" to bargain for something else, including to totally get rid of the impact on US-Saudi Arabia ties caused by the death of journalist Jamal Khashoggi and also to loosen the US' ban on arms sales to Saudi Arabia, experts said. The US would also find dilemma in building a NATO-like alliance to counter Iran in the region and releasing more oil supplies from the region, analysts said.The US is facing an energy crisis now due to the Ukraine conflict and it wants Gulf states to increase supplies. However, France President Emmanuel Macron was told by the UAE that ""two top OPEC oil producers, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, can barely increase oil production,"" according to Reuters.This will make the US consider pushing negotiations with Iran on the nuclear deal to make Iran release more oil supplies, but this would offend Israel and Saudi Arabia, and goes against its own plan to build an anti-Iran regional alliance, said experts. Yin Gang, a research fellow at the Institute of West-Asia and Africa Studies of the China Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times on Wednesday, ""After taking office, Joe Biden rejoined the Iran nuclear deal, which had already upset the Gulf countries,"" and ironically, the energy crisis is making the US go cap in hand to OPEC members, mainly the Gulf countries.The US now hopes the OPEC members can release enough capacity, and the easing of relations with Iran will be an important part of the process, Yin said. ""If the Iran nuclear talks go well and Iran's oil export sanctions are lifted, Iran is expected to be able to release 1.5 million barrels of oil supply per day,"" Yin remarked.Cui said the dilemma for the US is whether to remove sanctions against Iran and let Tehran release more oil supplies but risk offending traditional allies like Israel and Saudi Arabia, or to build an anti-Iran alliance, but suffer from the pain of the energy crisis. ""There is no perfect plan for the US now,"" he said.  Russia President Vladimir Putin will also make his move soon to the Middle East to counter Joe Biden's latest actions. According to RT, Vladimir Putin will visit Tehran on July COVID-19 for talks with his Iran and Turkey counterparts, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said during a press briefing on Tuesday.Vladimir Putin will attend a trilateral meeting with Iran President Ebrahim Raisi and Turkey President Recep Tayyip Erdogan under the ""Astana peace process."" The format was launched in early 2017 with the aim of putting an end to the 11-year-long conflict in Syria. ""In addition to the trilateral meeting, there will also be bilateral meetings,"" Peskov said.The attitude of the Gulf countries and Russia's engagements with Iran will hang a question mark over Joe Biden's oil-hunting trip, observers noted.",CHINA,DIPLOMACY,"US President Joe Biden disembarks from his plane upon landing at Ben Gurion Airport in Lod near Tel Aviv, on July 13, 2022.

217,"IMF, other intl institutions urged to take responsibility in tackling Sri Lankan crisis to prevent more nations in Africa, LatAm to follow suits",GT staff reporters,2022-07-11,"As political leaders of Sri Lanka discussed the way forward for the country following the announced resignation of both the country's president and prime minister amid the worst economic crisis in decades in the country, China observers called on global financial organizations to coordinate creditors to speed up debt restructuring, avoid putting politics first and establish an emergency response mechanism to prevent more sovereign debt defaults as countries like Zimbabwe and Argentina may follow Sri Lanka into economic crisis. Sri Lanka's economy is highly dependent on foreign trade with limited resilience to shocks. The pandemic, the Russia-Ukraine conflict as well as US' unilateral sanctions against Russia have combined to precipitate a crisis, observers stressed. They said it was not directly related to China-funded infrastructure investment, and blaming China's projects is purely driven by malicious geopolitical motives. Sri Lankan President Gotabaya Rajapaksa officially informed Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe that he will continue with his resignation on Wednesday as previously announced, the Prime Minister's Office said Monday after protesters stormed the residences of the two leaders, Xinhua News Agency reported on Monday. A senior government official told Xinhua that Wickremesinghe called for an urgent meeting with his cabinet on Monday and will also meet leaders of all political parties  to discuss the way forward. Wickremesinghe has also agreed to resign. Wang Wenbin, spokesperson of China's Foreign Ministry, said at Monday's routine media briefing that China is closely following the latest developments in Sri Lanka. As a friendly neighbor and cooperation partner, we sincerely hope that all sectors in Sri Lanka could bear in mind the fundamental interests of their country and people and work together in solidarity to overcome the current difficulties and strive to restore stability, revitalize the economy and improve people's livelihoods at an early date,Wang said.China has provided emergency humanitarian assistance to Sri Lanka in the past months, and would continue to provide support and assistance to Sri Lanka within its capacity to help the country's economic recovery and ordinary people, but China observers said professional finance organizations, such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank, should be largely responsible for addressing the crisis based on effective coordination with all creditors, as commercial creditors and multilateral financial institutions are the major lenders behind Sri Lanka's foreign debt.  Meanwhile, although the US dominates the current global financial safety net, it conducts financial assistance more in its own interests than in the interests of the world. Some US-led small groups have constrained the effectiveness of global governance and the functioning of international organizations, which has exacerbated the Sri Lanka crisis, observes said. Some major powers, in pursuit of their own interests, have formed small groups based on the so-called common values, used global governance as a tool for geopolitical games, and downplayed the real value of global governance, Xu Liping, a research fellow on Southeast Asia studies at the China Academy of Social Sciences in Beijing, told the Global Times on Monday. For instance, the Quad, in the name of setting up a foreign aid group to jointly respond to the Sri Lanka crisis, actually has the true purpose of taking advantage of the crisis to exclude China and contain China's role in Sri Lanka, according to Xu.Xu suggested major countries and international organizations establish an emergency response mechanism to prevent more countries from facing a catastrophic debt crisis like Sri Lanka. He said Sri Lanka's crisis was mainly due to a foreign exchange shortage - a result of many external reasons including the impact of the coronavirus, the Russia-Ukraine conflict, and a single economic structure which makes it more fragile in the face of external shocks. Xu reiterated that the crisis was not directly related to China-funded infrastructure investment in Sri Lanka. Under the impact, all its pillar industries, such as tourism, textile and tea planting, are incapable of ""making money"" and thus leading to severe consequences, Xu said.Thus, the ongoing Sri Lanka crisis reflects a common challenge faced by many developing economies, especially those which have a single economic structure and are deeply affected by the Russia-Ukraine conflict, and other Asia countries like Nepal and Maldives should be on the alert, observers noted. They also warned that globally Africa countries like Zimbabwe and Latin US countries like Argentina and Brazil all at risk of following Sri Lanka into major economic crisis. While for Sri Lanka, external assistance can only provide temporary help, and the Asia nation must follow through on radical reforms if it wants to really get out of the crisis, Long Xingchun, president of the Chengdu Institute of World Affairs, told the Global Times on Monday. Sri Lanka's crisis reflects the mismatch between the country's development strategy and actual economic capacity, and between its long-term goals and the reality on the ground, according to Long. He said it is necessary for Sri Lanka to formulate a development strategy suitable for its national conditions based on its own situation rather than copying West modes. India media smear the BRI As a close neighbor of Sri Lanka, India has beefed up surveillance along the Sri Lankan maritime borders by deploying additional hovercrafts and patrol boats to prevent an influx of illegal immigrants, India Today reported on Sunday. Hu Zhiyong, a research fellow at the Institute of International Relations at the Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times on Monday that India may help Sri Lanka although the assistance may not be significant due to its own economic situation, as India needs to ensure that possible refugee issue of Sri Lanka would not result in security risks for India. But aside from protecting its own safety, some India media outlets have largely seen Sri Lankan crisis as a geopolitical tool to counter China's influence. The Times of India run an article entitled  ""How India hopes to counter China with 'unprecedented' support to crisis-hit Sri Lanka,"" and the Print, another India media, smeared the China-proposed Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) by claiming that more Asia countries, which borrowed from China for infrastructure projects,  ""face balance of payments challenges.""Qian Feng, director of the research department at the National Strategy Institute at Tsinghua University, told the Global Times on Monday that that the deteriorating China-India relations over the last two years have created more spaces for the India media to smear and attack China, and India media outlets have grabbed the opportunity of the current Sri Lanka crisis to try to influence India government decisions so that India may one day dominate South Asia. Meanwhile India often takes a strong hand on Sri Lankan issues with a long-standing condescending attitude, which can only cause negative response in Sri Lanka, analysts said. In comparison, the BRI projects such as Hambantota Port has developed into an important comprehensive port for the region, and it is China's loans and participation that have helped Sri Lanka revitalize its important assets, provided an key driving force for the sustainable development of Sri Lanka, analysts said.Maya Majueran, who's currently serving as a director of Belt&Road Initiative Sri Lanka (BRISL), a Sri Lanka-based organization that specializes in BRI cooperation, refuted the so-called debt-trap diplomacy hyped by some in the US and India media. ""Someone's hyping that Sri Lanka's debt burden was a result of BRI projects like Hambantota Port. However, there is no evidence supporting the claim. Furthermost China loans are concessional and taken for infrastructure and eco-social development,"" Majueran told the Global Times on Monday.In fact, in partnership with BRI, Sri Lanka commenced a series of developmental projects, leading to a huge overhaul of Sri Lankan infrastructure which had been lagging behind for generations. Improving infrastructure and creating jobs have immensely benefited the Sri Lankan people, Majueran said.However, political and economic turmoil in Sri Lanka will definitely have an impact on the progress of some large-scale BRI projects such as Hambantota Port and Colombo City, but the impact is short-term, Zhou Yuyuan, senior research fellow at the Center for West Asia and Africa Studies under the Shanghai Institutes for International Studies, told the Global Times on Monday.In the long run, these projects are actually important developments that were and will be critical in contributing to the economic construction of Sri Lanka. The Sri Lankan government is also fully aware of this and also attaches great importance to the BRI, Zhou said.",CHINA,DIPLOMACY,"Protesters gather near the presidential palace in Colombo, Sri Lanka on July 9, 2022.

218,Japan will open a box that brings endless trouble if it amends constitution: Global Times editorial,Global Times,2022-07-12,"As the result of Japan's upper house election showed on Monday, Japan's governing party led by Prime Minister Fumio Kishida and its coalition partner scored a major victory. The forces that advocate constitutional amendments obtained more than two thirds of the seats, passing the threshold required for starting the process of constitutional amendments. At a press conference on Monday, Kishida said that he will facilitate parliamentary debate as soon as possible over four constitutional amendments proposed by the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) including writing the Self-Defense Forces into article 9 of the constitution. Many analysts believe the obstacles for Japan to change its pacifist Constitution have been basically cleared, and the possibility for constitutional amendments is more likely than ever before.The current constitution of Japan was implemented in 1947, and its ninth article clearly stipulates that ""land, sea, and air forces, as well as other war potential, will never be sustained"" and ""the right of belligerency of the state will not be recognized."" Hence the name ""pacifist Constitution."" This was not only a prerequisite for Japan's return to the international community after the war, but also one of the cornerstones for lasting peace in East Asia. Although Japan implemented a new security law in 2016 to lift the ban on the ""right of collective self-defense"" and break the restrictions on sending troops overseas which had been in place since 1945, which has largely already overridden the country's pacifist Constitution, whether to make the official move of constitutional amendments is still a very important weather vane.Because of this, the motion of constitutional amendments is still facing fierce controversy not only in Japan, but has also caused wide-ranging concern throughout Asia-Pacific neighbors and the international community, including many clear-cut voices of opposition. Under such circumstances, if Self-Defense Forces are included in Article 9 of the pacifist Constitution, Japan will send a dangerous signal to its neighbors and across Asia to deny the postwar history and the path of peaceful development. In this sense, whether or not to amend Article 9 of the pacifist Constitution is by no means entirely a case of ""Japan's internal affairs."" Victims of Japan militarism have reasons and the necessity to express concerns and question Japan's constitutional amendments.Japan still hasn't made a profound apology to its Asia neighbors on historical issues nor reflected on it. Instead, the Japan right wing forces have been seeking to completely untie its military power, which is an important reason for Japan's constant lack of trust and disagreement with its neighbors. Although the right wing forces have regarded the country's pacifist Constitution as a thorn in their side that must be removed sooner or later, peace-loving public opinion in Japan has been suppressing these forces like a massive mountain for the past decades. Now Abe's assassination is likely to help the LDP gain more sympathy, accelerate their stalled agenda, and help turn back the wheel of history further.Kishida mentioned on Monday that Japan is now facing one of the most difficult times in the post-war period. What he said is true. Issues, such as the sluggish economy, soaring prices, and uncontrolled COVID-19 epidemic, have made the life of the Japan people difficult. But no tool can be pulled out from the box of the ""constitutional amendments"" to address these urgent problems. Instead, it is likely to unleash forces of monster that bite. The pacifist Constitution restrains Japan's militaristic impulse, and it has never stifled the energy of the nation's peaceful development - It greatly ensures the development. It is totally unnecessary for the Japan right wing to amplify the sense of insecurity deliberately.Over the last decade or so, Japan's right-wing politicians have been using crises to declare that the pacifist Constitution has become out of date and flagging the need to find ""alternative ways"" to make it a mere scrap of paper. Previously, there was a forcible push for a new security law. Now, there is the introduction of NATO into the Asia-Pacific and the use of the Russia-Ukraine conflict to make a big deal over the Taiwan question. It is certain that if Japan spends a tremendous amount of money to expand its military power, and even upgrade the Self-Defense Forces to be an army and regain the right to launch a war, the result will be that Japan will move from its safe position to a dangerous or even desperate situation and the entire East Asia region will be dragged into a new round of crisis.On this issue, the role of the US must be mentioned. Japan today still cares about US's opinion the most. Without US' permission, Japan would not be bold enough to amend its constitution. The US, on one hand, wants to indulge Japan to play the role as a geopolitical thug, and on the other hand, is also on guard against Japan's right-lean tendency which may result to it getting rid of US's control. US's two-pronged consideration has influenced the pace of constitutional amendments of Japan. Right now, apparently the US is eager to push Japan to the forefront of confronting China in Asia, so it does LDP a favor on the issue. But we have to say that Pearl Harbor attack still exists in living memory. Now Tokyo is no longer shy about its desire to amend its constitution. It is fully interested in playing a military role, even a little being carried away under encouragement of the US. But peace-loving forces inside and outside Japan can never sit idle. They should do utmost to prevent Tokyo from opening the magic box of constitutional amendments. The Japan government should realize that the end of militarism is abyss. History has proved it once. It doesn't need to be proved twice.",OPINION,EDITORIAL,"Japan's Prime Minister and President of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) Fumio Kishida (center L) places a red paper rose on an LDP candidate's name to indicate the victory in the upper house election, along with his party executives at the party's headquarters in Tokyo on July 10, 2022.",Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'Japan': ('LOC', 13), 'East Asia': ('LOC', 4), 'Pacific': ('LOC', 1), 'Fumio Kishida': ('PER', 2), 'Liberal Democratic Party': ('ORG', 1), 'LDP': ('ORG', 1), 'Self - Defense Forces': ('ORG', 2), 'Constitution': ('MISC', 3), 'Article 9': ('MISC', 1)}"

221,UN deputy relief chief warns of worsening of Yemen's humanitarian catastrophe,Xinhua,2022-07-12," 

People wait for free food at a charity on the first day of Ramadan in Sanaa, Yemen, on April 2, 2022.(Photo: Xinhua) The UN deputy relief chief on Monday called for quick and decisive international action as Yemen's humanitarian catastrophe is expected to worsen.""Yemen's humanitarian catastrophe is about to get much worse,"" said Joyce Msuya, UN assistant secretary-general for humanitarian affairs and deputy emergency relief coordinator.The temporary truce represents a landmark step forward, she said. ""But the truce alone will not be enough to stop what we fear is coming. Humanitarian needs across the country, including the risk of famine in some areas, could rise sharply in the coming weeks and months. The international community must act quickly and decisively to stop this.""The need to protect Yemen's economy from domestic challenges and from the impact of the conflict in Ukraine remains urgent, she said.The exchange rate, which is a key factor in how much food people can afford to eat, is still collapsing. The Yemeni rial is now trading at about 1,120 to the U.S. dollar in Aden. Most of the currency's gains since the truce began have now been wiped out. That means many more families are going hungry again, she said.The Ukraine conflict is also threatening the supply chains that bring in Yemen's food, nearly 90 percent of which must be imported. Last year, just under half of all wheat came from Russia and Ukraine. When those supplies were cut off in February, Yemeni importers moved quickly to find other sources. But rising global prices, diminished access to capital and other challenges are making it much harder for importers to keep those supply chains working, said Msuya.UN relief work is severely threatened by funding shorfalls, she said.The UN response plan for Yemen has so far received just over 1.1 billion dollars, or 27 percent of what it needs. This is the sharpest year-on-year decrease of any UN-coordinated plan in the world, she said.""We know budgets are tight, and we deeply appreciate everyone's contributions. But we also have a responsibility to say clearly: aid agencies are dangerously under-resourced for what we fear is coming. Hunger is worse than ever, and yet the World Food Programme was forced to cut rations for millions of people several weeks ago due to funding gaps. That was the second major food cut in just six months,"" she said.Beyond the response plan, funds for other urgent priorities are also lacking. The UN plan to resolve the threat from the SAFER oil tanker, for example, is still struggling to fill an immediate shortfall of 20 million dollars. The UN Verification and Inspection Mechanism, created in 2016 to facilitate commercial imports to Yemen, is also running out of money. Without additional funding, it will have to shut down in September, she said.Aid work is becoming more difficult and more dangerous. Intimidation and incitement against aid agencies have continued across Yemen. This is being fuelled by misinformation amplified through social media, messaging apps and in some public forums, said Msuya.The truce offers a rare opportunity to end the crisis in Yemen for good. Efforts to address and ultimately reduce humanitarian needs should be part and parcel of seizing this opportunity, she said.",PHOTO,WORLD,"Children help their family harvest sorghum in the Midi district of Hajjah province, northern Yemen, on June 19, 2022.(Photo: Xinhua)",Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'Ramadan': ('MISC', 1), 'Yemeni': ('MISC', 2), 'Sanaa': ('LOC', 1), 'Yemen': ('LOC', 6), 'Ukraine': ('LOC', 3), 'U': ('LOC', 1), 'S': ('LOC', 1), 'Aden': ('LOC', 1), 'Russia': ('LOC', 1), 'Xinhua': ('ORG', 1), 'UN': ('ORG', 5), 'Joyce Msuya': ('PER', 2)}"
222,Rearmament trend sounds alarm to global security,Guo Xiaobing,2022-07-12,"A US military test rocket, the Minotaur II+, which will be used for the LGM-35 Sentinel intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) and its nuclear warhead, the Mk21A, exploded about 11 seconds after launch earlier this month. The debut ended in failure, but it shows that the US is accelerating the replacement of its land-based ICBMs and nuclear weapon delivery vehicles. A report published in June by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute noted, ""A key finding is that despite a marginal decrease in the number of nuclear warheads in 2021, nuclear arsenals are expected to grow over the coming decade,"" and the ""post-cold war decline in nuclear arsenals is ending."" This will be an important turning point in the process of global nuclear disarmament and nuclear weapons are set to stage a comeback from the fringes of global politics. There are three main reasons for the rearmament trend.To begin with, the prospects for US and Russia nuclear disarmament are gloomy. If we are talking about a major cut in the global nuclear arsenal, the key is whether the US and Russia will make the determination to cut theirs. After years of disarmament, the US and Russia, together, still possess more than 90 percent of the world's nuclear weapons. There were some positive signs, including the Joint Statement of the Leaders of the Five Nuclear-Weapon States on Preventing Nuclear War and Avoiding Arms Races, issued in January, which said that ""a nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought."" However, since the outbreak of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, ties between Russia and the US are now frozen. It is increasingly harder for the two countries to keep discussing nuclear disarmament. In April, Foreign Policy published an article with a pessimistic tone, ""How to Avoid the Dark Ages of Arms Control."" Second, global strategic stability has been eroded and undermined, triggering a chain reaction of nuclear development. In terms of the ending of post-cold war decline in nuclear arsenals, the US is the biggest driving force. It already has a huge nuclear arsenal and advanced conventional weapons, but US is not satisfied. It is continuing to develop missile defense systems while upgrading its nuclear arsenal.The US alone spent $44.2 billion on its nuclear arsenal in 2021, up 12.7 percent from a year earlier constituting half of global nuclear expenditures. Against the backdrop, which of the countries the US considers ""major competitors"" or ""potential adversaries"" would be willing to sit back and let the viability and defense penetration ability of their strategic forces be weakened, while placing the security of their people in times of crisis on the imaginary goodwill and self-restraint of the US?  History proves that US goodwill is never reliable when it has the advantage of a ""dimensionality reduction strike,"" or absolute advantage in battlefields. It was the US that pushed the first domino in global strategic stability, triggering a series of domino effects throughout Eurasia. Curbing the trend of an increase in nuclear warhead numbers requires safeguarding the fundamental goal of maintaining global strategic stability, with the US taking the lead in adopting positive measures to limit or even eliminate its missile defense program, banning the weaponization of space, and recognizing and respecting the nuclear deterrence capabilities of other nuclear-weapon states (NWS). Third, the back door to nuclear proliferation is opening wider in more diverse forms, one of which is the proliferation of nuclear submarines. The US, the UK, and Australia previously reached an agreement to help Australia develop nuclear submarines fueled with weapons-grade uranium enriched to more than 90 percent uranium-235, which sets a bad precedent for other countries to follow suit. Another form is geographic nuclear proliferation through ""nuclear sharing."" Some Japan politicians have previously considered introducing US nuclear weapons into Japan.The resurgence in the number of nuclear weapons is a key indicator. However, the scale of nuclear weapons is not everything in terms of this issue. What's more important is how major powers prevent and manage conflict while guarding against nuclear escalation. How to avoid one of the most important inventions of humankind from turning common glory into ashes is a question that all countries, especially the NWS, need to seriously consider.The author is director of Arms Control Studies Center, China Institutes of Contemporary International Relations. opinion@globaltimes.com.cn",OPINION,VIEWPOINT,Illustration: Liu Rui/Global Times,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'US': ('LOC', 8), 'USC': ('LOC', 1), 'Russia': ('LOC', 5), 'Ukraine': ('LOC', 1), 'Minotaur II +': ('MISC', 1), 'LGM - 35 SentinelC': ('MISC', 1), 'Mk21A': ('MISC', 1), 'Joint': ('MISC', 1), 'Five Nuclear': ('MISC', 1), 'Weapon States': ('MISC', 1), 'Stockholm International Peace Research Institute': ('ORG', 1), 'Foreign Policy': ('ORG', 1)}"
223,Global governance deficits resulting from US hegemony one of causes of Sri Lanka’s crisis,Bi Xing,2022-07-12,"A US Post article on Monday discussed how Sri Lanka landed in a political and economic crisis, pointing fingers at China, saying that with foreign-exchange earnings plunging, the country struggles to manage its external debt, which had grown in part due to ""loans from China to fund ambitious infrastructure projects."" With the domestic crisis worsening in Sri Lanka, there have been voices in the US calling for assistance to Sri Lanka, especially under the Quad framework. On June 10, in a letter to Quad foreign ministers, US Senate Foreign Relations Committee chairman Robert Menendez urged these countries to proactively help Sri Lanka to demonstrate Quad's capabilities in the Indo-Pacific region. A US Post editorial last week argued a debt crisis in Sri Lanka ""presents an opportunity for the Joe Biden administration to fashion a rescue in conjunction with other members of the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue.""For a long time, the US had a limited interest and role in helping resolve the economic difficulties of developing countries and rarely took initiatives to make such a call. Yang Xiyu, a senior research fellow at the China Institute of International Studies, said that the US' acts this time is not for humanitarian purposes or stabilizing Sri Lanka's economy, but for geostrategic considerations.Sri Lanka occupies a very critical geographical position in the Asia-Pacific. By offering to provide so-called aid to the economic crisis in Sri Lanka, the US' most important purpose is to strengthen its presence and influence in such important geographical location. The US' consideration goes far beyond an economic scope, rather US aid and economic relief to other countries always has additional conditions based on its own interests, which makes its foreign aid projects lean towards US interests and deviate from that of the recipient countries. Thus, such programs will play an extremely limited role.US public opinion has long hyped the claim that China's global investment and lending program, including the Hambantota Port Development Project, ""amounts to a debt trap for vulnerable countries around the world."" Menendez also blamed Sri Lanka's crisis on China's ""debt trap."" ""In fact, among Sri Lanka's external debts, many different statistics show that China is not the largest creditor. It is not China that is forcing the construction of the Hambantota port, but Sri Lanka has actively invited China to help build it for the sake of its domestic economy,"" said Zhang Jie, a researcher from the National Institute of International Strategy under the China Academy of Social Sciences. Sri Lanka's economic crisis is caused by a series of domestic and international factors and mistakes in government decisions. In fact, a series of moves guided by the hegemonic mindset of the US have contributed to the bankruptcy of small countries like Sri Lanka. Xu Liping, a research fellow on Southeast Asia studies at the China Academy of Social Sciences in Beijing, noted that the ""deficit"" in global governance has led to various crises in Sri Lanka that have overlapped and culminated into political crises.Marked by the Russia-Ukraine conflict, traditional security threats have returned to the center of international vision, further widening the peace deficit, exacerbating trust deficits between major powers, and fundamentally shaking the foundation of global governance. In addition, non-traditional security matters such as terrorism, climate change, financial crisis, energy crisis, food crisis, and large-scale infectious diseases are increasingly rampant, bringing unprecedented challenges to global governance. Furthermore, hegemonic inertia has solidified the global governance deficit by distorting the just international political and economic order, causing the absence of many developing countries in global governance, Xu argued. The US, as a hegemonic state, has used its financial hegemony to continuously raise interest rates on the US dollar in its own interest. As a result, dollar-denominated debt, owed by developing countries, increases. The US-led intra-regional blocs are also a constraint on the effectiveness of global governance. US attempts to assist Sri Lanka through the Quad are likely to fail given a lack of funds, just as are many other US-led regional economic initiatives, which are little more than lip service in practice, but may also have a more negative impact on regional security through its involvement in regional affairs. According to Yang, the US' recent intentions on the Sri Lanka issue show its tendency to further intervene in regional affairs. It's an attempt to turn the Quad into a mechanism to govern regional affairs.The author is a reporter with the Global Times. opinion@globaltimes.com.cn",OPINION,VIEWPOINT,"Protesters gather near the presidential palace in Colombo, Sri Lanka on July 9, 2022.

224,"China’s economy shows resilience in face of global troubles, nation still leads recovery",GT staff reporters,2022-07-11,"Yantian Port in Shenzhen, China's Guangdong Province Photo: VCGIn a complex global environment marked by profound disruptions to global trade and trade protectionism, many countries, including West developed countries, have seen serious economic troubles, with Germany, known as the ""EU economic locomotive,"" for example, has been dragged into a trade deficit for the first time in 30 years. In comparison, China's trade surplus in May was $78.76 billion, with a trade surplus near $300 billion in the first five months of this year. Analysts said the contrast not only reflects China's economic resilience, but also shows the ""complete failure"" of the US' attempt to disrupt the global trade system. France Customs said that the trade deficit for France goods reached a new record in May, at 13.1 billion euros ($13.34 billion), due to the deterioration of the country's energy balance. Japan ran its biggest single-month trade deficit in more than eight years in May as high commodity prices and a declining yen swelled imports, clouding the country's economic outlook, according to Reuters. The growing trade deficit underscores the headwinds the world's third-largest economy faces from a slide in the yen and surging costs of fuel and raw materials, on which domestic manufacturers rely for production, Reuters said. Germany, EU's biggest economy, reported its first monthly trade deficit in three decades, as its shortfall in May was 1 billion euros, a gap not seen since 1991. Experts cited mixed reasons behind the widening trade deficit in many economies, including the Ukraine crisis which added woes to an already battered global supply chain, as well as the economic trauma in many developed economies in recent years. Many countries apart from China have taken a severe blow in their supply and industrial chains and have not entirely recovered from these blows, Bai Ming, deputy director of the international market research institute at the China Academy of International Trade and Economic Cooperation,told the Global Times, adding that this caused many countries to encounter difficulties in producing or shipping their products abroad, which eats into their share of exports. In particular, observers stressed that the Ukraine crisis has played a part in accelerating the trade deficit. For countries like Germany or other EU countries who depend a lot of Russia bulk commodities, the Ukraine crisis, which led to a decrease in energy trade between Moscowand many EU countries, the cost of bulk commodity imports has risen considerably. Mei Xinyu, a research fellow at the China Academy of International Trade and Economic Cooperation of China's Ministry of Commerce, also told the Global Times that West sanctions toward Russia on the Ukraine crisis would ""backfire"" on the EU by causing its exports channels to be restricted, while increasing the costs of its raw materials and logistics, further slashing the competence of its industries. ""After the Ukraine conflict, many of the EU's traditional competitive industries like cars and chemicals will likely fall in global markets,"" said Mei. However, looking deeper into the trade deficit phenomenon, observers said that they reflected more intrinsic economic problems faced by those countries. For instance, Chen Jia, a research fellow at the International Monetary Institute of the Renmin University of China, told the Global Times on Sunday that Japan's trade fluctuation could be seen as a symptom of the countries' economic weakening in a post-pandemic environment, with problems like high inflation, currency depreciation and so forth. Likewise, the EU's dependence on cheap fossil energy in the past decades have not only caused its economy to recede under global volatility, but has prompted it to lag largely behind China and the US in pushing new tech reforms, like the application of new energy, Chen said. China's trade grew 11.1 percent year-on-year in May, posting a trade surplus of $78.76 billion, expanding 82.3 percent year-on-year, despite of mounting headwinds of rising international commodity prices and declining overseas demand amid high inflation. According to experts, the contrast between China and many US' allies' trade situation not only reflects China's superiority in terms of economic resilience, but also shows the ""complete failure"" of the US' strategy to reform global trade system, especially with a focus on cracking down upon China to support other regions. ""China's role as trade powerhouse and global factory is being strengthened, while many of its competitors are heavily impacted by a turbulent global landscape, with some showing signs of economic recession,"" Chen said. But Bai cautioned that the economic weakness of EU countries might add pressure to China's trade as well, as EU and the US customers are major purchasers of China goods. ""China's trade pressure has gradually eased in the first half of this year, and performance in the second half hinges on factors like competition from Southeast Asia economies and the demands from EU or US markets,"" Bai said, but adding that if coronavirus situation is under control, then a stable trade situation still can be expected. Mei also noted the widening trade deficit in overseas countries would strengthen China's role as the world's factory. But if China's exports prices surges too much, it will also give opportunities to other countries to catch up with China's export advantages.",SOURCE,ECONOMY,Author details not found,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'Yantian Port': ('LOC', 1), 'Shenzhen': ('LOC', 1), 'China': ('LOC', 5), 'Guangdong Province': ('LOC', 1), 'Germany': ('LOC', 3), 'US': ('LOC', 1), 'France': ('LOC', 2), 'Japan': ('LOC', 1), 'Ukraine': ('LOC', 3), 'Russia': ('LOC', 1), 'Moscow': ('LOC', 1), 'VC': ('ORG', 1), 'EU': ('ORG', 4), 'Customs': ('ORG', 1), 'Reuters': ('ORG', 2), 'West': ('MISC', 1)}"
225,"US, West should not have twisted excitement toward Sri Lanka crisis: Global Times editorial",Global Times,2022-07-11,"On Saturday, tens of thousands of protesters broke into the presidential residence in Sri Lanka's capital Colombo. President Gotabaya Rajapaksa announced that he would resign on July 13 after being chased from the residence. Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said he will leave office once a multi-party government is in place. There remains a question mark over to what extent the regime change can resolve the economic and social crisis that has plagued this Asia country for more than half a year.This Asia island nation of 22 million people is facing record inflation and shortages of fuel, food and medicine, and people's livelihood is in great difficulty. The Sri Lankan government had previously declared bankruptcy, becoming the first country to default on its foreign debt this century. In addition to the situation in Sri Lanka, there is another question that people are concerned about: Will there be another bankrupt country and who will it be?In just a few years, Sri Lanka has grown from a middle-to-high-income country in South Asia to where it is today, which is undoubtedly the result of a combination of internal and external factors. The two major external factors are COVID-19 pandemic which has hit the tourism industry hard, the pillar of Sri Lanka's economy and the second is the rise in energy and food prices caused by the conflict between Russia and Ukraine. From the perspective of internal factors, the relatively radical agricultural and economic policies launched by Sri Lanka in previous years makes the country difficult to resist the impact of external factors.It can be seen that a country like Sri Lanka whose economy relies heavily on foreign exchange income is fragile in its ability to resist global economic risks, and the bankruptcy is caused by multiple factors. It has to be said that some countries in the West like the US are more interested in using the Sri Lanka crisis for geopolitical manipulation than they are willing to offer real assistance to the country. They look at Sri Lanka which is in crisis not with anxiety, but with twisted excitement.Sri Lanka is already scarred and cannot bear the pressure and cost of becoming a geopolitical arena. Many research reports have repeatedly demonstrated that Sri Lanka's current debt crisis is not directly related to China-funded infrastructure investment. Bilateral foreign debt to China only accounts for 10 percent of Sri Lanka's total outstanding foreign debt. West countries' commercial creditors and multilateral financial institutions are responsible for Sri Lanka's foreign debt. They sold the debt to so-called vulture funds, which really exploited Sri Lanka's every penny. Therefore, discrediting China by accusing it of digging of the ""debt trap"" and even attacking the Belt and Road Initiative is not grounded. Given Sri Lanka's experience, it is urgent to break the development dilemma of some developing countries. Just imagine it. If Sri Lanka gradually forms its own economic development system, it will be more able to resist risks when encountered with a harsh external economic environment. In fact, this has become the consensus of an increasing number of countries. As of the end of May 2022, China has signed more than 200 ""Belt and Road"" cooperation documents with 150 countries and 32 international organizations, and the circle of friends for the construction of the Belt and Road Initiative has been expanding, which strongly proves that cooperation is moving in the right direction.US is well aware of this. The Donald Trump administration's proposal of the ""Blue Dot Network,"" claiming to promote the construction of high-quality regional infrastructure, the Joe Biden administration's proposal to ""Build Back Better World"" in June 2021, and Joe Biden' announcement this June during the G7 Summit that the bloc will mobilize about $600 billion for global infrastructure investment can all prove it. Strengthening infrastructure and enhancing endogenous power is the real key to cracking the development dilemma. However, just because the Belt and Road Initiative underlines cooperation and joint construction rather than the leadership of the US and the West, some people in the US and the West have spared no effort to smear and undermine it.As the global economy enters a time of crisis, the word ""development"" highlights a value even more precious than gold. The ""national bankruptcy"" crisis facing Sri Lanka is essentially triggered by global development and governance deficits. The regional security crisis exacerbated by the US and the West has deepened the global development crisis. We sincerely hope that the US and some countries in the West can restrain their geopolitical impulses to indulge in great power competition. They should give some space to their consciences, and give some time to development.",OPINION,EDITORIAL,"Protesters gather near the presidential palace in Colombo, Sri Lanka on July 9, 2022.

226,Liz Truss as PM will be disastrous for Britain,James Smith,2022-07-11,"It has been an open secret for a long time that UK Foreign Secretary Elizabeth Truss has had aspirations to become the leader of the Conservative Party and Prime Minister of the UK. So, when Boris Johnson announced his pending resignation following a series of surmounting scandals, it was little surprise to the media and public at large that Liz threw her name in the hat. As foreign secretary, Elizabeth Truss has made herself known through an appeal to extreme nationalism, overboard ideological chauvinism and unnecessary hawkishness. Not only has she nailed her mast to the post of ""Vladimir Putin must lose"" in Ukraine, but she has also called for publicly intervening in the Taiwan question, expansion of NATO into Asia, peddled Cold War concepts such as ""a network of liberty"" and invoked confrontation with China at every opportunity. Commentators have often ridiculed her as being a poorer version of Margaret Thatcher, seeking to invoke the same sentiments but of course less convincingly. Former Australia Prime Minister Paul Keating famously described her as ""demented"". Yet, there is also a glaring element of opportunism evident within her extreme rhetoric, given prior to Brexit she in fact supported the UK remaining in the EU. Elizabeth Truss has clearly mastered an art of ""failing upwards"" in advancing her career through an appeal to overboard populist sentiment, and was selected by an equally opportunistic and chaotic Boris Johnson government not of course for her competence and skill-set, but through the sheer fact she said the things people wanted to hear, having made her name as minister for state by grotesquely exaggerating UK's post-Brexit trade gains, and successfully glossing over the country's grim economic outlook.It goes without saying that a Elizabeth Truss leadership would constitute nothing less than a colossal disaster for the UK, and there is absolutely nothing beyond her unhinged rhetoric which would suggest she is even remotely qualified for the role of Prime Minister. In such a scenario, Elizabeth Truss' absurd and antique neo-imperialism would leave the UK isolated, ridiculed and widely despised. Her rhetoric constantly drums upon memories of a great power nostalgia, making little secret of her simplistic view of world affairs as a zero-sum ideological confrontation, and a belief the UK and its allies have a right to ""dominate"" the rest of the world in the name of ""democracy"", ""liberty"" and ""free markets"", the very sentiment which the UK Empire used to conquer and oppress others.But what is more disturbing is that none of these chauvinistic and zealous outbursts have any basis in reality whatsoever. UK is not a reascending power, it is a declining one, and Brexit has only served to sharpen that decline as opposed to reversing it, far from the ""Global UK"" Elizabeth Truss professes to promote. As a headline in the Financial Times reads, ""The UK economy is stagnant - and the reasons run deep."" The annual rate of inflation in May stood at 9.1 percent, the highest in G7, Gross Domestic Product has been in contraction since March, and the country is being marred by growing industrial unrest as the cost of living outstrips wage growth. All of this has only been exacerbated further by London's bid to make itself the primary cheerleader of escalating the war in Ukraine against Moscow. But even if one discards the impact of the conflict, the economic picture is still grim given the self-imposed political consequences of Brexit.Given this, what state is the UK truly in to then confront China? An almost inevitable consequence if Elizabeth Truss should succeed. The only redeeming feature of the Boris Johnson government was that he was personally moderate on Beijing, and before the US twisted his arm, understood the importance of maintaining close trade and investment ties with China. Yet if Elizabeth Truss attains power, one should expect all reason, moderation, pragmatism and common sense will be thrown out of the window by her unrestrained and unfathomable quench for Cold War confrontation. For the UK economy and for the UK people, such a scenario will have disastrous consequences which will include further economic stagnation, even deeper inflation and even nastier supply chain related shocks. Elizabeth Truss is a disaster waiting to happen. As Foreign Secretary, her entire policy is premised on the pipe dream of great power nostalgia. She has little conception of what diplomacy and realpolitik really means, but believes that chest thumping rhetoric and ideological soundbites constitutes a strategy, it does not. UK can only thrive once it discards this silly great power nostalgia and adopts a realistic view of its place and prospects in the world. Elizabeth Truss won't lead UK to glory, hegemony and might again, but to global embarrassment and humiliation. The author is a political and historical relations analyst. opinion@globaltimes.com.cn.",OPINION,VIEWPOINT,Liz Truss  Photo: AFP,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'UK': ('LOC', 7), 'Ukraine': ('LOC', 1), 'Taiwan': ('LOC', 1), 'Asia': ('LOC', 1), 'China': ('LOC', 1), 'Australia': ('LOC', 1), 'Elizabeth Truss': ('PER', 5), 'Boris Johnson': ('PER', 2), 'Liz': ('PER', 1), 'Vladimir Putin': ('PER', 1), 'Margaret Thatcher': ('PER', 1), 'Paul Keating': ('PER', 1), 'Conservative Party': ('ORG', 1), 'NATO': ('ORG', 1), 'EU': ('ORG', 1), 'Cold War': ('MISC', 1), 'Brexit': ('MISC', 2)}"
227,NATO remains a cautious option for India,Lan Jianxue and Lin Duo,2022-07-11,"The NATO summit, recently concluded in Madrid, Spain, released the bloc's new Strategic Concept, pointing a finger at Russia and defining China as a ""systemic challenge."" NATO also invited non-NATO members in the Asia-Pacific region to attend the summit, including Japan, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand. It made a high-profile announcement to increase its involvement in Asia-Pacific affairs and introduced a series of military policies. After the summit, some India media outlets have been discussing that as NATO's anti-China tirade grows, will India join in? There have been relevant analyses since last year. In an article entitled, ""NATO: India's next geopolitical destination,"" published in March 2021, Hindustan Times said that ""Indians should be under no illusions that a truly non-aligned path remains a viable option.""As a matter of fact, as a key part of the US' Indo-Pacific Strategy to contain China, India is somehow dissatisfied that it has been left outside the NATO summit. India believes it is a deliberate act by US and EU countries, as well as a US' punishment for India being not firm enough in opposing Russia and China, and not clear in its pro-US stance.Since India Prime Minister Narendra Modi came into power in 2014, India has substantially adjusted its non-alignment policy and adopted a series of pro-US policies. India has accelerated its pace of moving toward the US in terms of the Quad mechanism, trade, investment and other aspects. Over the past 10 years, the US and India have signed multiple security agreements and India has become a quasi-military ally of the US. But the US has not really viewed India as a close partner, and always feels that India is not obedient enough. Therefore, in addition to the Quad, the Joe Biden administration has created an Anglo-Saxon AUKUS. The US' strategic doubts about India are much too obvious. After the outbreak of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, the US and its allies took turns to pressure India, trying to make India take a tougher stance on Russia. The US and its NATO allies did not invite India to the NATO summit, which is mainly due to US's dissatisfaction that India refused to condemn and sanction Russia on the Ukraine issue.On the other hand, the India strategic circle is cautious about the cooperation between India and NATO, but does not rule out the possibility of limited cooperation. India public opinion advocates that with the acceleration of NATO's push into the Asia-Pacific, India should not rule out the possibility of dialogues and issue-based limited cooperation with NATO.Currently, India lacks realistic conditions and motivation to join NATO, but it may conduct opportunistic cooperation with NATO when necessary. India's public opinion is divided on the nature of NATO. Some India experts claim that India and NATO can explore joint cooperation positions through regular dialogue mechanisms, exchange views on issues including counter-terrorism and geopolitical situation. Some also say that India can jointly build an Indo-Pacific maritime security alliance with NATO. The level and extent of India's cooperation with NATO depends on how India's foreign policy evolves and how India assesses its strategic autonomy. In the foreseeable future, India will have limited cooperation with NATO. India's attitude toward Russia and its China policy will make India think twice before enhancing cooperation with NATO. Besides, NATO has launched or been involved in a series of regional conflicts and wars since its establishment. It has failed to manage its relations with Russia and hyped up wars in EU. India also has long-standing strategic suspicion toward the US. These factors also greatly restrain India's cooperation with NATO. India's mainstream view on its diplomatic strategy will still be seeking to benefit from cooperation with both the East and the West, and realizing its dream of a major power within the framework of strategic independence. It is unwilling to be a junior partner of the US and the West, or pulling the chestnuts out of the fire for the US at the price of a deterioration in its own strategic environment. Lan Jianxue is director of the Department for Asia-Pacific Studies at the China Institute of International Studies (CIIS).

228,"UK loses global influence with declining national strength, shaky internal politics",Yang Sheng,2022-07-11,"After UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced his resignation, the country could enter a stage without a long-term prime minister, as the country has failed to find a way to keep its national strength from declining after Brexit and there is no politician who can effectively fix the country's internal divergences, while trying to use the Ukraine crisis as an opportunity to maintain UK influence has proved unhelpful for London to solve its internal problems, analysts said on Monday, as a number of politicians jostle to replace Boris Johnson in a packed race.According to Reuters, the contest to replace Boris Johnson gathered pace on Sunday as five more candidates declared their intention to run, with many pledging lower taxes and a clean start from ""Boris Johnson's scandal-ridden premiership.""Conservative MPs are beginning to put their names forward in the race to succeed Boris Johnson as Conservative leader and prime minister, BBC reported. A timetable for the Tory leadership race is due to be confirmed next week and the new prime minister is expected to be in position by September.Wang Yiwei, director of the Institute of International Affairs at Renmin University of China, told the Global Times on Monday that the UK is no longer as appealing or influential as it used to be, ""with the queen getting older and older, and with questions over the extent that the royal family has a role in presenting the glory of the UK, and due to its declining national strength after Brexit, the governments led by Theresa May (2016-COVID-19) and Boris Johnson both acted like transitional governments to handle the impacts of Brexit.""Cui Hongjian, director of the Department of EU Studies at the China Institute of International Studies, told the Global Times on Monday that the frequent changes  of government have shown that Brexit will continue to impact the country in the long term and is still impacting the country, as the Conservative Party is also without a consensus on the Brexit issue.""How to normalize the governance of the UK and let the country recover from Brexit is still the prominent challenge that the entire UK political circle needs to solve,"" Cui noted. China analysts also said that after the Russia-Ukraine crisis, it seems that the UK is trying to seek more influence by actively getting involved in the crisis in the continent of EU, and also trying to become involved in security issues in Asia to make up for the international influence that it has lost after Brexit. In the latest UK move, UK forces have begun training Ukraine soldiers in a new program to help in their fight against Russia. Up to 10,000 Ukraine soldiers will arrive in the UK for specialist military training lasting several weeks. The first cohort met UK defense secretary Ben Wallace on Thursday, the UK Ministry of Defense confirmed, the Guardian reported.Some military experts said it's questionable to what extent a few weeks of training could help Ukraine overcome the military advantage held by Russia. Furthermore, considering the experience of the US when training foreigners to fight regimes that the US wanted to overthrew in other countries, these Ukraine soldiers might prefer to stay in the UK as immigrants rather than return to Ukraine. Many UK policies involving overseas issues just lead to more problems, such as increasing pressure in receiving refugees and immigrants, rather than finding more opportunities to boost its economy, said analysts. They noted that this just makes the UK the weakest major power among the five permanent members of the UN, and its diplomacy of closely following the US also means it has fewer alternatives in dealing with other major powers. This deep-rooted problem is actually caused by the West's political system, as it has already resulted in phenomena like Brexit and the rise of Trumpism. This means it is unable to balance the system run by the elites and the governance of the  grass roots through increasing populism, Cui said. He pointed out that the problem now is many in the West still believe that the biggest ""threat"" to their democracy is the political systems of other non-West powers, especially China, as they believe China's system is making the West system appear less attractive. Future of the UKBritish media is now focusing on who will become Boris Johnson's successor to clean up the mess and bring the country back on track. Rishi Sunak, former chancellor of the exchequer (finance minister), is now the favorite, according to betting odds. He leads the field, followed by Minister of State for Trade Policy Penny Mordaunt and Foreign Secretary Elizabeth Truss, BBC reported.According to the Financial Times on July 1, 2021, when Sunak was the finance minister, he used his annual Mansion House speech to insist that UK beef up its trading relationship with China, while admitting that efforts to reopen direct access to EU financial services markets had failed.Sunak was downbeat on the prospects for a new regulatory deal with the EU, but insisted that the City of London was well placed to serve a fast growing China ""financial services market with total assets worth 40 trillion pounds ($47.8 trillion)."" He believes the UK can strike a balance in dealing with China between having political differences and boosting cooperation on trade and economy. However, there are also hard-liners like Foreign Secretary Elizabeth Truss who intends to intensify relations with China and make greater efforts to serve the US strategy to contain China. Elizabeth Truss said on June 30 that ""the West must learn from its mistakes in failing to deter Russia's invasion of Ukraine and apply those lessons to protect peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait,"" Reuters reported.  To compare the Ukraine crisis with the Taiwan question, a matter of China's sovereignty and core interest and one that has nothing to do with other countries, is a typical narrative used by some West politicians who want to replicate the mess they had made in EU in Asia, so that they can spark more chaos and make more regions suffer from bloc vs. bloc confrontation, and they have no idea how dangerous it would be to support and encourage secessionists in Taiwan island to interrupt China's national reunification process, experts said.  The UK undoubtedly believes that it's a ""core member of the West following the US"" in terms of politics, diplomacy and military matters, but the UK also believes it is necessary to maintain cooperation with other major economies, especially China, on issues such as economy and trade or global climate change, Cui said. However, ""as the US is making great efforts to push competition with China, this may make it more difficult for the UK to find a balance between the two major powers,"" Cui said, because the US is demanding its allies, including the UK, to stand closer with it, not just in terms of political security, but also in terms of technology and other issues.The future of the UK is also in question. It could be more certain and stabler with more opportunities, but could also be risky and full of uncertainties and tensions, said Wang.""To what extent the UK will be able to find its own place in the future international arena depends on how the new [UK] government is able to strike a balance between the maritime and continental powers, and the balance between traditional industries and the new digital and ecological economies,"" Wang remarked.",CHINA,DIPLOMACY,Britain's Prime Minister Boris Johnson makes a statement in front of 10 Downing Street in central London on Thursday.Photo:AFP,"Reporter, Beijing","Yang Sheng is a chief reporter at the Global Times covering Chinese politics, diplomacy and military.","{'UK': ('LOC', 7), 'Ukraine': ('LOC', 2), 'London': ('LOC', 1), 'Cui': ('LOC', 1), 'China': ('LOC', 1), 'Russia': ('LOC', 1), 'Asia': ('LOC', 1), 'Boris Johnson': ('PER', 6), 'Wang Yiwei': ('PER', 1), 'Theresa May': ('PER', 1), 'Cui Hongjian': ('PER', 1), 'Brexit': ('MISC', 4), 'Conservative': ('MISC', 3), 'Reuters': ('ORG', 1), 'BBC': ('ORG', 1), 'Tory': ('ORG', 1), 'Institute of International Affairs': ('ORG', 1), 'Renmin University of China': ('ORG', 1), 'Global Times': ('ORG', 2), 'Department of EU Studies': ('ORG', 2), 'China Institute of International Studies': ('ORG', 1), 'Bxi': ('ORG', 2), 'Bxit': ('ORG', 1)}"
229,Does the US face a bottomless pit of military aid as Ukraine crisis drags on?,Global Times,2022-07-11,"The Russia-Ukraine crisis has continued without an end in sight. Although US President Joe Biden vowed to stand with Ukraine for ""as long as it takes,"" war and Ukraine fatigue has been witnessed in the US and across many of its West allies, with the emergence of energy and food crises, soaring inflation and massive spending on Ukraine. In response, there are increasing doubts on how long the US and the West's support to Ukraine can sustain. For example, the New York Times on Saturday cited US officials and analysts claiming that it would be hard for the US and its allies to sustain the same level of material support as war fatigue grows on both sides of the Atlantic. ""Originally, the US intended to exploit Ukraine as a pivotal pawn to weaken Russia. Ironically, instead of dragging down Russia, the situation has been used by Moscow, in turn, to pin down the US and the West countries."" Song Zhongping, a China military expert and TV commentator, told the Global Times, ""The US' strategy may backfire on itself. Judging from the current situation, it has become increasingly difficult for Ukraine to defeat Russia. The longer the Ukraine crisis lasts, the more detrimental to the US and the West it will become.""Several US media outlets have expressed their concern over the US' massive spending on Ukraine. Fox News reported on Saturday that the US' funds so far committed to Kiev have already exceeded total US costs over the first five years in Afghanistan.Different from the war in Afghanistan, which was launched and operated by the US, the Russia-Ukraine conflict is a proxy war against Russia waged by the US, which involves many uncontrollable elements. Against this backdrop, ""The US and its allies will soon find out that their support for Ukraine is actually a bottomless pit and will end up bearing the consequences,"" Song noted. The Joe Biden administration on Friday announced another $400 million military drawdown package to Ukraine as it attempts to fend off Russia advances, added Fox News.US's practices of drawdown its own defense articles and services to support Ukraine is little more than robbing Peter to pay Paul. When US hopes to ramp up its war spending to aid Ukraine, it has to cut other parts of its defense program. Massive aid needed to support Ukraine has put the US into a dilemma. If the US continues to support Ukraine in this proxy war, it will be an increasingly heavy burden to the US, further dragging down the US' economy and sending inflation even higher. But if US gives up halfway, all its previous support will go down the drain. As the party that actually incited the Ukraine crisis, the US is shooting itself in the foot.The US has authorized $54 billion in military and other assistance to Ukraine, but doubts continue as to whether the funds are enough to sustain the country; while in the EU, its plan to offer assistance to Ukraine has faced significant obstacles, with a recent proposal of 1 billion euros stalling as Germany blocked a larger package of nearly 9 billion euros. More people in the US and the West will realize that as it is hard for Ukraine to obtain a success against Russia, massive West assistance to Ukraine will achieve nothing for themselves and only trigger more problems.

230,"Western governments should prioritize the interests of their own people, not their political careers: former Italian undersecretary",Global Times,2022-07-10,"Editor's Note:During the past decade, the world has increasingly witnessed a trend of ""the East is rising, and the West is declining"" in the spheres of economy, security and discourse power. West countries, particularly the US, plagued by internal woes, have sought the old path of passing the buck and instigating turmoil elsewhere to ease their own pressure. China, representative of the emerging countries, is proposing new solutions to global problems. By advocating win-win development, facilitating consultation and reconciliation and proposing a balanced and effective security mechanism, China is striving to build a community with a shared future for mankind.In the fifth piece of the series, Michele Geraci (Geraci), former Undersecretary of State at the Italy Ministry of Economic Development, refuted West slanders against China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region with his own experience of visiting the region when talking to Global Times (Global Times) reporter Yu Jincui. He suggested US and EU countries should ""never point fingers at others"" when it comes to human rights as they also have human rights issues in their own countries. Echoing China President Xi Jinping's call for China and the EU to add stabilizing factors to a turbulent world, Geraci said ""We should make EU and China become closer to each other.""Global Times: You have visited Xinjiang many times. Based on your observations, can you tell US about the differences between what you saw in Xinjiang and the region in West narratives? Why is the West perception of Xinjiang full of lies and smears?Geraci: I've been there a few times and I've talked to both members of the government and to common people. I have traveled around the region accompanied by officials, as it is normal given my role, but a lot more by myself and very freely, taking trains and taxis even close to the border with Pakistan. And I've noticed there is nothing different than other parts of China. The region has good development opportunities, especially in the fields of local food, green energy, wind and solar. It has the same economic and social potential as my home region in Italy, Sicily. Hence my strong interest in fostering closer cooperation.I tell you the truth, if I hadn't read the news, it would be impossible to feel that there is something different in Xinjiang than the rest of China. My sense is that the accusations of genocide are not true. The punishments on some individuals do not seem to be related to their ethnicity, or religion. Why should they? No one of the more critical analysts that I have spoken to has managed to answer this question satisfactorily. I believe the punishments are because people break the law. We know that the law in China is very strict, especially when general crime and political criticism coincide and some foreigners may not like it. But it has nothing to do with genocide or ad hoc targeting of certain minorities. Why should Uygurs be singled out in this campaign, while other minorities are not?Xinjiang is a border region and border regions always face problems in many countries around the world. But I want to be clear: I have seen nothing that suggests that there are targeted measures against ethnic or religious group per se. Why is the West perception of Xinjiang so negative? When you have geopolitical frictions between countries, like the US and China have, you always try to pick on problems. It's part of the narrative that some governments need to sell to their domestic audience. You need to do that for electoral reasons to create an external enemy that you want to fight so that the leader can be the hero who defeats the monster. I want to be honest: I am not even 100 percent sure that some West leaders care really about the livelihoods of Uygurs, just like they don't really care about those of Ukrainians. They are just fracture points in geopolitical games and innocent people are used as pawns.Global Times: China and EU have differences on human rights issues. To what extent will this affect China-EU relations? How do you see the EU following in the US footsteps to point fingers at China over human rights issues?Geraci: I think many countries around the world have human rights issues in their own countries, some bigger than others. My answer is never to point fingers at others. I prefer to focus on the problems of my own country as we, too, have human rights problems in the West of a different type: we have freedom of speech, but we also have crime and violence especially toward women that go unpunished for political reasons or because some governments do not put the needed amount of resources into it. Children should have the right to go to school without fears of being shot dead just because the gun industry has strong lobbyists. So before addressing other countries' problems, we need to solve our own. We cannot preach what we do not practice. It's fine that the issues are raised and that the West asks China about human rights. But it should be a question, not an answer. It should be used to bring the issues up, not used as accusation. The paradox is that we always say that our juridical system is more advanced than that of China and we are proud of the separation between juridical and legislative systems: well then, let's have a court of justices issue sentences, not random members of parliaments or governments, let alone researchers or journalists. Global Times: China believes that China and the EU should add stabilizing factors to a turbulent global situation. How can China-EU relations maintain its stability to cope with the instability of international situation?Geraci: I'm a professor, half politician, and half economist, so I always say, in addition to trade, exchange of people, tourism, academic exchanges between professors, students and scientific corporations will help. We should make EU and China become closer to each other. If EU companies see that they do benefit from the relationship with China, then this will also help China gain a partner in EU that shares the view that cooperation is beneficial to both. The geopolitical problems come because people think that it's a zero-sum game - if you win, I lose. We need to create an environment that we both really gain from each other.One of the main worries that EU companies have is reciprocity and equal access to the China market. So, I think one good step that China could do is to send a signal that foreign investors are welcomed in China, that they are treated equally like China companies. China could by lowering barriers send a political sign that it's not unbalanced.Global Times: Now, let's talk about the Russia-Ukraine conflict. The situation in Ukraine is now the focus of the world. From a non-EU perspective, NATO's eastward expansion to Russia's doorstep is the root cause of the Russia-Ukraine conflict. As a EU, what do you think of the five times of eastward expansion of NATO?Geraci: This is always a dual misunderstanding between Russia and NATO. Russia is afraid that NATO expansion will threaten Russia's national integrity, and it may end being broken up like Yugoslavia. They have a point. And the NATO says that their expansion does not pose a threat to Russia, because NATO is a defensive organization. They also have a point. I give you a balanced view. The main problem is that for 10 years, Russia and the West have not really held an open and clear dialogue to understand each other. Why is one side doing certain things and why the other side is doing other things? The lack of mutual understanding is the root cause.Global Times: Responding to the Russia-Ukraine conflict, the US and the EU have slapped sanctions on Russia. Are sanctions a useful tool? What have sanctions brought about to EU? Geraci: Economic sanctions in general do not work. They did not work in Cuba. It is very difficult for economic sanctions to make an impact toward their goals. In this case, the goal is peace in Ukraine. The EU is making several mistakes because they are imposing sanctions without doing the proper analyses before. I've never seen any impact analysis of the sanctions on Russia and on EU done by the EU Commission. I've seen analysis done by other people, but done after the EU imposed sanctions, which is not an input into the decision-making process.This is a big mistake of method. I teach my students that we first need to do the analysis, then we value the impact on our own economies and on Russia, then we balance, wait, and decide if we think they are instrumental toward achieving peace. Instead, the EU did the opposite. This is not the right way, because it does not help stop war, but in fact the opposite.Gas and Oil prices have gone up because of the war, but also because of the sanctions of the EU and therefore, since we keep on buying same quantities of oil and gas, Russia's current account balance is much stronger than last year.  Russia's current account surplus more than tripled in the first four months of the year to $95.8 billion, the central bank said. My team and I at both Nottingham University Ningbo and New York University Shanghai, have done the analysis and our conclusions are that these six packages of sanctions are hurting only the EU economy and are neutral, to even positive, for the Russia economy. Global Times: Many developing countries, such as India, expressed different positions from that of the US and EU regarding the Russia-Ukraine conflict. What are the implications? Geraci: Perhaps they share my view that without analysis they cannot make the decision to join, because they themselves don't know if the impact will be good or bad. Take India. Modi has to look after 1.2 billion people in India. The interests of many leaders around the world are to look after their own people. So, they would join one or other sanctions only if they see this is good for them. But no one, including the EU, has shown them the analysis, because there is no analysis. The EU and the US simply ""demanded"" that those countries join in sanctioning Russia, without being clear on what basis.In fact, there is another aspect that we need to consider. If a country remains neutral, it can actually play a negotiating role. Staying away from sanctions, like China, India and the remaining 86 percent of the world population is doing, could give those countries the opportunity to perhaps be a mediator between Russia and Ukraine. On the other hand, if you put sanctions and take sides like the EU and certain EU governments did, you are out of the negotiating process. This indicates that the actions of certain governments are not really aimed at finding a path to peace, but only to ""be seen"" to be doing something, only for electoral purposes. A very cynical attitude.Global Times: If EU wants to achieve lasting peace and stability with Russia, what kind of security mechanism does it need?Geraci: It's a little bit outside my area. As an economist, I always make a quote that is very famous. If goods cross borders, armies won't. So, I think one of the best ways to work for the security is to have people trade with each other. That's why I mean in any security arrangement we need to trade.I think Russia should go back into the G8 and maybe even China. We need to enlarge the G7 to allow Russia to be in the table so that we can hear what the Russia say every day. And Russia can hear what the Europeans say every day, not just once every year at the G20. I have been at a few G20 meetings, they are nice to meet other leaders, but they are not the best place to discuss things.So, we need to bring Russia into the group of G7 countries, trade more not less, because trade is a way to understand each other. We need more exchange of people, more cooperation between universities and students. Surely, we need to lift the ban that the EU has imposed on Russia media. Today, EU citizens have no access to Russia media. Basically, we are ignorant about Russia. We need to fill this gap because ignorance creates problems. This is where I see the medium-term solution after the war is over. We cannot forget the geography. Russia is in EU for a large part of the population and GDP. So, we need to find a way to work with it. We must care about peace. In order to achieve peace, sometimes you need to swallow some bitter bites. So even if it means to negotiate with Russia, even if it means to swallow something, and take some losses, I think this is worth doing if it means saving lives. The world is not perfect and we make compromises in our lives, every day, with our bosses, our friends and our families.Global Times: How do you view the US role in the Russia-Ukraine conflict? Geraci: EU has always relied on the US as a military ally and we continue to do so. The EU army is not comparable to that of the US so we cannot have an independent army without the help of the US. So, we will always rely on them. Even the efforts to create a EU army are marginal compared to the power of the US military.Many EU citizens have already believed that this war is a threat to the EU. Many people think it's not a war between Russia and Ukraine, but a proxy war between the US and Russia, using Ukraine as a sacrificial pawn. Smart countries like the US do not fight wars on their territory, but shift the battlefield far away, even if, we must recognize, it is also their young soldiers who pay the price for the choices of their government.

231,"Sri Lankan president, prime minister to resign after protesters stormed their houses and offices",GT staff reporters,2022-07-10,"Sri Lanka's economic crisis has become a political one as both the country's president and prime minister agreed to resign Saturday after protesters stormed the official residences of the two leaders, setting fire to the prime minister's residence. Experts believe the country's crisis is a result of both internal and external troubles, including galloping inflation, its economic system, and the onslaught of COVID-19.As the capital Colombo descended into chaos, many foreign media, especially India media, increased their efforts to throw mud at China by hyping ""China debt trap diplomacy"" in Sri Lanka. The most jaw-dropping rhetoric is the accusation that it caused the current economic crisis in the Asia country. Experts believe these tricks have long been used by green-eyed India politicians who want to remove China's influence from the region, and experts warned such hype will do nothing to help the country in crisis, but only add fuel to the fire.  Sri Lankan President Gotabaya Rajapaksa on Saturday informed the country's parliament speaker Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena that he will resign from office on July 13, the Xinhua News Agency reported on Sunday. The speaker's office told Xinhua that the president made the decision following a request by political party leaders. Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe also agreed to resign earlier in the day after party leaders in the parliament urged both him and the president to step down, according to Xinhua.On Saturday, protesters stormed the president's residence and office, and the prime minister's residence was set on fire, Xinhua reported.Sri Lanka's opposition political parties were meeting Sunday to agree on a new government, Associated Press reported.Approaching the president's official residence at Sunday noon, a Global Times reporter based in Colombo saw large groups of protesters and civilians had swarmed into the residence. Protesters posted photos of them lying on beds, working out in the gym and swimming in the swimming pool. Some protesters mimicked politicians having meetings in meeting rooms. There were a large number of military personnel and police outside the residence, and one of the police officers told the Global Times that people are coming and going as they please. The in-house facilities in the residence were damaged to a certain extent, said the officer, although he said that the situation is relatively safe. The protest is fueled by economic turmoil which has plunged the India Ocean island nation of 22 million into a crisis, leaving many struggling to buy food, medicine and fuel, according to some analysts.The China Embassy in Sri Lanka on Saturday reminded China nationals not to participate in or watch any protests.  It urged China nationals in Sri Lanka to pay close attention to the local security situation and abide by local laws and regulations, after the protests had caused multiple injuries.Yang Shiyuan, chief media officer at the China Chamber of Commerce in Sri Lanka, told the Global Times over the weekend that both China personnel and China-funded projects are so far unaffected.A person with a large state-owned energy infrastructure company told the Global Times on Sunday that with warnings from the China Embassy, their staff are all well behaved and disciplined. ""There are no problems with the safety of personnel and projects here,"" the person said in Sri Lanka.""Enterprises here are basically at a standstill due to the lack of electricity and oil, but we're safe now despite the protests,"" Zhang Xudong, president of Sri Lanka Overseas China Association, told the Global Times on Sunday.""We are operating a brick factory using local coal ash waste, which was affected by the pandemic before and only started to resume operations in March and April. But given the current situation, we intend to close it due to the high daily expenses,"" he noted.Wang Huahua, a China national who is in Colombo, told the Global Times on Sunday that China people are relatively safe in the city, as the protest is mainly targeted at the government. She said many shops were closed and it was difficult to hail a taxi. According to Wang, who is a gemstone businesswoman, the country's dire situation began in March, when power outages lasted even 10 or 13 hours a day. Cars and motorcycles would line up for miles for days in front of a gas station but fail to get fuel, according to Wang.Beset with inside, outside troublesChinese observers believe Sri Lanka's woes stem from internal and external problems.Sri Lankans for the past months have endured shortages of fuel, food and other essentials and daily power outages. Most of those items are paid for in hard currency, but Sri Lanka is on the brink of bankruptcy, with dwindling foreign reserves and saddled with $25 billion in foreign debt. Nearly $7 billion is due this year, the Associated Press reported in April. According to Qian Feng, director of the research department at the National Strategy Institute at Tsinghua University, the most direct blow is the galloping global inflation, which gave rise to food and energy prices, and is making it more difficult for the country to pay its foreign debts. The US raising its benchmark interest rate has devaluated the Sri Lankan rupee, and ""global inflation has increased the prices of bulk commodities, which have piled on the woes for the country's foreign reserve shortages,"" Qian told the Global Times on Sunday. Qian believes it is a ""vicious cycle"" as Sri Lanka has to pay debt interest in foreign currency, but the shortage made it default on debt, which caused international organizations to downgrade its rating and further impact its ability to borrow.  Sri Lanka's currency has collapsed by 80 percent, making imports more expensive and worsening the inflation that is already out of control, with food costs rising 57 percent, the Associated Press cited official data as reporting on Sunday.Liu Zongyi, secretary-general of the Research Center for China-South Asia Cooperation at the Shanghai Institutes for International Studies, told the Global Times on Sunday that due to the country's policy of tax cuts, local consumers buy a lot of imported products, further reducing foreign exchange reserves.Aside from inflation, another factor is the Russia-Ukraine crisis which has raised oil prices, also have impact on countries, such as Sri Lanka, that depend on imports.Moreover, tourism, the country's pillar industry, has flatlined under the onslaught of COVID-19, said Qian. However, the root cause is its own economic and social system. Sri Lanka is a welfare state with a debt-financed model of economic growth. That is to say, it relies on heavy borrowing to meet the needs of production and life without producing much of its own output, Liu noted.Currently, the options include asking for loans or assistance from international organizations and other countries and regions to pull them out of this temporary economic dilemma, said experts. They noted that China can offer help such as constructing the maritime Silk Road. But fundamentally, the country needs systematic reform to shake off its overdependence on tourism.  At the end of June, China donated 1,000 tons of rice to Sri Lanka, which is enough for 1.1 million students for half a year.Hyping 'debt trap'Shortly after Sri Lanka descended into tumult, some media, especially India media, began to hype the impact of China's ""debt trap diplomacy"" on the country's current crisis.In an article published by IANS, a private India news agency, Red Lantern Analytica, an India-based think tank, was quoted as saying, ""In response to Sri Lanka's financial crisis, China employed its devious 'Debt Trap Diplomacy' to gain a strategic edge over the nation and hold its economy hostage."" The article also contributed to Sri Lanka's crisis to the ""China debt trap."" This article has been published in many India media outlets, including the Business Standard and the India Express. China observers said the hype is an attempt by India politicians to paint China's cooperation with other Asia countries as an attempt to ""encircle"" India, thus they are trying to push China's influence out of this region. ""Using the economic crisis of Sri Lanka as an excuse, India is sparing no effort to throw mud at China and pull Sri Lanka further to its own camp in order to expand its influence,"" Liu said.Two essential facts are ignored when the media in the West deals with the external debt of Sri Lanka: the composition of the debt and the real causes of the debt.  China's share of the external public debt of Sri Lanka is only 10 percent. West financial institutions, including the private credit markets, and their ally Japan, hold the lion's share of the debt, Hussein Askary, vice president of the Belt and Road Institute in Sweden, wrote in a piece published by the Global Times last month.Liu noted that China's investment in Sri Lanka are mostly production projects, which not only increase the productivity of the economy, but also stimulate employment, while most investment from Japan and India are consumption-led projects.Qian believes that such hyping or pointing fingers will achieve nothing, or may even worsen the situation in Sri Lanka. ""Countries that are willing to help better offer concrete plans and assistance instead of starting a propaganda machine to smear China.""",CHINA,DIPLOMACY,"Protesters gather near the presidential palace in Colombo, Sri Lanka on July 9, 2022.

232,China stresses true multilateralism at G20 FMs' meeting amid US attempt to split bloc over Russia-Ukraine conflict,Zhang Hui,2022-07-08,"China stressed the significance of true multilateralism, openness and inclusiveness within the framework of G20 at the G20 foreign ministers' meeting on Friday, with China observers saying China's stance reflected the voices of developing countries and emerging economies in seeking equal and joint efforts in tackling acute global challenges amid a US-led small bloc's attempt to split the G20 by inciting confrontation between camps over the Russia-Ukraine conflict. In a speech at the G20 foreign ministers' meeting held in the Indonesian resort island of Bali, China State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi called for upholding true multilateralism, carrying out win-win cooperation, and achieving inclusiveness and connectivity within the framework of the G20. In addition to China, many G20 members including current G20 presidency holder Indonesia and the UN highlighted multilateralism at Friday's event. Indonesian Foreign Minister Retno Marsudi said that safeguarding multilateralism and carrying out effective cooperation are the only way to address global challenges.UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said multilateralism is not an option but a must, expressing hope that countries will fully practice multilateralism with actions, promote connectivity, openness and inclusiveness so as to better deal with pressing challenges.The G20 members should be partners with mutual respect and consultation on an equal footing, Wang said.A country putting its own security above the security of others and strengthening military blocs can only lead to division in the international community and will make itself less safe, Wang said.Wang stressed that China will continue to urge peace talks and promote dialogue on the Ukraine issue, and always stands on the side of peace.Country-to-country competition should be fair, and should not be vicious competition or even malicious confrontation, Wang noted, adding that the exclusionary policy of ""small yard, high fence"" runs counter to the trend of the times and is only doomed to failure. 

Developing countries matter in the G20. Graphic: GTChinese analysts believed China's stance is a strong driving force for the G20 to stick to the right direction of development, which is upholding true multilateralism, and this helps to ensure that the G20 will not be split or see antagonism between members due to geopolitical conflicts incited by the US and its allies.Yang Xiyu, a senior research fellow at the China Institute of International Studies, told the Global Times on Friday that China's position and propositions that are in line with the right direction of G20 development will certainly have a very important and far-reaching impact on the G20 development process, including this year's G20 Summit.The G20 framework is one of the most effective mechanisms for constructive discussion between developed and developing countries, and its role should not be downplayed but is even more critical in an increasingly complex global geopolitical landscape, Diao Daming, an associate professor at the Renmin University of China in Beijing, told the Global Times on Friday.Yang said that the essence of true multilateralism China is upholding is that all countries, big or small, have equal sovereignty, which precisely reflects the aspiration of developing countries, including the current G20 presidency Indonesia. In comparison, the key of the US' exclusive club is that the US' and its allies' sovereignty and security is higher than that of other countries, and that of big countries is higher than smaller countries, Yang said. Retno said at the opening of the foreign ministers' meeting that multilateralism is the only mechanism where all countries, big or small, stand on an equal footing and are treated equally, and the voices of all countries, whether they are developing or developed, must be heard. She said the foreign ministers' meeting included two sessions, with the first on strengthening multilateralism and the second addressing food and energy security. However, according to Russia Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, the West partners did not follow the mandate of the G20 in dealing with issues of the world economy. Lavrov said the West's discussion ""strayed almost immediately"" as soon as they took the floor to criticism of Russia in connection with the situation in Ukraine, Al Jazeera reported on Friday. US officials said before the meeting that they were determined not to allow distractions to divert attention from what they believe should be the primary focuses, which was the disruption to world food and energy supplies caused by Russia's military operation against Ukraine and blaming Moscow for it, AP reported. The global food crisis is a humanitarian and economic problem arising from the unbalanced development of the world economy and supply chain issue, and should be dealt with through joint efforts, but the US and the West treat the food crisis as a geopolitical issue, insisting it was caused by Russia, Yang said, noting that it seemed to the West that global food insecurity would not exist without the Ukraine issue.Lü Xiang, a research fellow from the China Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times on Friday it was the economic sanctions imposed by the US and some of its allies on Russia that caused the global economic breakdown, and the impact was not only limited to Russia, but also extended to many other countries. US President Joe Biden pinned his hopes on these sanctions to bring down Russia, but ironically, they have only resulted in economic suffering for the US and EU, he said.Agence France-Presse reported that the US has sought to isolate Russia, and aides to US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said they saw no point in speaking to Lavrov.The US and G7 were wrong to avoid meeting or talking with Lavrov, and more negotiations between Russia and Ukraine and between Russia and the US should be conducted to jointly solve the Ukraine issue, Lü said. The US has this clear goal of attempting to turn G20 into an enlarged G7, bringing what the G7 believes should be the hot topics to the G20's table and forcing G20 members to make moves consistent with G7 on Russia, Yang said, noting that the US and G7 members tried to reverse the direction in which the G20 should be going. The US' and its allies' attempt to whip up bloc confrontation at the G20 could weaken the joint efforts of the G20 members and undermine global cooperation in dealing with urgent economic challenges, analysts warned.But the US' attempt of building an anti-Russia alliance at G20 will not succeed, as many countries do not share a similar stance with the US-led West bloc and expect the Ukraine crisis to be solved through diplomatic consultation rather than exerting pressure, which creates more conflicts, analysts said.The course of the world is no longer decided by West countries, and G20, which has much broader membership than G7, including the emerging markets of China, Brazil, South Africa and India, is not and will not become an expanded G7 as the US wants, analysts said.",CHINA,DIPLOMACY,Indonesian Foreign Minister Retno Marsudi (right) greets Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi during their bilateral meeting ahead of the G20 Foreign Ministers' Meeting in Nusa Dua on Thursday.

233,Johnson resignation epitome of UK’s social governance crisis,Gao Jian,2022-07-09,"Boris Johnson on Thursday stepped down as leader of the Conservative Party after dozens of staff members quit their posts, making way for a new prime minister. This means Boris Johnson becomes another UK politician who cannot complete the tenure as prime minister after Theresa May. UK's frequent changes of political leaders since Brexit in 2016 are an inevitable result of a combined effect of UK domestic politics and global political development. This mirrors the social governance crisis and structural contradictions in economic development prevailing in West countries and the US.Boris Johnson's resignation is something that will happen sooner or later. Compared with May, Boris Johnson lacks a real sense of mission and responsibility for UK politics, and he does not have the political literacy to turn the tide in a crisis. During Boris Johnson's administration, opportunism has completely replaced the seriousness of political life, and to a large extent dwarfed UK's international image. His ""Partygate"" scandal has heavily undermined the public image of the government.However, an overemphasis on Boris Johnson's personal factors is far from sufficient to explain the primary reason why he has been abandoned by the Conservative Party. The UK's current political turmoil did not start with Boris Johnson, and will not end with him. In fact, since Brexit, the UK government has essentially lost its overall sense of direction in constructing the future. Chaos and disorder are the main features of UK political life. Since Brexit, the livelihood issues of UK society have not only not been alleviated, but also become more prominent because of the involvement of the novel coronavirus. However, the Conservative government has not come up with policies to fundamentally address social and livelihood issues. The inanition and formalization of political life has become a fundamental chronic disease of UK society.Boris Johnson is essentially the epitome and embodiment of contemporary UK political life. The UK Conservative Party's more evident populist image fully indicates that the UK society today is incapable of producing politicians who can truly take responsibility and make a difference. The banality of UK political life at a critical moment in national development is by no means an accident.Similar to the internal social governance, UK's foreign policy is also in a period of difficult choices. In 2016, ""Global UK"" was first mentioned by Boris Johnson and May. Objectively speaking, ""Global UK"" diplomatic strategy is indeed a forward-looking diplomatic plan based on the laws of development, and it also fully embodies the strategic literacy and level of UK as a senior participant in international affairs. However, over the past years, UK's diplomatic practice has fundamentally turned its back on the diplomatic framework of its own ""Global Strategy.""The essential feature of the current UK diplomacy is that it has returned to the basic orientation of its traditional special relationship with the US in the post-Cold War period. UK is actively serving as the pawn of US' global hegemonic foreign policy, and playing the role of strategist in the alliance of the US and the West, in a bid to ramp up its discourse power in international foreign affairs and chips in dealing with diplomatic relations with non-West countries. Take China-US relations as an example. Since Boris Johnson took office, UK's foreign policy toward China has still been stuck in the barriers of Cold War mentality and colonial cultural ideology. Some powerful politicians in the Conservative Party have spared no effort to ideologicalize China-UK relations, but they have never been able to break away from the theory of West civilization's superiority and the West value-centered theory, which has triggered essential damage to UK's diplomatic interests in China. It should be noted that such deep-rooted political forces that go against the trend of the world are not a minority in UK politics. Therefore, the development of UK's foreign policy will not fundamentally change because of Boris Johnson's resignation. UK diplomacy needs a true ""ideological emancipation."" Has the UK political circle braced it?Although in terms of economy, the UK has been a power that cannot be underestimated, its advantages are on decline. Days ago, UK Foreign Secretary Elizabeth Truss even said the UK wants to seize the assets of Russia in the UK in order to give them to Ukraine. Such a strategy is a fundamental trampling on the UK's notion on business. Today, the UK's image and reputation seem to be at its lowest since the UK Empire.

234,It’s time for G20 mechanism to loosen taut strings of the world: Global Times editorial,Global Times,2022-07-09,"The G20 Foreign Ministers' Meeting (FMM) took place on Thursday and Friday in Bali, Indonesia, focusing on urgent issues such as the food and energy crisis. In the context of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, geopolitics has undoubtedly undermined the G20. The US and West countries had said that ""there can be no return to business as usual with the Kremlin,"" and even a family photo after the meeting was not arranged. These ""off-site factors"" have all underlined the necessity to ensure that the themes and agenda of the G20 are not derailed.The spillover effects of the Russia-Ukraine conflict are being transmitted to different parts of the world. On the two days of the G20 FMM, the UN agencies released consecutive reports, warning that ""soaring inflation rates have seen an increase in the number of poor people in developing countries by 71 million in the three months since March 2022."" Its impact on poverty rates has been much faster than that of COVID-19 pandemic, and 45 countries need external food aid. All this illustrates the seriousness and urgency of the problem. The world is in a race against time to prevent the crisis of cost of living from developing into a social and political crisis that in turn sparks wider unrest and conflict.Exploring ways to alleviate the extreme plight of fragile countries and stabilize global food and energy markets as soon as possible should have been the theme of the G20 FMM, which is also what countries in deep crisis expected from the meeting. Regrettably, this meeting failed to issue a joint communiqué. The Associated Press noted that ""deeply divided top diplomats from the world's richest and largest developing nations failed to find common ground Friday over Russia's war in Ukraine and how to deal with its global impacts, leaving prospects for future cooperation in the forum uncertain.""The G20 members represent more than 80 percent of world GDP, 75 percent of international trade and 60 percent of the world population. It is the most powerful and representative communication and coordination mechanism in the world today. The ""big trouble"" the world is currently encountering needs to be addressed through consultation by all members of the G20. West media said that the Russia-Ukraine crisis divides the bloc into so-called pro-Russia and anti-Russia camps, but this also reminds the West that it needs to step out of the small circle of G7 and NATO and listen to different voices and the real concerns of most other countries.Some West countries have previously demanded that host Indonesia kick Russia ""out of the G20"" and threatened to ""walk out of the meeting"" if Russia attends. This time, foreign ministers finally sat together, which shows a kind of rationality. It is unrealistic for the G20 to completely focus on the Russia-Ukraine conflict, and the world cannot be permanently trapped in the confrontation it has caused. The US and the West are acting like dealers. They deal the card ""responsible for food crisis"" to Russia, and deal the card ""responsible for debt crisis"" to China. This is a geopolitical calculation to evade responsibility. Doing so will eventually result in a backlash. Food and energy issues are structural problems arising from the Russia-Ukraine conflict. In fact, the US Federal Reserve's continuous interest rate hikes are also a vital reason for the pressure on developing countries. To resolve the current crises, the US and major West powers should play a leading role. But the reality is, countries including Indonesia are actively mediating between Russia and Ukraine on the G20 platform. China has fully implemented the G20 Debt Service Suspension Initiative, and has provided the largest amount of debt relief among G20 members. On the other hand, the US and West major powers, which are supposed to offer dividends for world peace and development, have made the smallest contribution.  The US and the West countries should do much more, no matter from the perspective of moral responsibility or their practical ability. What they bring to the G20 should not be just disputes, but also solutions to problems. For example, developed countries are supposed to play a greater role in reducing the debt burden on developing countries, and US should use more financial means to help developing countries resolve their difficulties, instead of focusing on smearing others of creating ""debt trap.""G20 played an important role in dealing with the 2008 financial crisis. Now, with the world facing another upheaval, it is time for it to play its due role again. China has successively put forward the Global Development Initiative and a Global Security Initiative, calling for abandoning the Cold War mentality, opposing unilateralism, and saying no to group politics and bloc confrontation. This is both a solemn initiative and a rational voice. Without security, there can be no development. Without development, security is just like a tree without roots. As UN Secretary-General António Guterres said on Thursday, no country can solve the challenges alone and multilateralism is needed more than ever.The strings of the world have been taut for too long, and it's time to loosen them. This requires collective rationality and joint action.",OPINION,EDITORIAL,G20 Indonesia Photo:VCG,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{""G20 Foreign Ministers ' Meeting"": ('MISC', 3), 'FMM': ('MISC', 1), 'G20 FMM': ('MISC', 5), 'COVID': ('MISC', 1), '19': ('MISC', 1), 'G': ('MISC', 3), 'Bali': ('LOC', 1), 'Indonesia': ('LOC', 1), 'Russia': ('LOC', 6), 'Ukraine': ('LOC', 4), 'US': ('LOC', 1), 'West': ('LOC', 3), 'Kremlin': ('LOC', 1), 'UN': ('ORG', 1), 'Associated Press': ('ORG', 1), 'NATO': ('ORG', 1)}"
235,"10 years on, world views China as established power different from West: GT surveys",Yang Sheng,2022-07-09,"Editor's Note:Ten years ago, when China had just become the second-largest economy in the world for three years, the world was still cautiously observing whether China could develop sustainably and some from the West were even predicting that the story of China's rise would end up with its collapse. But today, China has already become a major world power with undoubted strength and influence able to reshape the global order. Through reviewing the surveys and questionnaires done by the Global Times Research Center involving participants from around the globe in the past decade, we find that the world's recognition of China's development has increased in the past 10 years and that the world has generally recognized the strength of China. Now the world has entered another stage, which holds mixed views on how a powerful China with ambition and confidence will change the world. ""Do you think China is a world power?"" This seems like a question with an easy answer today, but this is the first question of the annual global questionnaire on ""China's International Image and International Position"" from 2012 to 2017 done by the Global Times Research Center.Analysts said that China was very humble and keeping low profile but eager to know how the world would evaluate and comment about its development, even though China has surpassed Japan by becoming the second-biggest economy around the globe in 2010. As the China people are learning to be citizens of a great power, the world is also learning to adapt to a rising China with fast growing strengths in every aspect. From questioning the sustainability of China's development, to getting used to the fact that China is a major world power with global influence, the world has also been through a process of understanding China in the past decade.Today, the world's views on China are complicated, with developing countries considering on how to benefit from China's development and to what extent a powerful China would like to reform the global order that's dominated by the West; the West is anxious that the unstoppable growth of China could comprehensively change the existing world order which serves the interests of a small group of countries, some of which are seeking ways for a peaceful coexistence with China, while others are pushing competition and confrontation to contain China. Rising confidenceThe Global Times Research Center has carried out surveys every year to collect data on public opinion about China from different countries across the world and also to investigate international issues related to China. These surveys have reflected the process of how the views on China around the globe changed over the past decade. According to the 2012 surveys involving participants from major countries worldwide including the US, Russia, the UK, Brazil, India, South Africa, Japan and Germany, only 53 percent of the interviewees believed that China was a world power, and in 2017, when participants from more countries (France, Spain, Australia, Indonesia, South Korea, Ukraine and Vietnam) were involved in the surveys, 83 percent recognized China as a world power. Zhang Yiwu, a professor at Peking University, said ""This just proves that the world view of China's identity as a world power is getting deep-set around the globe,"" as this has become a reality especially after a clearly sustainable, convincing and successful development of the country in the first half of the past decade.Shen Yi, a professor specializing in cyberspace and international relations at Fudan University, told the Global Times that this change in perception demonstrates that as long as people around the globe can access correct and objective information, they will inevitably be able to recognize the development of China and draw sensible conclusions.But recognizing China's strength doesn't necessarily mean the recognition of China's political system and the path of socialism with China characteristics, so when observing the rise of China, the West, which dominates the international field of public opinion, is trying to downplay the significance of China's development, analysts said. Many West mainstream media outlets often report news about China through a biased lens and according to their own agendas, and some West politicians and scholars always look down upon China and smear China with false information such as ""the China collapse theory,"" but as long as China keeps developing and showing the world its achievements, those stigmatizing will naturally fade away, according to analysts.  Shen said the answers to questions like ""Do you think China is a world power"" show that China needed to seek recognition from others at the beginning, but in recent years the situation has changed a lot.""We are no longer hungry for recognition. The media outlets don't even need to explain to the world how powerful China is now. They just need to report the facts, such as China has launched its third aircraft carrier, and the world will know,"" Shen noted. As China's status as a world power has become unshakable, the West is trying to use a different way to describe the rise of China to make the world become afraid of China's growing strength, analysts said.

Photo taken on March 13, 2022 shows a scene of the performance during the closing ceremony of the Winter Olympic Games at the National Stadium in Beijing. Photo: Cui Meng/GTChanging viewsAs time goes by, the questions of the Global Times surveys have also changed. In 2018, the Donald Trump administration unilaterally launched a trade war against China, the questionnaire then no longer asked ""Do you think China is a world power?"" Instead it focused on the power comparison between China and the US, and which countries in the world find that they are benefiting from China's development.From looking down upon China to exaggerating China's rising power and even demonizing China's development through ""the China threat theory,"" the US and some of its West allies have changed their view and strategy in dealing with the unstoppable development of China in the past decade. Experts said the US has found that because of their hegemony and unreasonable dominance in many areas, they are now facing challenges and being shaken.The increasing recognition of China's power definitely brought on more pressure. Wang Yiwei, director of the Institute of International Affairs at Renmin University of China, told the Global Times that the survey shows a very evident fact: ""If China wasn't a world power, then its development would not make the US anxious. The US wouldn't launch all-out containment and suppression operations and regulations against a country that is unable to impact its hegemony.""More importantly, the US has failed to contain China. US has failed in the trade war it launched and now the US economy and US citizens are paying the price for the mistakes made by those arrogant US elites, analysts said.This is also making the rest of the world change their understanding of US hegemony. According to a 2018 survey covering 16,927 samples from 17 countries, 41.9 percent of the interviewees said that ""the US influence is gradually declining"" while 35.2 disagreed with such judgment. At the same time, 69.8 percent of the interviewees agreed that ""China is gradually rising"" while only 10.3 percent disagreed.Among the elites, this kind of opinion was even clearer. 51.2 percent of the elite participants agreed that the US influence is gradually declining, while 77.1 percent considered China to be on a gradual upward path. In 2019, many interviewees from both China (82.1 percent) and the US (41.2 percent) as well as other 15 countries (54.6 percent) around the globe thought the US influence to be declining, and the US image to be worsening. In 2020, most interviewees worldwide believed that ""it may not be easy for the US to succeed in the trade war and crackdown against China sci-tech firms like Huawei and TikTok and China will take counter-measures."" Apart from China and US interviewees, 54.8 percent of the participants from the other 14 countries held this opinion. More interestingly, those from major US allies and West countries showed even lower confidence in the US' crackdown against China or China firms, with the examples of Japan (67.1 percent), the UK (61.5 percent), Germany (60.8 percent) and France (60 percent).

Photo:cnsphotoGreater power, greater responsibilityThe rising power of China is not only making some in the West anxious, but also making many in the third world see the opportunity. With great power comes great responsibility. According to the global survey in 2017 that covered 16 countries worldwide, most interviewees worldwide, 66.4 percent, recognized China as a world power because of its economic strength, sci-tech strength (38.4 percent), military strength (31.7 percent), and political and diplomatic strength (30.5 percent).In 2019, when asked about ""which factors are related to China's rising international image or influence,"" most interviewees picked ""China's rapid economic development has driven the global economy"" (58.4 percent) and ""Some of China's technologies (5G, high-speed railway, mobile pay, etc.) lead the world"" (53.6 percent).This just proved that in the past 10 years, China has sustained its fast model of development, producing advanced sci-tech achievements, including high-speed railways, 5G networks, as well as the fast-developing aerospace industry that benefit not only China but also the world, said analysts. Through the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) that was firstly proposed by China in 2013, more and more countries have received benefits from China's development not only by trade but also by infrastructure projects and sci-tech cooperation, and more and more countries, especially the developing countries, have found that China is promoting a reform to fix the problematic globalization which used to be dominated by the US and some other West major powers, said experts. According to the 2020 data, on the question ""In which fields does your country need to further strengthen the communication and cooperation with China in the next few years,"" the Global Times survey found that comparing to the data from 2018, in 2020, other countries are no longer only focusing on an economic cooperation with China, but are increasingly looking forward to sci-tech cooperation with China.For instance, 66.6 percent of interviewees from Kenya considered that they should strengthen sci-tech cooperation with China. The interviewees from Ukraine (51.3 percent), South Africa (48.9 percent), Indonesia (47.8 percent) and Egypt (45.6 percent) also shared the same opinion.The 2020 survey found that the developing countries have higher desire to strengthen cooperation with China in economy, science and technology, and public health, while West countries and developed countries are more eager to strengthen diplomatic ties.The world has started viewing China differently, as now other countries have higher expectations about China, while they found the US and the West to be unable to solve the problems they care about, said Wang. ""Many West countries can't even solve their own problems. The Joe Biden administration has proposed the Build Back Better World plan to compete with the BRI, but many countries doubt the US' capability and determination, while the BRI has been joined by 150 countries worldwide,"" Wang noted.COVID-19 pandemic and the Russia-Ukraine crisis will surely bring a significant impact on the BRI, but in the long term, as long as China keeps developing and boosting interconnectivity between different countries and continents, the BRI is still the most reliable framework to help the world get rid of the shadow of recession and realize recovery, experts said.Future leadershipFrom 2019 to 2020, the Global Times survey has started to focus on China's influence and to what extent other countries worldwide expect China to play a leading role in global governance. In 2020, due to COVID-19 pandemic, the questions became more specific aiming to find out how the outbreak and China's epidemic control efforts would affect China's image. In 2020, the US and some countries who failed to control the pandemic and saw huge numbers of death have launched an operation of relentless stigmatization and misinformation against China on issues like virus origins tracing, trying to blame China through what can be only described as a propaganda warfare, some countries even proposing to demand compensation from China for their losses, which in fact were caused by their failed handling of the pandemic.This kind of ridiculous attempt to attack China has received limited effects. According to the survey in 2020 that covered 16,431 samples from 16 countries worldwide including not only the major West countries but also non-West regional powers like India, Indonesia, Egypt and South Africa, 56.5 percent of interviewees said they ""don't hate China because of COVID-19 epidemic breakout"" while there were only 26.2 percent said ""they do,"" and the rest said they were ""not sure.""Analysts said that from the time some West countries, especially the US, found that China has done better than them in fighting the pandemic and saving people's lives, they have refused to be humble and learn from China and fix their mistakes. Instead, they were trying their best to stigmatize China with a huge amount of misinformation to shift the blame of their failure on China, so they can still tell the fairy tale to their people that the West is still more ""civilized"" or ""modernized"" than China.So although there are 56.5 percent of the interviewees that said they don't hate China because of the pandemic, there are also quite a lot of interviewees across the globe who have been affected by the vicious propaganda warfare launched by the US to hate China, experts said, noting that this is a key reason why in many West countries, China's image is worsening in recent years.However, there are still 49.2 percent of participants worldwide who said they were ""surprised that China was able to effectively control COVID-19 epidemic,"" while 34.9 percent of them said they were not and the rest were unsure. According to the data of the survey, it shows that the people who still hold a positive view on China are mostly from non-West countries, while those who have negative views on China are mainly from the West countries. Zhang said all of this proves that in the past 10 years, China's international influence and image has generally improved, and attempts to stigmatize China are not successful. No matter how the US and other West countries pay efforts to stigmatize China, many non-West countries are benefiting from China whether in fighting the pandemic or realizing economic recovery, especially when West countries show arrogant and selfish attitudes toward the developing world amid the pandemic, so they know who's really being responsible when the world is experiencing challenges.The world is experiencing a transformation from an industrial civilization to a digital and ecological one, and China is trying to adapt to the change despite the pains caused by the pandemic, Wang noted.Ten years ago, China desperately wanted recognition from the world. Now it has the recognition but faces another question - how to make the world believe a powerful China will not act like a West hegemony, said analysts. In other words, China needs to prove itself with concrete actions and to show the world that it will bring contribution, protection and certainty, rather than destruction, chaos and turbulence caused by the US, experts noted. The world is now learning to coexist and cooperate with such a powerful and confident country with a long and brilliant civilization, which will very likely become the biggest economy of the world in the next decade. Although there are still many hostilities and biases against China in some parts of the world, China experts confidently said history will eventually tell the world who was right.Liu Caiyu, Zhang Han, Wan Hengyi contributed to the story

236,"NATO employs 30-year Europe-meddling ‘experience’ on Asia, meets with increasing opposition",Yi Bei,2022-07-07,"Editor's Note:Amid the still ongoing Russia-Ukraine military conflict, NATO, which has been adding fuel to the conflict, held a three-day summit in Madrid, Spain, from June 28 to 30. The NATO alliance has been working to increase pressure on Russia over its conflict with Ukraine while underscoring their continued concerns about China. For the first time in history, Japan and South Korea leaders were invited to attend the NATO Summit. The militant group which has already been a source of trouble for EU is now trying to create its own Asia-Pacific chapter to interfere in Asia. How did the organization come about? How was it born from the Cold War mentality and gradually became an obstructor of world peace? Why is this military alliance extending its ""black hand"" to Asia? The Global Times will publish a series of four articles on how NATO is expanding. This is the last installment.

The leaders of four Asia-Pacific countries, namely Japan, South Korea, Australia, and New Zealand have a meeting in Madrid during the NATO Summit on June 29. Photo: VCG In 1997, NATO formally invited Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic to join its ranks, laying the foundation for NATO's first eastward expansion in 1999 since end of the Cold War. In 2022, for the first time, the leaders of four countries - Japan, South Korea, Australia, and New Zealand - were invited to the NATO Summit in Madrid to seemingly set in motion NATO's expansion to the Asia Pacific. A review of NATO's history shows that it first enlisted EU against EU and the Soviet Union, then united EU against Russia, and now wants to pit Asia-Pacific countries against China. It is reasonable to say that as NATO expands eastward, it is creating divisions.The first NATO Secretary General, Lord Ismay, stated the organization's goal was ""to keep the Russia out, the US in, and the Germans down,"" and this speaks volumes about the role NATO has long played in EU.US tool to control EuropeIn the 1990s, former US deputy secretary of state Strobe Talbott, who is responsible for NATO's expansion after the Cold War, repeatedly claimed that NATO, despite being a military organization, had a broad political function, and that its expansion was a powerful drive for the ""Westernization"" of member countries' political and social systems.Indeed, for the US, NATO is undoubtedly a ""security community"" under the premise of ensuring US's absolute military superiority. This regional security architecture has three prominent features: The dominance of US hegemony, the hierarchy of states within the order, and explicit exclusionism.For a long time, the vast majority of the US political elite have said openly that NATO is the US' most important strategic resource for ensuring its global hegemony. Without NATO, the US would lose the tools to control EU countries, and it would be more difficult to promote the evolution of the security order in the Eurasian continent in line with the interests of US hegemony. Almost every major strategic shift in NATO's history has been US-led.Since the end of the Cold War, the US and EU have been at odds over whether NATO expansion should be limited to EU or extend beyond it. However, from the strong intervention in the Balkan Wars in the 1990s, to the intervention in Iraq and Afghanistan in the 2000s, and the current more frequent involvement in Asia-Pacific affairs, NATO has breached the limits of only dealing with EU affairs and constantly redefines its functions in line with the US' updated global strategy.Bringing 'EU division' to Asia-PacificIn the past 10 years, NATO, through global partnership schemes, has pooled the resources of Asia-Pacific allies to focus on ""dealing"" with the Afghan issue, and accelerated coordination on security and defense with Japan, South Korea, Australia, and New Zealand.Led by the US, NATO is rapidly applying the ""experience"" it has gained over the past 30 years in leading EU security by creating divisions in EU into the practical process of building security systems specific to the Asia-Pacific.In recent years, while constantly trying to promote the integration of existing alliance mechanisms in the Asia-Pacific region, the US has been pushing NATO to fully establish itself in Asia-Pacific as soon as possible in terms of institutions and actions.NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg has stressed on several occasions that NATO and its Asia-Pacific partners should strengthen practical cooperation in various areas, including maritime security and cyber technology.When the leaders of Japan, South Korea, Australia, and New Zealand attended their first NATO summit in late June, the political message was clear: There will be more frequent and deeper coordination between NATO and US allies in the Asia-Pacific. The idea of expanding NATO to Asia plays an obvious role in the US' Indo-Pacific Strategy.The US now hopes to adjust its existing alliance ties by strengthening small mechanisms so as to build a grand security system.

Photo: VCGNATO-led security system aimed at containing ChinaAs its strategic focus continues to shift eastward, the US has significantly accelerated the pace of the layout of the Asia-Pacific security framework. On the one hand, the US is pushing Asia-Pacific countries including Japan, South Korea, Australia, and New Zealand to strengthen ties and cooperation with NATO. On the other hand, US dignitaries including President Joe Biden have also visited other Asia-Pacific countries frequently, creating an international atmosphere of ""Sinophobia"" and promoting the alignment of the security and defense strategies of the visited countries with NATO. Through these means, the US wants to accelerate the formation of a regional and even global security system with NATO at its core to contain China.Such moves taken by the US are similar to what the US has been doing in EU to aggravate the conflict between NATO countries and Russia. The eastward expansion of NATO has led to the Russia-Ukraine conflict in EU as well as the last confrontation between Russia and NATO, and the great division of EU. So the ""Asianization"" of NATO, led by the US, will be disastrous to the Asia-Pacific region and undermine regional peace and prosperity. This military alliance will force Asia-Pacific countries to take sides between China and the US based on its logic of great power geopolitical competition, leading to increasingly intense regional crises and conflicts in the Asia-Pacific region, and it is likely to cause a major security and economic split in the Asia-Pacific region, thus severely interrupting the process of regional economic integration.According to the 2022 Strategic Concept adopted at the NATO Summit in Madrid (June 29-30), the military alliance has three core tasks over the next decade: Deterrence and defense, crisis prevention and management, and cooperative security. In terms of deterrence and defense, the US and its allies are increasing military spending, which will trigger an arms race in multiple regions and lead to regional tensions. In terms of crisis prevention and management, we must remember that NATO has carried out so-called ""crisis prevention and management"" in Yugoslavia, Iraq, Afghanistan, and other countries, and the consequences of these actions by US are obvious to the whole world. In terms of so-called ""cooperative security,"" if NATO wants to strengthen its presence in the Asia-Pacific region, it is likely to create a serious crisis in the Taiwan Straits and the China Sea. In this process, its so-called global partnership will be rapidly advanced. This process will also change the internal political, economic, and social systems of other countries. In the complex Asia-Pacific region, NATO's approach will inevitably lead to contradictions and conflicts.Undermining UN authorityIf the ""Asianization"" of NATO proceeds smoothly, a global NATO security pattern will eventually emerge. This will be at the heart of the US' global security blueprint, but it is not something that truly peace-loving nations would like to see. The North Atlantic Treaty states that the Parties to this Treaty reaffirm their faith in the purposes and principles of the Charter of the UN and their desire to live in peace with all peoples and all governments. NATO also claimed its ""collective defense"" commitment is based on the right of individual and collective self-defense guaranteed by Article 51 of the UN Charter. However, NATO waged the Kosovo war without UN authorization and it tampered with the UN resolution to launch a regime change war in Libya and constantly conducted military operations outside its defense zone. All these activities have demonstrated that NATO's missions and operations are a complete departure from the UN Charter. The organization has become increasingly offensive, and a ""weapon"" and accomplice of US hegemony. NATO is creating new divisions and bloc confrontations in the Asia-Pacific region by grading countries based on its own needs. This year, NATO hosted several meetings and the Madrid Summit to discuss the institutional arrangement of strengthening coordination with US allies in the Asia-Pacific regions. These meetings, without exception, hyped the ""China threat.""NATO's recent reiteration of the importance of establishing and setting international rules is noteworthy. It is true that the lasting stability of state-to-state relations cannot be achieved without adherence to international rules by all parties. However, a military alliance that advocates the theories of ""civilization superiority"" and ""sovereignty relativity,"" and meddles in bloc politics is unlikely to promote rules recognized by the vast majority of countries in the world. The future global security system must not be built around the alliance system of ""global NATO,"" but must return to the rational and healthy way of consolidating the core role of the UN.",IN-DEPTH,IN-DEPTH,South Koreans gather at Gyeongbokgung Palace in Seoul to protest South Korean President Yoon Suk-yeol's attendance of the NATO Summit on June 29.

237,Chinese FM lays out three points of concern on Ukraine crisis,Chen Qingqing,2022-07-07," China  laid out three points of concern for the Ukraine crisis during a meeting with India's foreign minister on Thursday, which was followed by a meeting with Russia diplomats during the ongoing G20 foreign ministers' meeting. China opposes using the crisis to instigate a Cold War mentality, comparing the Ukraine crisis with the Taiwan question and China is against unilateral sanctions imposed on China and other countries using the crisis as an excuse, Wang said. During a meeting with India External Affairs Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar on Thursday, Wang said that faced with an increasingly complex situation and its challenges, the world needs solidarity rather than division, and needs dialogue rather than confrontation. China opposes any act of instigating a Cold War mentality and confrontation, and it continues to firmly stand on the right side of history and on the side pushing for peaceful dialogue. China also opposes double standards and any act that damages China's sovereignty and territorial integrity, Wang said.  He noted that some countries emphasized the principle of sovereignty on the Ukraine question but constantly challenge China's sovereignty and the one-China principle on the Taiwan question, and this is clearly a double standard. The China senior diplomat said China opposes any intention of bringing the Ukraine crisis together with the Taiwan question and will safeguard China's  core interests.   Some countries, by using the Ukraine crisis as an excuse, imposed unilateral sanctions on China and other countries, which was unfair and illegitimate, hurting normal interactions between countries and violating international trade rules, Wang said. Such moves also expanded the crisis and made it more complex, which is something all sides should reject. ""China's three points of concern clearly show that hegemony is not welcome in handling global affairs, and hegemony is also the essential reason for the prolonged conflict between Russia and Ukraine,"" a Beijing-based expert on international affairs who preferred not to be named told the Global Times on Thursday. It also signals that the world needs more dialogue rather than the divisions created by the US to show its supremacy, as US hegemony is also the origin of a number of international crises and turmoil today, he said. Unlike the US, which has sought to turn this year's G20 into a chance to isolate Russia, China, along with some emerging powers, has been looking into more opportunities for economic recovery amid the COVID-19 pandemic and other concrete issues that could benefit both sides. Against the backdrop of the US and its allies attempting to contain Russia and China, Russia and China will continue to increase the scope and practical interaction, Russia Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said during the meeting with Wang, TASS reported. The position of Russia and China is gaining more support among other countries, in contrast to the openly aggressive policy of the West, which seeks to maintain its privileged position and dominance in global affairs, Lavrov said, noting that the Russia stance is gaining increasing support and appreciation among participants in international relations, according to the Russia media report. The main aim of the US-led West bloc at the G20 meeting is to further pressure Russia over the Ukraine crisis, as a US official was quoted as saying in a Reuters report on Thursday that ""this week's G20 meeting in Bali cannot be business as usual but the US is determined to ensure nothing happens there that can give legitimacy to Russia's 'brutalizing' of Ukraine,"" after the US, Japan and Germany officials revealed that they would echo the US intention of adding to the pressure on Russia at the meeting. Wang also met diplomats from Indonesia, Argentina and the EU on Thursday morning, Zhao Lijian, spokesperson of the China Foreign Ministry, told a routine press conference on Thursday afternoon. ""Wang is currently meeting with Lavrov, and will have bilateral meetings with those from the US, France, Germany, Spain, Netherlands, Canada, Australia, Singapore and Saudi Arabia later,"" Zhao said. While Wang and US Secretary of State Antony Blinken are expected to meet at the G20 meeting, the US side is looking to discuss putting up guardrails on the China-US relationship so the competition between the two countries ""does not spill over into miscalculation or confrontation,"" according to the website of the US Mission to ASEAN. Zhao also told the press conference that the three joint communiqués serve as the guardrails of US-China relations, and the US side should abide by the provisions in the documents and the promises it has made to China. As the most consequential bilateral relationship in the world, China-US relations should improve rather than deteriorate, he said. Some China experts believed that US will use this issue to pressure Beijing over the Russia-Ukraine conflict instead of really trying to improve US-China relations, and turn this multilateral platform designed to discuss economic cooperation into an anti-Russia and anti-China alliance, creating a contrast with China's approach of seeking dialogue with more countries. US's approach serves only its own interests, which will lead to more conflicts and divisions across the world, experts said. Apparently, when Russia attends some international cooperation mechanisms now, it faces unprecedented boycotts by the West, and this containment against the backdrop of the Ukraine crisis aims to isolate Russia from the international system, Yang Jin, an expert at the Institute of Russia, EU, and Central Asia Studies under the China Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times on Thursday. ""But China treats the G20 as a platform for global economic issues and cooperation, and is unwilling to politicize it, as it also serves as a bridge of engagement between developed and developing countries,"" Yang said, noting that if the ongoing G20 becomes a platform for sanctioning Russia, it would deviate from its main and original purpose. During a meeting with Indonesian foreign minister Retno Marsudi on Thursday, Wang said China is willing to work with developing countries including Indonesia to bring a collective voice against the Cold War mentality and bloc-driven confrontation, and to push reasonable, practical and constructive dialogue, Zhao said. Unlike the US, which reportedly refuses to engage with Russia at the G20 meeting, China will meet a number of countries' diplomats including those from Australia and Canada - the two countries that have seen deteriorating bilateral relations with China in recent years due to their ill-intentioned policies of coordinating with the US in its China containment strategy. China experts said it also showed a major difference between China and the US in their foreign policies as China always advocates for multilateralism, and high-level engagements like the G20 could help increase understanding, boost consensus and control divergences.  According to a US official familiar with the matter, Antony Blinken also plans to avoid appearing in any official group photos with his Russia counterpart, CNN said. ""China's engagement is clearly focused on stability and joint progress regionally and globally… As a major power, China needs to closely engage with developed countries on economic and security issues, which is necessary to expand consensus,"" the Beijing-based expert said. For instance, China and India have agreed to follow the important common understandings reached by the two leaders and the agreements signed by both sides, and properly resolve issues related to the West sector of the China-India boundary in line with the principle of mutual and equal security, the China Foreign Ministry spokesperson said. ""China and India are each other's important neighbors. The two sides have the will and capability of jointly maintaining peace and tranquility in the China-India border areas,"" he said. G20 is not G7, so the US won't be able to achieve its goal of isolating Russia, some experts said. They noted that the majority of countries participating in the event are much more concerned about concrete issues such as the food crisis and economic recovery rather than taking sides between the US-led West and Russia. ""With countries like India and Australia, China is willing to discuss cooperation rather than confrontation. Given the severe challenges the global economy is facing today, more confrontation will only make disasters pile up one after another,"" Yang said.",CHINA,DIPLOMACY,State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi,"Reporter, Beijing","Chen Qingqing co-leads the Global Times China desk.

238,Title not found,Global Times,2022-07-08,"The UK and the US have recently been overwhelmed by waves of political turmoil, and various negative events in political circles have been frequently reported. The event that has grabbed the most attention is UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Thursday agreeing to resign after a wave of staffers quit their posts. The no-confidence vote among Conservatives in early June suggested that Boris Johnson has become very unpopular in his own party. Resignations from more than 50 ministers in recent days indicate he has become utterly isolated. ""Another important trigger is his poor performance in diplomacy, especially the increasingly tense UK-EU relations, and improper handling of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, which has resulted in soaring inflation. Complaints about Boris Johnson among ordinary UK can be heard everywhere. His internal and external difficulties are the fundamental cause of his decision to resign,"" said Song Zhongping, a China military expert and TV commentator.In the US, UK's closest ally, some politicians are still focusing on the 2020 election results. A grand jury investigation into Donald Trump's efforts to overturn the 2020 election in Georgia is still ongoing. The Republican Party of Texas in June adopted a resolution that rejects President Joe Biden as the winner of the 2020 election. The direct trigger of the current political chaos in UK and the US is the incompetence of its elected leaders, which has drawn widespread criticism from the public and officials. But their plight cannot be addressed by changing their leaders, as the root of the mess is structural. On a global scale, a rising East and falling West has been an unstoppable trend. The West represented by the UK and the US is indeed on the decline, and the decline in quality of their leaders is just a manifestation of this. Furthermore, their so-called democratic political system also plays a big role in creating the political chaos both countries are seeing. ""The primary problem in their system is political parties taking turns in power. In this system, the relations between the parties are not cooperative, but cut-throat,"" Song said, ""In many internal and domestic affairs, the parties even set traps for each other, resulting in these affairs ending in a mess and becoming unresolvable."" Once elected, the ruling party tends to break promises they made to voters during election campaigns. As an inevitable consequence, the public in the UK and US have lost confidence in their leaders.Democracy in itself is a good thing. It is one of the universal core values and principles for all human beings. But the democracy of the UK and the US is a bad thing. Their democratic practice is a mess, resulting in democracy being marred beyond recognition. The US vigorously promotes itself as a ""beacon of democracy,"" an example worthy of emulation by other countries. This is just a narrative US has fabricated to consolidate its hegemony and leadership across the world, which is being proved to be increasingly absurd through its own practice. US and UK policymakers have failed to focus their energy and resources to fix problems at home and meet the needs of their own people, but have been busy creating disputes, chaos and crises abroad to divert attention away from them. This, once again, demonstrates how terrible their democratic practices are, and has resulted in the emergence of irresponsible political lunatics. This practice of extending their political lives through shifting crises has only resulted in an endless accumulation of domestic problems, which in turn harms themselves. The democracy in the US and the UK is a joke. It is an inefficient, fake democracy that consumes national resources. Democratic practices in the US and the UK have tarnished the name of democracy and disappointed people's expectations of it. It is democratic practice filled with confusion and risk.",OPINION,OBSERVER,"US President Joe Biden and Britain's Prime Minister Boris Johnson shake hands ahead of a meeting of The North Atlantic Council during the NATO summit in Madrid on June 30, 2022.

240,PLA holds joint drills around Taiwan over US senator visit: Chinese military,Liu Xuanzun,2022-07-08," The China People's Liberation Army (PLA) conducted large-scale drills around Taiwan in response to a US senator's recent visit to the island, both the China military and the Foreign Ministry announced on Friday, while the Taiwan Affairs Office expressed opposition to the US' interfering with the Taiwan question. Analysts urged the US to stop making provocations by using the question of the island of Taiwan, since such moves do not fit the shared purposes of the two militaries to avoid escalating disputes into clashes or confrontations. Recently, the PLA Eastern Theater Command organized cross-service joint alert patrol and realistic combat-scenario exercises in maritime and aerial spaces around the Taiwan Straits, Senior Colonel Shi Yi, a spokesperson from the PLA Eastern Theater Command, said in a statement on Friday.The US has been making repeated moves over the Taiwan question and sending support to the ""Taiwan independence"" secessionist forces, which is a completely futile move that can only disrupt peace and escalate tensions in the Taiwan Straits, Shi said.Taiwan is a part of China, Shi stressed. The troops of the PLA Eastern Theater Command are on high alert at all times and will continuously enhance combat preparedness through intensified training to firmly safeguard national sovereignty, security as well as peace and stability in the region, and resolutely crush any ""Taiwan independence"" attempts, he said.A delegation headed by US Senator Rick Scott arrived in Taiwan on Thursday, as the group is scheduled to meet Taiwan regional leader Tsai Ing-wen among oth-er Taiwan authority leaders during their visit which will last until Saturday, media on the island reported on Thursday.The US move seriously violates the one-China principle and regulations in the China-US three joint communiques, badly damages the political basis of China-US relations, severely sabotages China-US ties and mil-to-mil ties, and caused escalations to tensions in the Taiwan Straits, said Senior Colonel Wu Weishan Qian, a spokesperson at China's Ministry of National Defense, in a statement on Friday. ""China resolutely opposes this.""In response to this vile act of provocative US-Taiwan collusion, the PLA Eastern Theater Command recently organized cross-service joint alert patrol and realistic combat-scenario exercises in maritime and aerial spaces around the Taiwan Straits, Wu Weishan said, noting that the Taiwan question is purely one of China internal affairs. The reunification of China is bound to happen, and foreign interference forces will in no way succeed.The PLA is ready for combat all times, and will take any necessary measures to resolutely thwart foreign interference and ""Taiwan independence"" secessionist attempts in order to firmly safeguard national sovereignty and territorial integrity, Wu Weishan said.

Photo: IC On the same day, Zhao Lijian, a spokesperson of China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, told the press conference that the PLA Eastern Theater Command's patrols and drills around Taiwan target external interference and ""Taiwan independence"" secessionist forces.Zhao noted that China will firmly safeguard national sovereignty, security and territorial integrity, and resolutely crush any ""Taiwan independence"" attempts.On Friday, Taiwan Affairs Office spokesperson Zhu Fenglian also expressed opposition to the US delegation's visit to the island of Taiwan and said that it is dangerous behavior to indulge the secessionists in the island. The Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)'s attempt to ""draw outside anti-China forces to seek independence for the island is doomed to fail."" Recently, the US has intensified efforts to hype the question of the island of Taiwan, especially after the Russia-Ukraine conflict, and the US and its allies have also been conducting frequent close-in reconnaissance close to China's territorial waters, which have increased air and maritime tensions and added to the risk of regional clashes, analysts said.In response, Senior Colonel Tan Kefei, another spokesperson of the Ministry of National Defense, told a press conference on June 30 that the PLA will take countermeasures against every provocation and those who come without invita-tion will bear the consequences. Some military experts reached by the Global Times said that the two militaries are in a crucial period and need to have more communication to avoid miscalculations, which is why after China State Councilor and Defense Minister Wei Fenghe had his first face-to-face meeting with US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin in Singapore on June 10, Chief of the Central Military Commission (CMC) Joint Staff Department, General Li Zuocheng, spoke on Thursday night with US General Mark Milley, Chairman of the Joint Chief of Staff on Thursday. During the meeting, Li urged the US to abide by the one-China principle and the provisions of the three joint communiqués, stop turning the clock back on histo-ry and stop the military collusion between the US and the island of Taiwan to avoid undermining China-US relations and stability across the Taiwan Straits. Li also noted that the China military will resolutely safeguard national sovereignty and territorial integrity.A military expert, who asked for anonymity, told the Global Times that the US is more worried that a frontline standoff will lead to unexpected clashes and escalated incidents. It wants to further know about China's bottom line and the PLA's deployments on the frontline, and improving practical communications will decrease miscalculations. The last talks between Li and Milley took place 18 months ago on January 8, 2021. Before Wei and Austin's meeting in Singapore, they talked via phone on April 20, while the talks before the April one took place in August 2020. Experts said that after Wei and Austin's first phone conversation in April, the two militaries have been engaged in more frequent communications, and maintaining engagement is better than not talking to each other. The intensified interactions are meaningful for the two militaries to avoid escalating disputes to clashes or confrontations, and the bilateral relations between China and the US are significant to regional and world stability.  Although improving talks and avoiding clashes and confrontations fit the interests of China and the US, the latter will not give up its strategy of seeing China as its most important strategic competitor and major challenge, experts said, warning that further provocations to hollow out the one-China policy will undermine the trust between the two militaries and damage bilateral relations.",CHINA,MILITARY,"Two Su-35 fighter jets and a H-6K bomber fly in formation on May 11, 2018.

241,"China lauds resilient ties with Russia at FMs' meeting, calls for de-escalating Ukraine situation",Global Times-Xinhua,2022-07-08," China and Russia overcame obstacles, maintained normal exchanges and pushed forward cooperation in various fields in an orderly manner, showing the strong resilience and strategic determination in bilateral ties amid emerging global challenges, China State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi said during a meeting with Russia Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov on the sidelines of the Group of 20 (G20) foreign ministers' meeting in Bali, Indonesia, on Thursday. Wang said it is the shared aspiration of developing countries to oppose hegemony, bullying and unilateralism.Facing the realities of the current international politics, will countries choose to pursue power politics and hegemony, or promote a multi-polar world? Wang asked. Will they truly uphold the international order with the UN at its core or follow rules made by a handful of countries according to their own standards? Wang said he believes more and more countries will have a clearer view of this and make the right choice as time goes by.Lavrov said Russia and China have played an important role in safeguarding the UN Charter and international law, promoting a fairer international order and pushing for more democratic international relations by upholding responsible stances and maintaining strategic collaboration, which is recognized and supported by developing countries.The Russia-China relations are not subject to external interference and the practical cooperation between the two countries is advancing smoothly with a great potential for further development, Lavrov said. Russia is ready to expand the area and scale of cooperation between the two countries, so as to better benefit the two peoples, he said. The two sides discussed the Ukraine situation. Wang said China will continue holding an objective and just position, focusing on de-escalating the situation and promoting peace talks, and supporting all efforts conducive to the peaceful settlement of the crisis.China stands ready to work with all sides to implement the China-proposed Global Security Initiative and practice the vision of common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security, Wang said.Wang said China is ready to work with other BRICS members, including Russia, to implement the major results achieved at the summit and speed up the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, so as to safeguard the common interests of developing countries, and uphold international equality and justice.Both sides agreed to support Indonesia in successfully hosting the G20 foreign ministers' meeting, and also strengthen cooperation within the framework of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization.Wang was scheduled to attend the G20 foreign ministers' meeting on Thursday and Friday.

242,"Frequent China-US high-level meetings show consensus for avoiding escalating tension, while US is urged to honor its words",Liu Xin,2022-07-08,"A sequence of frequent interactions between senior officials from China and the US since June, including a scheduled meeting between China State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi and US Secretary of State Antony Blinken in Bali on Saturday, have underscored the two sides' consensus on avoiding escalating confrontations, and may help create better atmosphere for a potential top leaders' meeting, analysts have claimed, urging the US to take more concrete actions, rather than just lip service, to reduce twists and turns impacting bilateral relations. As agreed by China and the US, Wang will meet with Antony Blinken on the sidelines of the G20 meeting on current China-US relations and major international and regional issues, China Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said on Tuesday. Two days before Wang and Antony Blinken's meeting, Chief of the Central Military Commission (CMC) Joint Staff Department, General Li Zuocheng, spoke on Thursday night with US General Mark Milley, Chairman of the Joint Chief of Staff, at the latter's invitation.The recent interactions between senior officials from China and the US have been made to implement the consensus reached by the top leaders on March 18 and to set guardrails for the bilateral relationship given increasing frictions, Yang Xiyu, a senior research fellow at the China Institute of International Studies, told the Global Times.Talks between high-level officials from China and the US in many fields will also help create a good atmosphere for a top leaders' meeting, analysts said, noting that US President Joe Biden was cited by media in June as saying that he would plan to talk with President Xi Jinping, while no information has been released from the China side.Previously, on March 18, China President Xi Jinping held a video call with Joe Biden at the request of the latter during which the top leaders directed their team to follow up and take concrete actions to put China-US relations back on the track of steady development, the Xinhua News Agency reported. There have been frequent interactions between senior officials of China and the US over the last two months. On military affairs, aside from the Thursday meeting between Li and Milley, on June 10, China State Councilor and Defense Minister Wei Fenghe had his first face-to-face meeting with US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin. Later on June 13, Yang Jiechi, a member of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee, met with US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan in Luxembourg. And on July 5, China Vice Premier Liu He, also a member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and chief of the China side of the China-US comprehensive economic dialogue, held a video conversation with US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen at the latter's request, according to Xinhua. Implementing the consensus reached by top leaders of China and the US has been mentioned during the four meetings of senior officials, according to the releases from the China side. The exchanges on military, trade and diplomatic topics aim to avoid China-US relations falling into destructive and strategic confrontations - this is also the shared need and a bottom line, Yang stated.Yang noted that the series of exchanges also sent a strong signal that although the problems between China and the US are very complicated and acute, the two sides still have the willingness to control disputes and take actions to improve communications across many fields. However, analysts also pointed out that the frequent meetings and frequently mentioned topics show the current tense situation facing bilateral relations and in which fields the main disputes exist. By reviewing the readouts and releases of the previous four meetings, the Global Times found that questions of the island of Taiwan and the Ukraine crisis had been mentioned repeatedly especially during meetings between military officials. Many military experts reached by the Global Times said that after the Russia-Ukraine crisis, the US has ramped up efforts in hyping the Taiwan question and the US and its allies have been conducting frequent close-in reconnaissance operations close to China's territorial waters, which have increased the risk of clashes across the Straits and in the region. ""The US is worried that a frontline standoff may cause an unexpected clash and lead to escalating confrontations. By increasing high-level talks of the two militaries, the US hopes to know China's bottom line and the information about the China military,"" one anonymous military expert said. China-US relations are at a very crucial period and it is better to have more communication than blocking voices from each other especially at a military level. Both Wei and Li had reiterated China's stance on the question of the island of Taiwan, which will remind the US about China's redline, military experts said. The questions of the island of Taiwan as well as the Ukraine crisis will also be topics for Wang and Antony Blinken's meeting on Saturday. To maintain communications on such thorny and complicated issues is the main purpose of the meeting, Yang Xiyu said.According to the releases on the previous four meetings from the China side, China officials have mentioned Joe Biden's remarks from two separate meetings that the US does not seek a new Cold War or aim to change China's system, nor will it oppose China through strengthening alliances, support ""Taiwan independence"" or intend to seek a conflict with China, which analysts said showed China attaches great importance to these statements and urges the US to fulfill its promises. Lü Xiang, a research fellow at the China Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times that he had predicted such frequent high-level interactions to happen in the last quarter of 2021. But the US may have postponed the plan to firstly take action against Russia with the purpose of gaining leverage when talking with China. However, the US' previous plan to bring down Russia quickly, which in itself was naïve, has failed and under the current situation, it has to be engaged in a string of talks with China, Lü told the Global Times.China has always welcomed exchanges with the US at all levels but also hoped the US could take concrete actions to promote bilateral relations and decrease twists and turns, instead of only repeating its rhetoric, said Lü.The expert noted that it seems that many US officials - who supposedly should play an important role in the government, have been marginalized, including Yellen. The chaos within the US government is not normal and Joe Biden is relying on people from a very small circle, which may lead to an intentionally unpredictable situation. Lü noted that he is not that optimistic about the meeting between Wang and Antony Blinken. The accumulated problems between China and the US cannot be all solved within one meeting and the recent interactions as well as Wang and Antony Blinken's upcoming meeting on Saturday all aim to stabilize the situation for bilateral relations, Yang said. ""Whether the bilateral relations between two major powers are good or bad is important, but a more important thing is to see whether their relations are mature,"" said Yang. The most urgent issue is to turn China-US relations into a mature exchange - how to avoid destroying bilateral relations due to specific events is a test of each side's wisdom as well as of their sense of responsibility, Yang said.",CHINA,DIPLOMACY,China US Photo: VCG,"Reporter, Beijing","Liu Xin co-leads the Global Times China desk.

243,China-Philippines ties usher in ‘golden era’: FM,GT staff reporters,2022-07-06," During his visit to the Philippines, China State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi hailed China and the Philippines would usher in a ""golden era"" of ties as China is willing to deepen cooperation with the Philippines in various fields. Experts said that after the past six years of nurturing and improving ties, the friendship between the two countries is now at a new high, where they are ready to explore the huge potential of collaboration.Against the backdrop of the US trying hard to push Southeast Asia countries to encircle China, China observers are confident the new Philippines government has the wisdom to know what is best for the country and will avoid taking sides between China and the US. They believe a prospering China-Philippines relationship creates a peaceful and beneficiary atmosphere for cooperation between China and all ASEAN members, to offset the negative impact brought along by US isolationism and COVID-19. Philippines President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. tweeted on Wednesday after meeting with Wang that ""I am grateful to Minister Wang Yi for extending the message of congratulations and support from President Xi Jinping. We also discussed agriculture, infrastructure, energy, and our commitment to maintaining the strong relationship between our peoples in the coming years.""When meeting with Wang, Marcos, Jr. said that the Philippines upholds independent diplomacy, and stick to one-China principle. China is not only neighbor of the Philippines, but also friends and partners, the friendly relations between the two countries should be strengthened, said the Philippines President. ""China Sea is not the mainstream of bilateral relation, and should not stand in the way of bilateral relation,"" he said. Wang said that the bilateral relation is at a new start, and China is willing to be a good neighbor and partner of Philippines, and elevate bilateral cooperation and start a ""golden era"" of bilateral relations. Wang also met with Philippine's Vice President Sara Duterte, Foreign Secretary Enrique Manalo, and National Security Adviser Clarita Carlos. When meeting with Philippine National Security Adviser Clarita Carlos, Wang said that with joint efforts from the two sides, the China-Phillipines relations have witnessed positive turnaround, improvement and upgrading over the past six years.The election of Ferdinand Romualdez Marcos as the new Philippine president has turned over a new leaf in the China-Philippines ties as the people of the two countries have a high expectation on the future development of bilateral relations, he noted.Wang Yi is the first foreign minister to be received by the new Philippine government. Last week, China Vice President Wang Qishan, serving as Xi Jinping's special representative, attended the inauguration of Marcos Jr. as the 17th president of the Philippines.Relations between the two countries are turning a new page, and this means China and the Philippines are going to have upgraded partnership and explore wider and deeper cooperation in areas such as the economy, trade, investment and other areas, Chen Xiangmiao, an assistant research fellow at the National Institute for China Sea Studies, told the Global Times on Wednesday.After hitting bumpy road under the rein of former President Benigno Aquino III, China-Philippines relations revived and prospered under the administration of former Philippine president Rodrigo Duterte, said Chen, believing that after those years' nurturing, the relationship is ready to be upgraded to a new level. At a news briefing on Tuesday, Marcos Jr. said that he wants his country's relationship with China to go beyond disputes over parts of the China. ""Let's add to that. Let's have cultural exchanges, educational exchanges and even military, if that will be useful. In the private sector, joint ventures have also been there. The more we do that, the more it will help resolve the issue,"" he said at the press briefing.China Ambassador to the Philippines Huang Xilian said on Facebook on Tuesday there is another milestone for  Philippine-China G2G cooperation as China and the Philippines signed the commercial contract of the Consulting Services for the Conduct of Detailed Engineering Design and Construction Supervision of the Davao River Bridge. The China Aid Localized Project for Davao River Bridge (Bucana Bridge), located at the estuary of the Davao River in Davao city, is a dual two-lane bridge with a length of around 1,340 meters. When completed, it will alleviate east-West traffic congestion in the coastal areas of the city and divert about 35,000 vehicles every day, improve travel efficiency and help boost the rapid development of the local economy. It is estimated that 300 to 500 local people will be employed during the peak construction period.In fact, China's investment in the Philippines is concentrated on infrastructure projects, which means there is huge potential for future opportunities in areas such as agriculture and healthcare, said Chen, noting that since the two sides already have put disputes surrounding the China Sea under better control, it is also possible for Beijing and Manila to negotiate on oil and gas exploitation and fisheries.When talking about military cooperation, Chen said that although the Philippines is a strong ally of the US in Southeast Asia, it does not deter it from conducting military cooperation with China. US military collaboration with the Philippines is mostly in traditional areas, while China's cooperation with the country is in non-traditional fields, said Chen. Beijing and Manila's cooperation on security focuses mainly on safeguarding maritime security, yet in the future, Chen said the two countries could work together to crackdown on drug-related crimes, trafficking and combat with regional extremist forces. In 2017, China handed over batches of armaments, including rifles, ammunition and sniper scopes to help the Philippines fight terrorism.A broader significance US President Joe Biden extended an invitation for Marcos Jr. to visit the US less than a week after the latter's inauguration, , the Philippines News Agency reported on Sunday.Experts see Joe Biden's move as a way to win over its important ally as the Joe Biden administration has hastened the pace of grouping with other Asia-Pacific countries to contain China. On the other hand, the US is also on edge to see where the new Philippines government stands on its relations with China and with the US.Around the time Marcos Jr. took office, US media published a slew of articles focusing on what stance the Philippines' new president will take when being placed in the middle of the contest between Beijing and US. In an article published on Wednesday, Associated Press said that Marcos Jr.'s Tuesday remarks were playing a ""balancing act.""Experts are confident the Philippines' new government has the wisdom to make choices that would turn out to be the best for the country. Marcos' top priority is to boost the domestic economy and improve people's livelihoods. He will not randomly take sides between China and the US but will take a stance which can best serve Philippine's national interests and promote industrialization and modernization, Xu Liping, a research fellow on Southeast Asia studies at the China Academy of Social Sciences in Beijing, told the Global Times on Wednesday. The Philippines, as well as other ASEAN members, is facing multiple challenges brought about by COVID-19 pandemic, the Russia-Ukraine crisis and the US-led West anti-Russia sanctions, which have deeply interrupted global supply chains, markets and the economic order, said experts.The US is trying to further its influence in the Asia-Pacific region by instigating conflicts and tensions, as US wants to engage in a great power competition against Beijing and has attempted, by using its regional allies, to instigate bloc-to-bloc confrontation in the region. So ASEAN, which prioritizes economic development, is now facing serious challenges and desperately needs the certainty, confidence and protection for the members' economies. This will ensure that China-ASEAN ties are even closer because both parties share a consensus over development and multilateralism, and the region has strong confidence in China's development and clear understanding of China's national strength, analysts said. ASEAN remains China's largest trade partner, accounting for 14.6 percent of China's total foreign trade in the first four months of 2022, with the EU and the US ranking second and third, according to customs statistics released in May, the latest data available.""Stable and positive China-Philippines relations also inject momentum to development of relations between China and all other ASEAN members. The two countries' contribution to regional integration, cooperation in various fields and maritime stability creates a peaceful and beneficiary atmosphere for the whole region,"" Chen said.",CHINA,DIPLOMACY,china philippines,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'Philippines': ('LOC', 11), 'China': ('LOC', 13), 'US': ('LOC', 2), 'Southeast Asia': ('LOC', 1), 'USD': ('LOC', 1), 'China Sea': ('LOC', 14), 'Wang Yi': ('PER', 8), 'Ferdinand Marcos Jr': ('PER', 3), 'Xi Jinping': ('PER', 1), 'Sara Du': ('PER', 1), 'Enrique Manalo': ('PER', 1), 'Ad': ('PER', 2), 'Cita Carlos': ('PER', 2), 'Phillip': ('PER', 1), 'Ferdinanddez Marcos': ('PER', 2), 'ASEAN': ('ORG', 1), 'one': ('MISC', 1), 'Philippine': ('MISC', 3)}"
244,Germany’s trade deficit lays bare its manufacturing malaise,Wang Yi,2022-07-06,"Germany's trade balance was pushed into deficit as exports fall in May, data from Federal Statistical Office of Germany (Destatis) showed. Germany's political and business leaders warned that the country was facing its ""biggest economic crisis for decades,"" according to the Financial Times.When reporting on the current challenges facing Germany's economy and trade, some West media outlets have chosen to shift blame to the Russia-Ukraine conflict or China's battle with Omicron. Deutsche Welle claimed that China's strict epidemic prevention measures had led to production and logistics interruptions, which have had a direct impact on Germany-China trade.Although the surge in energy prices caused by the West sanctions against Russia and the impact of the epidemic on the global supply chain may indeed have some impacts on Germany's economy and trade, it is untenable to attribute the current difficulties to external causes and accuse China. The main reason for Germany's trade imbalance is rooted in the problems within its own economy. Last month, Germany's BDI industry association reduced its forecast for Germany economy in 2022 to 1.5 percent and warned recession risks, Reuters reported. Industry insiders have also recently warned exports downturn especially for auto, machinery and technology sectors. For a long time, while many West countries suffered industrial hollowing out to varying degrees, Germany's stress on industrial strength and manufacturing is undoubtedly successful. However, the problem with ""Made in Germany"" is that the country relies too much on traditional industries such as machinery, automobiles, and chemical industries, and lacks rapid adjustment to the shift of the world economy's industrial focus in the age of digital economy.For example, Germany lags behind the US, China, Japan and South Korea to a certain extent in the combination of traditional manufacturing and the emerging internet sector. It also lags behind China in cutting-edge technologies such as 5G. Although Germany automakers maintain strong competitiveness, they lag behind Tesla in terms of industrial chain construction and technology development in the field of new energy vehicles.In comparison, although China's manufacturing industry also faces many problems, it is now in a critical period of transformation and upgrading. Taking the automobile industry as an example, some forecast China's automobile exports may exceed Germany this year to become the second largest auto exporter of the world. A rapid recovery in China manufacturing shows that ""Made in China"" will not be affected by West badmouthing.For the Germany economy, the tough time may have just begun, and due to energy shortages, Germany exports will likely be hit even harder. To avoid a recession and to avoid further damage to the ""Made in Germany"" image, the nation needs to take practical measures to solve the problems encountered by the manufacturing industry, and make greater efforts to upgrade the industry and promote trade.The author is an editor with the Global Times. bizopinion@globaltimes.com.cn",SOURCE,ECONOMY,Illustration: Chen Xia/Global Times,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'Germany': ('LOC', 13), 'Russia': ('LOC', 2), 'Ukraine': ('LOC', 1), 'China': ('LOC', 10), 'US': ('LOC', 1), 'Japan': ('LOC', 1), 'South Korea': ('LOC', 1), 'Federal Statistical Office of Germany': ('ORG', 1), 'Destatis': ('ORG', 1), 'Financial Times': ('ORG', 1), 'Omicron': ('ORG', 1), 'Deutsche Welle': ('ORG', 1), 'B': ('ORG', 1), 'Reuters': ('ORG', 1), 'West': ('MISC', 4), 'Made in Germany': ('MISC', 1)}"
245,Financial firms eye yuan payment channel for India-Russia trade: insider,Yin Yeping,2022-07-07,"Some financial institutions in India plan to come up with a payment channel that enables direct settlements in China yuan for India's trade with Russia, as trade between the two countries, especially in energy goods, has jumped significantly in recent months, according to a financial sector insider on Wednesday. ""Several financial institutions in India are working on plans to see whether direct cross-border yuan transactions between India and Russia companies can be realized,"" the insider from a financial institution told the Global Times on condition of anonymity, predicting a possible explosive growth for the use of yuan and trade in the short term, if the yuan can be directly used as a currency for transactions between India and Russia.However, as direct transactions in yuan between India and Russia companies have not been available before, a new channel needs to be found, the person said.India's biggest cement producer, UltraTech Cement, reportedly paid in China yuan for a cargo of coal from Russia producer SUEK, Reuters reported on June 29. The cargo's sale was arranged by SUEK's Dubai-based unit, the report said.The move, industry analysts said, signals the possible trend for the yuan to become an increasingly popular and reliable alternative to the US dollar, which has been increasingly weaponized by US.The insider at a banking institution said that what they are working on is something new - direct transactions in yuan between India and Russia companies without going through any third party or countries, which can be more effective.According to a report by the Center for Energy and Clean Air Research, after the Russia-Ukraine conflict, India's crude oil imports from Russia increased from about 1 percent to 18 percent.There are no technical problems with yuan settlements in cross-border trade between Russia and India, and this is conducive not only to the internationalization of the yuan but also to the sustainability and smoothness of trade, as a possible means of avoiding risks for enterprises, at a time when the US government is apt to wield its dollar hegemony as a stick to put sanctions on others for political purposes, Dong Dengxin, director of the Finance and Securities Institute of the Wuhan University of Science and Technology, told the Global Times on Wednesday.The US dollar is the monopoly currency of the entire international settlement system, allowing the US to freeze the assets of enterprises at any time, experts said.""China, Russia and other countries must find ways to avoid risks, while coming up with more convenient and efficient payment methods such as the yuan to secure the supply chain and trade,"" Dong said.",SOURCE,ECONOMY,Renminbi Photo: VCG,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'India': ('LOC', 10), 'China': ('LOC', 3), 'Russia': ('LOC', 10), 'US': ('LOC', 5), 'Ukraine': ('LOC', 1), 'Global Times': ('ORG', 1), 'UltraTech Cement': ('ORG', 1), 'SUEK': ('ORG', 2), 'Reuters': ('ORG', 1), 'Center for Energy and Clean Air Research': ('ORG', 1), 'Dubai': ('MISC', 1)}"
246,US to push Ukraine agenda but ‘G20 FMs not to be misled’,Chen Qingqing,2022-07-07,"While the Ukraine crisis is anticipated to top the agenda during the upcoming G20 (Group of 20) foreign ministers' meeting to be held from Thursday to Friday, the US plans to pressure many of the world's largest economies to take a tougher stance toward Russia and China while these largest economies are supposed to discuss economic issues. China observers have stated that the G20 is not an exclusive club which belongs to the West, and it would be "" daydreaming"" for the US to seek to turn this occasion into an anti-Russia and anti-China platform — unlike the G7, the G20 represents emerging powers that seek solutions to challenges such as economic turbulence and food crisis rather than divide the world by creating more geopolitical conflicts. Foreign ministers from the G20, including West countries that strongly oppose Russia's military operations in Ukraine as well as emerging economies such as India and Indonesia which have been restrained in condemning Russia, are scheduled to meet Thursday. It will be the first time that foreign ministers from these countries have met Russia Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov since Russia's military operations started in February, Reuters reported on Wednesday. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken will call on the G20 countries to increase pressure on Russia, calling for the efforts in reopening ""sea lanes blocked by the Ukraine conflict"" and repeating warnings to China to not support Russia during the crisis, according to the Reuters report. Some US allies, including Germany and Japan, echoed these intentions. Germany foreign ministry spokesperson Christian Wagner was quoted as saying that the upcoming meeting would not be a ""normal summit"" or ""business as usual."" Germany will coordinate in Bali over how to respond to Lavrov in light of the Ukraine crisis, said Wagner, Reuters reported. Japan Foreign Minister Hayashi Yoshimasa said ahead of the meeting that Japan will work with relevant countries to earnestly uphold Japan's position on Russia's operations in Ukraine, which has ""shaken the foundation of the international order,"" Kyodo News said on Tuesday. When asked about whether Yoshimasa would walk out if Russia representative delivers a speech at the meeting, as officials from UK, Canada and the US previously did so during a G20 finance ministers' meeting in US in April, Yoshimasa said he would ""respond properly"" when Lavrov speaks, according to Japan media. But China experts predicted it is impossible to form a unified anti-Russia or anti-China alliance at the G20, as many countries do not share a similar stance to the US-led West bloc, and they expect the Ukraine crisis could be solved through diplomatic consultation rather than exerting pressure which creates more conflicts. 'Not a club of the West' The US intends to make the G20 another chance to diplomatically target Russia and it will not forfeit any chance to do so at such multilateral gatherings, be it political or economic. US foreign policy is characterized by putting US interests above all, Yang Xiyu, a senior research fellow at the China Institute of International Studies, told the Global Times on Wednesday. ""But the G20 is neither an exclusive club of the West nor a platform possessed by the US. A majority of countries across the world did not join the West-led sanctions against Russia, and the G20 is composed of many developing countries that don't dance to the US' tune,"" Yang said. Nearly one-third of the world's population live in a country that has remained neutral on the Russia-Ukraine conflict, represented by India. These non-aligned states also include Brazil, Saudi Arabia, South Africa and the UAE, which will do their utmost to avoid taking sides while seeking to benefit from their neutrality, according to an analysis of Economist Intelligence Unit. Indonesian President Joko Widodo met with Russia President Vladimir Putin in Moscow on June 30, and some media reports suggest Indonesia's reluctance to exclude Vladimir Putin from the G20 summit in November showed that it does not want to be seen as taking sides and it hopes to concentrate on this year's meeting which will focus on a global post-COVID-19 economic recovery.Lü Xiang, a research fellow from the China Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times on Wednesday it is not so much the Russia-Ukraine conflict that has caused the worldwide economic crisis, but rather it is the numerous sanctions jointly imposed by the US-led West that have caused chaos across the global supply chain and aggravated an emerging global economic crisis.If the US uses the G20 as a venue to attack Russia, it will only complicate the situation and do no help resolve its domestic issues, the expert said. ""West countries' economic predicament and other domestic problems cannot be solved by expanding or intensifying the geopolitical tension,"" he noted. China experts have suggested it may be difficult to achieve any consensus at the upcoming G20 foreign ministers' meeting and they warned that an anti-Russia alliance would not play out as the West desired. ""Russia is one of the few countries that can build a fortress economy through balancing internal demand and supply, and West intentions to bring Russia down by the use of economic sanctions will only hurt themselves,"" Lü said. Urgent economic issues Launched in 1999 as a meeting of finance ministers and central bank governors, the G20 evolved into a yearly summit involving the heads of state and government alongside other meetings throughout the year. It's a strategic multilateral platform connecting the world's major developed and emerging economies, holding a strategic role in securing future global economic growth and prosperity, as its website showed. ""As one of the most important and legitimate platforms for the global economic governance, the G20 also coordinates with other multilateral platforms like the BRICS, making future global governance fairer and more sustainable,"" Wang Yiwei, director of the Institute of International Affairs at Renmin University of China, told the Global Times on Wednesday. Against the backdrop of US-led containment of China and Russia, the two countries are coordinating closely. During a meeting between Vice Foreign Minister Ma Zhaoxu and Russia Ambassador to China Andrey Ivanovich Denisov on Tuesday, Ma said under the guidance of top leaders of the two countries, China-Russia relations continue to grow. China is ready to strengthen strategic coordination with Russia, expand practical cooperation across the board, and deepen cooperation within multilateral frameworks such as the UN, the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, BRICS and the G20, and steer the global governance system toward greater impartiality and equity.  Food and energy security will figure prominently at the G20 foreign ministers' meeting, and a senior US official claimed Russia should be held accountable for these issues. The US official also said there will be a ""candid"" exchange on Ukraine when Antony Blinken meets China's State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi on the G20 sidelines, according to media reports.Yang Xiyu from China Institute of International Studies said, ""If the US really wants to solve the food issue, it should first look into how to deal with the problem itself rather than how to contain Russia,"" as only when officials stop blaming each other can there be opportunity for a joint action in facing up to the crisis.",CHINA,DIPLOMACY,"Motorcyclists ride past a banner for the G20 Foreign Ministerial Meeting scheduled to be held on July 7-8, outside the meeting venue in Bali, Indonesia on July 5, 2022.

China imported 171 million tons of crude oil in the first four months of the year, down 4.8 percent, latest official data showed. Photo: VCGChina's Ministry of Commerce has allocated a new 5 million ton oil product export quota, bringing the total refined fuel export quota so far this year to 22.5 million tons, down 40.2 percent year-on-year, Jiemian News reported, citing domestic energy product information provider JLC.The report said that the new quota has been granted to seven companies including China National Petroleum Corp, China Petroleum & Chemical Corp (Sinopec) and private enterprise Zhejiang Petroleum & Chemical Co.The decline in China's oil product export is mainly due to constrained global demand amid high international crude oil price and the fallout of prolonged pandemic on economic recovery, Lin Boqiang, director of the China Center for Energy Economics Research at Xiamen University, told the Global Times on Thursday.In addition, China has vowed to reach peak carbon dioxide emissions by 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality by 2060, to achieve which, domestic refiners should follow relevant policies to make transformation, according to Lin.According to data from the General Administration of Customs, China exported a total of 18.45 million tons of refined oil products in the first five months of the year, down 38.5 percent on a yearly basis. However, export value increased 2.3 percent year-on-year.Lin said that China's export of refined fuel products has had only a slight impact on the global economy given its small amount.After hitting a 10-week high at more than $125 per barrel in mid-June, Brent crude futures have ceded ground in volatile trading as concerns over a global economic slowdown trumped the impact of West sanctions on Russia oil supplies, S&P Global reported.As of 10 am Thursday, Brent crude futures slid 1.9 percent to $98.95 per barrel, their closest to $100 per barrel since April 26.

248,G20 will not become an enlarged G7,Andrey Kortunov,2022-07-07,"The G20 Foreign Ministers' Meeting (FMM) is being held in Bali on Thursday and Friday. It is one of the most important events on the way to the G20 summit that the island will host on November 15-16. The official announcement discloses the overarching theme of the meeting - ""Recover Together, Recover Stronger"" - as well as the aim ""to enhance further collaboration through dialogue to revive multilateralism in addressing global challenges.""This year, the FMM takes place under extremely challenging political circumstances resulting from the Russia-Ukraine conflict and, more generally, from Russia-West confrontation climbing to a new, unprecedented level. One cannot envy Russia Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov: He is doomed to get an ice-cold treatment from his West peers who stay firm in their intention to ignore him in Bali. Still, Russia will hardly be fully isolated at the FMM: Lavrov can count on a chain of bilateral consultations with his counterparts from several non-West G20 countries including China, Mexico, South Africa and Brazil, as well as with the invited leaders of some international organizations. However, the FMM intrigue is not limited to Russia's place within G20. The West comes to Bali more united than it has ever been since the end of the Cold War. The recent summits of G7, the North Atlantic Alliance and the EU have demonstrated an exceptionally high degree of the West cohesion. It is clear that the West leaders have done their homework for the FMM and that they will actively try to advance their strategic goals at the meetings in July and in November. Ideally, the West would like to turn G20 into a natural extension of G7, so that the Group of Seven liberal democracies could set the prime agenda for the 20 influential international actors, and through these actors - for an even larger international community. The desired agenda is much broader than the attitude to the Russia-Ukraine standoff, it is also about many other critical international issues, including the post-COVID-19 recovery, multiple regional crises, resource management, climate change, global commons, and so on. If G7 could regain its former role as the rule-maker in global affairs, and if G20 would accept the role of a rule-taker, the world would get back to the unipolar model of the end of 20th century with US at the very top of the decision-making system and with the rest of G7 constituting the second tier of global governance. However, these plans are not likely to work - neither at the forthcoming FMM and certainly not at the November G20 summit. The world today is simply too different from what it was in the end of last century; the balance of power between the West and ""the Rest"" has shifted dramatically in favor of the latter The reality is that G20 has never been and will never become an extended or an enlarged version of G7, despite a significant overlap of membership between the two groups. While G7 is an exclusive club of West democracies (even India has not been invited to formally join the group), G20 is an inclusive and diverse gathering of major global economies. The diverse composition of G20 makes it more difficult to reach consensus within this group than within a more homogeneous G7 or within any other West forum or institution. At the same time, diversity is one of the main sources of G20 legitimacy that G7 or NATO clearly lacks. Diversity and representativeness are assets that the Group of 20 cannot easily relinquish. For instance, though non-West members of G20 have various attitudes toward Russia's special military operation in Ukraine, they fully understand that expelling Moscow from the group or ostracizing Vladimir Putin would set a dangerous precedent within the group that they would like to avoid.  This is exactly why G20 focuses mostly not on divisive and potentially explosive matters of international security, but rather on the unifying agenda of global economy and finance. This is the agenda, with which the group came to the fore of world politics during the global financial crisis of 2008-2009, and these priorities have to be preserved in our difficult times. It is true that today security and development can hardly be separated from each other. However, it is more logical and more productive for G20 to work hand in hand with the UN rather than to try to replace the latter.  G7 might and probably should be an important source of new ideas for G20 on global development, but such an advisory and consultative role may be also claimed by the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, BRICS, APEC and many other similar institutions. For the West it would be better than not to try to impose a partisan G7 approach on a more inclusive G20 forum, but instead to consider mutual adjustments on trade, investments, international assistance, and so on and to attempt reaching a common denominator amid serious disagreements between the West and ""the Rest."" The announced bilateral meeting between China State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi and US Secretary of State Antony Blinken on the margins of the FMM is a positive signal that might reflect a change of views in US on how far the US should go in its confrontation with Beijing, provided that the meeting will not be limited to US trying to convince China to move to the ""right side of history"" and to abandon its strategic partnership with Russia.  The author is a director general of the Russia International Affairs Council. opinion@globaltimes.com.cn",OPINION,COLUMNISTS,Indonesian Foreign Minister Retno Marsudi (right) greets Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi during their bilateral meeting ahead of the G20 Foreign Ministers' Meeting in Nusa Dua on Thursday.

China-EU freight trains, which have been playing a resilient role in sustaining cross-continental trade, are now facing excessive demand, insiders said.Russia freight forwarder Inteco and Swift Transport Group have jointly created liner operating subsidiaries to offer container shipping services between Vostochny in Russia's Far East and port cities in China, a person close to the matter told the Global Times on Thursday, describing it as a response to the rising demand for smooth and safe trade.Industry information platform container-news.com said that the first service covers Vostochny, Lianyungang and Qingdao in China and South Korea's Busan, with a two-week turnaround, while other services, using two general cargo vessels that can each carry 264 TEUs, covers Vostochny and China's Ningbo, but can also pick up cargo at other China ports if needed.More ships or larger charter vessels are being considered to add calls to Shenzhen, the report said.Russia's trade with countries such as China and India have picked up significantly given the high complementarity of their economies. While Russia needs mechanical equipment and other daily commodities from China, Russia energy exports are needed in China and India.Meanwhile, Tommy Tan, president of Shanghai EPU Supply Chain Management Co, an agent for China-EU freight trains, told the Global Times on Thursday that in the context of the surge in China-Russia trade and the suspension of Russia routes by some major international shipping companies, China-EU freight trains have become a supply guarantee channel for transportation.However, the China-EU freight train has reached its ceiling in the face of the booming demand, industry insiders said, an indication of why the chartered container ships are needed.""At present, the capacity of the China-EU trains departing from Jining in Ulanqab [in North China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region], and passing through Russia has peaked, so we have to close the channel for receiving goods from other parts of China in prioritizing the delivery needs of local enterprises,"" an export agent surnamed Li told Global Times on Thursday.Purefine Wood Trade Agency, a Changzhou-based trading company in China's Jiangsu Province, which conducts trade with Russia, told the Global Times that ""it's hard to find a container available these days… and the delivery time via the cargo trains has been extended by an extra week between cities in West Russia and China, given the high demand.""The freight rate of the cross-border cargo train between China and Russia has increased by about 10 percent month-on-month since the Russia-Ukraine conflict started, with raw materials from Russia taking a big part of transportation capacity, Liu noted, adding that he is now looking for ocean container vessels to get around the train problem. Customs offices across the country have ramped up efforts to smooth trade flows via train. For example, Jining Customs, a clearing station and hub for international freight trains in Inner Mongolia, has opened a ""green channel"" for timely inspection and clearance of goods upon arrival 24 hours a day, seven days a week, the Global Times learned from Jining customs.Despite West sanctions against Russia, China's Foreign Ministry has repeatedly stated that China opposes the unilateral sanctions and will continue normal economic and trade cooperation with Russia.",SOURCE,ECONOMY,"Russian freight cars containing timber in Suifenhe, a major Chinese border city with Russia, on September 26, 2018 Photo: IC",Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'Russia': ('LOC', 13), 'India': ('LOC', 3), 'West': ('LOC', 2), 'Vostochny': ('LOC', 3), 'Far East': ('LOC', 1), 'Lianyungang': ('LOC', 1), 'Qingdao': ('LOC', 1), 'South Korea': ('LOC', 1), 'Busan': ('LOC', 1), 'Ningbo': ('LOC', 1), 'Shenzhen': ('LOC', 1), 'U': ('LOC', 1), 'North China': ('LOC', 15), 'Inner Mongolia': ('LOC', 1), 'Region': ('LOC', 1), 'Global Times': ('ORG', 3), 'Maersk': ('ORG', 1), 'EU': ('ORG', 5), 'Inteco': ('ORG', 1), 'Swift Transport Group': ('ORG', 1), 'com': ('ORG', 1), 'Shanghai EPU Supply Chain Management Co': ('ORG', 1), 'Tommy Tan': ('PER', 1)}"
251,"Apollo, Blackstone seek buyers for Canadian oil producer Ridgeback",Reuters,2022-07-07,"Apollo Global Management Inc and the credit arm of Blackstone Group Inc are looking to sell Canada oil and gas producer Ridgeback Resources for more than C$1 billion ($765.58 million), four sources familiar with the matter said on Tuesday.Rising demand and the Ukraine crisis pushed oil prices to multi-year highs in recent months, giving owners of energy assets a window to sell and lock in profits. Global crude benchmark Brent has soared more than 30 percent this year.Two investment banks have been hired to manage the sale of Ridgeback, one of the largest private oil producers in Canada, the sources said. They added no deal for Ridgeback was guaranteed and the company's assets could be sold in multiple transactions.The sources requested anonymity to discuss confidential information. Ridgeback did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Apollo and Blackstone Credit declined to comment.Apollo and Blackstone formed Ridgeback in 2016 to buy bankrupt Canada oil producer Lightstream Resources in a C$1.35 billion deal. The two US buyout firms were among the largest bondholders of Lightstream.The company's assets span over 535,000 net acres (216,500 hectares) in Alberta, Saskatchewan and UK Columbia provinces. Ridgeback forecasts production of 22,619 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd) this year and 24,532 boepd next year, according to a marketing document seen by Reuters.International players have been pulling back from Canada's oil and gas production industry in recent years.Some have left to pursue cheaper, more profitable opportunities in the US and elsewhere: Exxon Mobil Corp and its Canada unit, Imperial Oil Ltd, sold their shale properties in the Montney and Duvernay basins to Whitecap Resources Inc on Tuesday for C$1.9 billion. Others have left due to environmental considerations: Canada oil reserves are among the most carbon-intensive forms of crude production, for example.Both Apollo and Blackstone have been pivoting away from oil and gas in North US to focus on renewables and other clean energy investments.Apollo launched a sustainable investing platform in February which aims to deploy $50 billion in decarbonization and energy transition opportunities over the next five years. Blackstone has also been making numerous green investments and, in the last 18 months, sold US oil and gas producers GeoSouthern and Guidon Operating.Ridgeback is Apollo's largest remaining upstream asset in Canada, while it is Blackstone Credit's only production asset in the country.Reuters",SOURCE,COMPANIES,"Oil wells in a field near Drumheller, Alberta, Canada.

252,‘We dare not forget’: Chinese commemorate 85th anniversary of the July 7 Incident,Fan Anqi and Zhang Changyue,2022-07-07,"From leaving flowers to reciting poems at memorial halls for the deceased, China people are paying tribute in various forms to late national heroes on Thursday on the occasion of the 85th anniversary of the July 7 Incident in 1937, which marked the beginning of the all-out War of Resistance against Japan Aggression (1931-45). A memorial ceremony was held on Thursday morning at the Museum of the War of China People's Resistance Against Japan Aggression in Beijing. Senior Communist Party of China (CPC) official Wang Huning delivered a speech at the event. ""Some 85 years ago, Japan invaders bombarded the city of Wanping [today's Beijing] to achieve their criminal ambition of annexing all of China by force, and carried out the Lugou Bridge Incident which shocked the world. The China people rose up to resist, and became the main battlefield in the east in the world's anti-fascist war,"" Wang, a member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and a member of the Secretariat of the CPC Central Committee, said. ""All China people fought to protect their motherland from tragedy in blood and tears, showing the majestic and indomitable spirit of the China nation,"" Wang noted. The top trending topic on Sina Weibo said ""We dare not forget what happened this same day 85 years ago."" The topic was viewed 730 million times and discussed 3.5 million times as of press time.As Global Times reporters visited the museum at around 1 pm on Thursday as outside temperatures surpassed 35 C, they saw groups of people already queuing up outside, waiting for the 1:30 pm reopening of the museum which had been closed to visitors since May 3 due to COVID-19 epidemic.Luo Cunkang, curator of the museum, told the Global Times on Thursday that there are more than 60 memorial halls across China celebrating the anniversary. ""One cannot learn from history without fully understanding it, and one can only learn the value of peace better when reviewing wartime history, especially under the current complicated international landscape.""""I wish young people will know more about history and learn our martyrs' spirits so they make greater contributions in building our country into a stronger one and making efforts to maintain world peace,"" Luo said.While Luo explained the stories behind each picture and artifact, an 8-year-old child surnamed Gao was seen listening intently to the curator, sticking his head almost into the pictures on the wall. Gao told the Global Times that he came with his father to the museum for the first time on such a special occasion.Although this part of the history is not taught until the third or fourth grade, Gao already learned from the story of his great-grandfather, who was killed in the war. Gao was shocked to see the exhibits. ""Look at the shot holes on the soldier's steel helmet! You can imagine how brave he was,"" Gao told the Global Times. At the Memorial Hall of the Victims in Nanjing Massacre by Japan Invaders, an educational activity was held to commemorate the anniversary. A group of primary school students from Nanjing, China's Jiangsu Province, recited a poem titled ""Monument of the Nation,"" which reads, ""I listened quietly to the sound of a nation clenching its fist; it was a war that chilled the Japan to the bone. The last bullet erupted with fury, into the chest of the enemy.""At such an occasion to reflect on a nation's history, experts noted that today's Japan has not learned from its past but instead, grows even more aggressive in trying to expand its military presence using security threats as pretexts. They warn of a growing right-wing force among the Japan government, in which people see its military past reviving from 85 years ago. China Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian on Thursday urged Japan to effectively face up to its history of aggression, learn a profound lesson and adhere to the path of peaceful development with practical actions.Tokyo has been keen on hyping the Ukraine crisis and ""China threat"" to support and advocate expansion of NATO in the Asia-Pacific. By elaborating on the rhetoric, Japan is aiming to revise its postwar pacifist constitution, which could allow it to get rid of the constraint of the supreme charter, participate in NATO, and seek to develop into a military power, experts said. ""The logic behind a growing right-wing voice in Japan society is that Japan's ruling party is exaggerating so-called security threats to create tensions among the masses, encourage conservative thinking, and fanning hostility toward neighboring countries so they can achieve their ambitions,"" Da Zhigang, director of the Institute of Northeast Asia Studies at Heilongjiang Provincial Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times on Thursday.Such an atmosphere comes from a sense of anxiety from Japan, due to its declining economic competitiveness and pressure in dealing with its neighbors and relations with major world powers, Da said.",CHINA,SOCIETY,"A student looks at historical relics on display at the Museum of the War of Chinese People's Resistance Against Japanese Aggression in Beijing on July 7, 2022, the 85th anniversary of the July 7 Incident in 1937, which marked the beginning of the all-out War of Resistance against Japanese Aggression (1931-45).

253,"US, UK poison perception of China with intelligence chiefs’ cliched accusations",GT staff reporters,2022-07-07,"The US and UK have created yet another wave of hype about so-called China espionage, only this time with a clearer purpose, more ""sensational language"" and the aim of manipulating the West's perception of China, China experts said, after the heads of the FBI and MI5 warned that China's industrial espionage poses a growing threat to West groups, including through special purpose acquisition companies. Given in the UK, where Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced he resigned as the Conservative Party leader and is set to resign as prime minister after a slew of scandals, and in the US, which has witnessed a surge in gun violence and social issues that are tearing society apart, experts said a new form of xenophobic McCarthyism is on the rise in those West countries. This is especially the case in Five Eyes alliance countries, which are experiencing waves of social and economic problems. Heaping domestic pressure on other countries, especially a rising China, and fanning the ""China threat"" theory are all old tricks that they use. In a joint appearance in London, the chiefs of the US and UK intelligence agencies called on companies to be much more vigilant about China.FBI director Christopher Wray said Beijing was using ""elaborate shell games"" to disguise its spying and was even taking advantage of Spacs. ""The China government poses an even more serious threat to West businesses than even many sophisticated businesspeople realize,"" Wray told corporate leaders.MI5 Director General Ken McCallum said that the MI5 had seen a sevenfold increase in China-related investigations since 2018, had doubled its capacity to deal with them over the past three years and would probably double capacity again over the next ""handful of years,"" the Financial Times reported. In response to those remarks, the spokesperson from the China embassy in the UK said on Thursday that ""allegations against China by US and UK intelligence officials are completely groundless and the so-called cases they listed are pure shadow chasing. This is a typical example of a thief crying 'catch thief'. We deplore such a despicable and deceptive trick.""The spokesperson pointed out that US and UK intelligence agencies are notorious for their constant engagement in eavesdropping, theft, infiltration and subversion against other countries. They spread all kinds of lies about China in order to smear China's political system, stoke anti-China and exclusionary sentiment, and divert public attention in order to cover up their own infamous deeds.   Zhao Lijian, spokesperson of China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said at the regular press conference on Thursday that the US intelligence officer's remarks exposed the US' deep-rooted zero sum mentality and ideological prejudice. The US just celebrated its 246th Independence Day, and the country was not at war for only 16 years throughout its 240-plus years of history, which made it known as ""the most warlike nation in the history of the world,"" said Zhao, noting that the US is the biggest threat to world peace and development as it has launched wars everywhere and created conflicts internationally.  The bogus accusation from the two officials of China's so-called espionage problem is not new, Liu Chang, a researcher of US studies at the China Institute of International Studies told the Global Times, noting that such accusations come every few months and each time use more ""sensational language"" than the previous ones.This time, the accusation is more planned and systematic, as it aims to intimidate West companies and also to manipulate the West's perception of this problem, Liu noted. Last month, the Global Times learned from sources that the Five Eyes Alliance is collecting and fabricating evidence that intends to show China is ""infiltrating politically into West countries,"" with the aim of tarnishing China's image around the world.Similarly, a briefing released on Wednesday by the US' National Counterintelligence and Security Centre warned that China exploits the nature of the US federal system to influence local and state leaders. It said that ""The PRC (China) understands US state and local leaders enjoy a degree of independence from US and may seek to use them as proxies to advocate for national US policies Beijing desires.""In response, Zhao said at the Thursday briefing that this is an example of a China idiom that describes somebody who has lost his axe and accuses the neighbor of stealing it. He said the US accusation is full of zero sum mentality and makes something out of thin air. Liu warned that other Five Eyes countries may also follow the UK and the US suit, and exaggerate the ""China threat"" in their own country. ""We've already seen the giant power of mixture of cognitive warfare and psychological warfare after the Russia-Ukraine crisis, thus we should not underestimate the damage by the US in concocting and spreading false information,"" said Liu.Experts said that the hyping of the ""China threat"" and so-called espionage problem will actually backfire, as it deals a huge blow to normal exchanges and cooperation between the two countries and terrifies China scientists and corporations that work in those West countries. In a previous interview with the Global Times, Huang Zhengyu, President of the Committee of 100, a US organization of prominent China US in business, government, academia, healthcare and other fields, said that the ""China Initiative"" launched by former US President Donald Trump aimed at cracking down on China scientists has backfired. According to 2021 research by the Committee of 100 on over 2,000 scientists, including China scientists in the US, many elite scientists are reluctant to apply for federal funding and have decided to stop cooperation with China. Some are even considering leaving the US.McCarthyism out of incompetence Wang Wenbin, professor and executive dean of the Chongyang Institute for Financial Studies at Renmin University of China, said he noticed that whenever the Five Eyes countries are in a hard-pressed situation, such as a battered economy or seeing other countries surpass them, McCarthyism becomes prevalent in their countries so as to heap their domestic pressure onto countries such as China.West countries have been facing a slew of woes lately. In the UK, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has resigned as Conservative leader and will step down as prime minister when a new leader is found, the BBC reported Thursday. Boris Johnson's government has been plagued by a series of scandals, from accusations of his disregard for rules and revelations of illegal lockdown-breaking parties held in Downing Street, to allegations of impropriety and abuse by Conservative lawmakers, media reported. In the US, the past Independence Day was marred by gun violence, protests and widespread despair over a failing country. Even its President Joe Biden has admitted that ""in recent days, there has been reason to think that this country is moving backward, that freedom has been reduced, that rights we assumed were protected are no longer.""Wang said that taking the US as an example, Joe Biden has been competing with his predecessor Donald Trump to create a ""new political correctness, which is to divert public attention by using McCarthyism. And in fact, blaming others for their own problem is an old tactic used by West countries,"" according to Wang. Experts said that those Five Eyes alliance countries, led by US, is creating a chilling terror under which people from those countries are afraid of engaging in exchanges with people from China and vice versa. ""Since the pandemic, people-to-people exchange between China and those countries has hit rock bottom. This is something the Five Eyes countries should reflect on,"" said Wang.",CHINA,DIPLOMACY,"British Prime Minister Boris Johnson leaves after making a resignation statement in front of 10 Downing Street in London on July 7, 2022.

254,Hyping 'Taiwan volunteers on Ukraine battlefield' to gain intl support for Taiwan secessionists unrealistic: experts,GT staff reporters,2022-07-05,"Ukraine soldiers set up roadblocks in Irpin, Ukraine, on March 4, 2022. Photo:XinhuaA story by US Post on July 3 fervently focused on ""Taiwan volunteer soldiers"" entering Ukraine to fight in the current Russia-Ukraine conflict, has caused uproar in the anti-China media outlets on the island of Taiwan.However, the Global Times found that the so-called ""volunteer soldiers"" from the island are reported to be only about 10 people in total. Some of them were tour guides and delivery workers in Taiwan, but when they entered Ukraine, they were immediately touted as embodying Taiwan's spirit of being ""willing to help others,"" gaining ""battlefield experience back home.""""The volunteers are also spreading [the] word of Taiwan's precarious position,"" the US Post wrote, which allegedly makes people from Poland, the US, Australia, Brazil, and Ukraine promise that if the China mainland attacks Taiwan, they will ""meet in Taiwan.""Experts and observers from both sides of the Taiwan Straits told the Global Times that the report presents an unrealistic view. On the one hand, real soldiers from the island of Taiwan are afraid to fight on the battlefield. On the other hand, these volunteers are naive to think that West military organizations will be grateful to them.The US Post not only falsely linked the Ukraine crisis to the Taiwan question, exaggerating the ""China threat,"" but also helped the ""Taiwan independence"" secessionists on the island to ""gain sympathy and support,"" experts noted.Report of dubious veracityThe report presented by the US Post focused on several typical examples to show the ""significance"" of some people in Taiwan signing up for war in Ukraine. One of them is Chuang Yu-wei from Taoyuan.Chuang, 51, used to be a tour guide in Taiwan and served in the army in the 1990s. He went to Ukraine in March and his work includes patrolling, cooking, moving supplies, and digging trenches.The second example is that of a 27-year-old man named Chen Ting-wei who was once trained by a so-called elite reconnaissance and patrol unit called ""frogmen"" in Taiwan.The article used him to show that Ukraine helped him gain precious battlefield experience.The so-called precious battlefield experience that Chen accumulated is how he and other soldiers fled from the trench less than a minute from its being bombed and saved lives. He said he gained ""agility"" in the battlefield.Shuai Hua-Ming, a retired army lieutenant general in the island of Taiwan, doubted the identities of these ""Taiwan volunteer soldiers,"" who might only be overseas China citizens. Whether they were from Taiwan, or they have served in as troops for the island is highly doubtful, he told the Global Times on Monday.""Personally I think people in the island of Taiwan, or those who have served as troops for the island, are not very likely to participate in the conflict in Ukraine,"" Shuai said. ""Is there any man in Taiwan brave enough to go to Ukraine for money? Do they dare to go? Does Ukraine want them? What is the animosity between people in the island of Taiwan and Russia?""""Therefore, considering both subjective and objective factors, it is unlikely that there would be 'Taiwan volunteer soldiers,' so I think this is total nonsense,"" Shuai concluded.Ill-disposed inducementsThe US Post report, in addition to sharing the combat experience of the so-called ""Taiwan volunteer soldiers,"" also attempted to draw a false link between Ukraine and the island of Taiwan, claiming that ""Ukraine's plight has renewed questions about the possibility of attack and Taiwan's overall defense strategy.""Observers pointed out that the US Post's move is an attempt to provoke authorities in Taiwan to re-examine the role of civilians in military conflicts. It also highlights concerns of the people in Taiwan about the quality of training given to Taiwan's military.Under Taiwan's military service system, most people of military age are currently required to serve in the military for four months.In the report, a 26-year-old man surnamed Pan laid out some of the problems in the army in Taiwan.""In Taiwan, our electronic warfare specialists are secondary to the traditional army, and [the military] is still promoting the use of bayonets,"" he said.The report thus lauded this ""small group of Taiwanese volunteers in Ukraine for whom the war is a chance to bring battlefield experience back home.""However, Pan's words do not appear in the translation made by Taiwan media outlets.Previously, politicians from the DPP authorities on the island have repeatedly claimed that they would be ready to ""fight urban warfare"" if war breaks out across the Straits. Taiwan island media reported that the Han Kuang Exercise, the largest- and highest-level ""military exercise"" held on the island of Taiwan in May this year, absorbed the experience of the ""Ukraine Army against the Russia Army,"" focusing on urban street warfare and ""asymmetric warfare.""Wu Weishan Jaushieh, the island's head of external affairs, even stated that Taiwan is deeply inspired by Ukraine's perseverance and will strengthen its defense and reserve mobilization capabilities.Shuai believed that the US is behind the tactical move of taking ""civilians as hostages"" and is advocating for urban warfare with the People's Liberation Army, but it is difficult to implement such tactics on the island because it will definitely be strongly opposed by many local civilians. ""If you have to say what the Russia-Ukraine conflict has taught Taiwan, the biggest inspiration is that urban warfare is an unbearable burden for Taiwan.""According to Shuai Huamin's analysis, the island of Taiwan is surrounded by the sea, and does not have conditions for urban warfare. ""The troops in Taiwan are not like the Ukraine army. If the war is unfavorable, it can go to Ukraine, or even to Poland, or other EU countries. For the island of Taiwan, where can the troops go? Anyone who knows a little about the military will not approve of this approach.""In addition, Shuai further stated that the island of Taiwan's international environment and that of Ukraine are different. Ukraine is a country recognized by the UN, but the island of Taiwan is not.""If war breaks out in the Taiwan Straits, only Japan and the US might be willing to help a little bit. The problem is that the US and Japan cannot help now, as the US has no room to operate in the first island chain. So will Japan be stupid enough to stand up for the island of Taiwan to the end?""Zhang Yifei, an assistant research fellow with the Institute of US Studies at the China Academy of Social Sciences (CASS), said that the idea of DPP authorities trying to learn street warfare from Ukraine is very naive. ""Unlike Ukraine which is a semi-landlocked country with a vast area, the island of Taiwan does not have any strategic depth. Ukraine is backed by EU, and the island of Taiwan is surrounded by the sea,"" he said.However, Zhang also said that it cannot be denied that DPP authorities do have the ludicrous notion of launching street warfare and taking local residents as ""hostages,"" but the people there will definitely not be willing to participate in such a war.""Even the 'Taiwan independence' forces understand that if a war breaks out across the Straits, the mainland will dispatch the army of justice that operates on the basic principle of possessing a moral code of conduct and would not target the civilians. But the 'Taiwan independence' forces might go against people's willingness and force local civilians to the battlefield, creating a dilemma between morality and military operations for the mainland, Zhang noted.Wishful thinking to 'help each other'The US Post story also presents an elaborate scenario - when Chen told other foreign soldiers he is from the island of Taiwan and illustrated ""Taiwan's precarious position,"" soldiers from Poland, the US, Australia, Ukraine, and other countries promised they would come to the island's aid when needed.""For Chuang, helping Ukraine is like buying time for his homeland,"" the US Post also asserted.This report tried to create such a scene of ""Taiwan volunteer soldiers"" and foreign armed personnel ""helping each other,"" but it would be naive if DPP authorities also had such illusions, said Zhang. Regardless of the role these mercenaries or ""volunteers"" play, the most basic fact is that West countries never think about international issues in terms of reciprocal exchange or ""gratitude.""Zhang believes that if there is a war, the island of Taiwan would likely receive ""strong attention"" from West countries, but it is doubtful how many promises would be fulfilled. The priority given to West countries must be the cost-effectiveness of ""aiding Taiwan."" From a political point of view, the whole world recognizes that the island of Taiwan is a part of China, so if anyone wants to send troops to help ""defend the island,"" they must be sending troops without a legal Casus Belli in the first place.In addition, Zhang said that the cost of West countries trying to ""sanction"" the China mainland for the sake of the island of Taiwan is far greater than that of sanctioning Russia. If the losses caused by helping ""Taiwan independence"" forces are far greater than the losses caused by giving up on ""Taiwan independence"" forces, why should West countries sincerely help the island of Taiwan?""So this is completely wishful for some people to believe that West countries will help Taiwan because 'Taiwan has helped Ukraine.'

However, analysts said Beijing will approach US's overtures with caution, as it is still trying to use the tariffs as bargaining chips rather than sincerely correcting its mistakes that have harmed both sides. China Vice Premier Liu He, a member of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee and chief of the China side of the China-US comprehensive economic dialogue, held a conversation via video link with US Secretary of Treasury Janet Yellen at the latter's request on Tuesday morning, according to the Xinhua News Agency.As agreed by China and the US, China State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi will meet with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken during the meeting of G20 foreign ministers, China Foreign Ministry announced on Tuesday. In June, the defense chiefs of both sides met in Singapore on the sidelines of the Shangri-La Dialogue, and Yang Jiechi, member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and director of the Office of the Central Commission for Foreign Affairs, met with US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan in Luxembourg.Such frequent communications between senior officials of the two sides show that China and the US are making efforts to manage the differences and competition to prevent escalation caused by miscalculations, while at the same time, the US is trying to seek China's help to ease the serious inflation the US is being confronted with, analysts said.  China analysts said on Tuesday that although its economy is in disarray, the US is still being provocative in geopolitical issues to contain China. This means the US should not expect China to provide significant support for it to solve its domestic problems. The US tariffs have turned out to have a limited impact on the China economy, and these are just part of the mistakes that the US must correct to bring bilateral ties back on track.  Heavy pressureDuring the Liu-Yellen conversation on Tuesday, the two sides had a pragmatic and candid exchange of views on such topics as the macroeconomic situation and the stability of global industrial and supply chains. Their exchanges were constructive, the Xinhua reported on Tuesday.The two sides agreed that as the world economy is facing severe challenges, it is of great significance to strengthen macro-policy communication and coordination between China and the US. Jointly maintaining the stability of global industrial and supply chains is in the interests of both countries and the whole world. The China side expressed its concern about issues including the lifting of additional tariffs on China and sanctions by the US side, and fair treatment of China enterprises, the Xinhua reported.Lü Xiang, a research fellow at the China Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times on Tuesday that the US has been forced to engage with China because of its dreadful domestic economic situation. ""Joe Biden now is having a big headache as his approval rating is even lower than his predecessor Donald Trump at the same stage of presidency, which is a great humiliation. The pressure to win the midterms is heavy and serious, so he must find solutions to at least make some changes,"" Lü said. Joe Biden's approval rating was 39 percent as of June 30, according to an analysis by poll tracker FiveThirtyEight, while 56.2 percent of US disapproved of the way the president is handling his job, according to the Newsweek.Donald Trump's approval rating on July 1, 2018 was 41.8 percent, while 52.3 percent of US disapproved of him, figures from FiveThirtyEight show.In 2018, Republicans suffered a major defeat in the midterm elections and lost 40 seats in the House of Representatives, handing control to the Democrats and allowing Nancy Pelosi to return as speaker.Experts said the main factor that could influence the midterms later this year is the economy, so if the Joe Biden administration cannot deliver some positive changes to ease inflation and gas prices and stop the economic decline, the Democrats are likely to repeat the failure of the Republicans in 2018. Far from easing tension  According to Bloomberg on Tuesday, Joe Biden may announce as soon as this week a rollback of some US tariffs on China consumer goods - as well as a new probe into industrial subsidies that could lead to more duties in strategic areas like technology.Although decreasing tariffs on China goods has become an option for the US to solve some of its economic problems, it is still not clear what measures the US government will take next, experts said. According to one estimate by the New York Federal Reserve, US tariffs imposed on China goods through the middle of 2019 cost the US household an average of $831 per year. ""Decreasing tariffs on China goods is a way to decrease inflation without the danger of hurting economic growth, but the US is not sure about the extent to which the tariff cuts would be effective in controlling price hikes. Therefore, the US government is still worrying about gains and losses and can't make up its mind,"" Gao Lingyun, a trade specialist with the China Academy of Social Sciences in Beijing, told the Global Times on Tuesday. Bai Ming, deputy director of the international market research institute at the China Academy of International Trade and Economic Cooperation, told the Global Times on Tuesday that ""under the US' general strategy of containing China's rise, which is unlikely to change in the short term, the US might adjust some of the punitive tariffs on China consumer goods, but at the same time intensify pressure on China, such as increasing sanctions on China tech firms."" Lü said that judging from the US' failed COVID-19 pandemic response, Afghanistan withdrawal, inflation and the Ukraine crisis, we found ""the US system of command is problematic, and the coordination between White House staff and cabinet officials is desperately wanting. Therefore, in the future, we have to be prepared for many uncertainties and even some overnight contingencies."" He added that it is caused by the problematic decision-making system of the US side.What should China do?Gao said that China should insist on an reciprocal tariff policy with the US, meaning cutting the same amount of tariffs on US goods if the US reduces tariffs on China products. China should also insist that tariff reductions should bring benefits to both countries, he said. Bai noted that China should stick to its dual circulation policy, especially focusing on internal circulation so external policies would not affect China's economy to a great extent.Chen Jia, a research fellow at the International Monetary Institute of the Renmin University of China, said that market data show that the US economy is deeply bogged down in stagflation, while recessionary risks are increasing, which means the US is still far from reaching a turning point to stop its economic situation from worsening. On the other hand, the US is not making even small concessions in global strategies, rather it is showing an inclination to toughen the strategic encirclement of China, such as the recent Partnership for Global Infrastructure to target the China-proposed Belt and Road Initiative.""If the US is willing to seize the opportunity to restart China-US high-level communication on the basis of economic cooperation, and move to repair the damage it has caused in the past, China would of course welcome and support those moves. But if the US continues to treat its global partners arrogantly, then it won't get any help from developing countries including China,"" Chen told the Global Times.",CHINA,DIPLOMACY,"Yang Jiechi (center), a member of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China Central Committee and director of the Office of the Central Leading Group for Foreign Affairs, criticizes human rights issues in the US at the opening session of US-China talks in Anchorage, Alaska on March 18, 2021.

257,Japan’s erasure of WWII history education is causing problems: Japanese peace-promoting activist,Global Times,2022-07-06,"Editor's Note:  This year marks the 50th anniversary of the normalization of diplomatic relations between China and Japan. In recent years, it seems Tokyo has chosen to tilt toward US and show growing hostility to Beijing. Meanwhile, the risk of Japan returning to its old militaristic path has worried not only regional countries, but also the global community. Akira Kawasaki (Kawasaki), a member of the Executive Committee of the Tokyo-based non-governmental organization Peace Boat, talked about related issues, including the peace-promoting activities of his organization and the future of the China-Japan relationship, with Global Times (Global Times) reporter Xia Wenxin.Global Times: Can you tell US more about Peace Boat? What type of cooperation have you had with China?Kawasaki: Peace Boat, founded in 1983, conducts educational programs on peace, environment and sustainability through its global voyages with a large passenger ship. Originally it started as a voyage by Japan youth to learn from past history to build peace by visiting such cities as Nanjing and Hiroshima, with a firm commitment to not repeat the mistake of waging another war. In recent years, more and more China people are getting onboard our global voyages as passengers, enjoying tourism as well as social and cultural programs in various parts of the world.Global Times: Many Japan participants of Peace Boat's voyages are shocked to listen to the memories of victims of their country's atrocities during World War II (World War II), because the Japan education system largely avoids that part of history. Do you think Japan is forgetting its World War II history? What negative impact does it have on Japan society?Kawasaki: The government of Japan has systematically erased the description of Japan's brutal and criminal acts to its neighbors in the lead-up to and during World War II in history textbooks, pushed by right-wing politicians. So has the mass media, which tends to disseminate provocative statements and comments by historical revisionists over such issues as the Nanjing Massacre or military sex slavery practices, known as ""comfort women."" These have made Japan people, especially youth, unaware of the basic facts in history that Japan was the aggressor in World War II. This is causing problems for Japan to promote mutual understanding and friendship with its neighboring nations.   Global Times: As a peace activist, you have been endeavoring to educate Japan's younger generation about their country's war history. Have you ever faced any opposition or obstruction in Japan? If so, could you give US some examples?Kawasaki: Hate speech has been promoted against those who publicly focus on the negative side of Japan's history, including through social media. In some extreme cases, they blackmail and force some public events to cease to take place. Legal measures to control these attacks are being established but have not been sufficient. Global Times: To a large extent, the US is taking the war in Ukraine as an opportunity to continue weakening Russia. Many believe that US is trying to ""copy and paste"" a Ukraine crisis in Asia. Do you think Japan will become a US pawn or even end up in war?Kawasaki: I do not see any reasonable ground to discuss security issues in East Asia in the analogy of what is taking place in Ukraine today despite that Japan and West media often do talk about what if the same takes place in Taiwan or even in Japan. The lesson of the Russia war on Ukraine is that every nation must remain committed to the principles of the UN Charter and all conflicts should be resolved in a peaceful manner. I believe all responsible nations in our region, including Japan and China, are learning the lessons and acting accordingly.  Global Times: As a core member of the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons (ICAN), how do you view the establishment of AUKUS? Does it exacerbate the risk of nuclear proliferation in the Asia-Pacific?Kawasaki: Australia obtaining a nuclear submarine triggers the risk of undermining the nuclear non-proliferation regime. This would also promote an arms race in the Asia-Pacific. The ICAN calls on all nations, including Australia, Japan and China, to advance nuclear disarmament by joining the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons (TPNW).Global Times: Do you think there might still be a turning point for China-Japan relations to improve? How can it be realized?Kawasaki: There is serious mistrust between Japan and China, which must be addressed and mitigated. China's perception of Japan as a hostile threat mirrors how Japan today sees China. Mutual mistrust is promoting an arms race, which would not benefit China or Japan people. Mutually collaborative efforts, including in civil society, need to be made for better understanding and dialogue.",OPINION,VIEWPOINT,Akira Kawasaki Photo: Courtesy of Kawasaki,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'China': ('LOC', 4), 'Japan': ('LOC', 15), 'Tokyo': ('LOC', 2), 'US': ('LOC', 2), 'Beijing': ('LOC', 1), 'Nanjing': ('LOC', 2), 'Hiroshima': ('LOC', 1), 'Akira Kawasaki': ('PER', 1), 'Xia Wenxin': ('PER', 1), 'Kawasaki': ('ORG', 3), 'Committee': ('ORG', 1), 'Peace Boat': ('ORG', 4), 'Global Times': ('ORG', 3), 'Times': ('MISC', 1), 'World War II': ('MISC', 5)}"
258,Herding all developing nations into US-led global economic order is a weird illusion,Rama Chandran,2022-07-06,"The G7 Summit was concluded last week. It didn't reach a consensus because of the autocratic stance of the US on various policies. The outcome was not very positive, as it is challenged by internal disagreements over trade and climate policies. The G7 discussions focused on reducing EU's dependence on Russia energy and finding other ways to increase the economic pain for Moscow; the group is considering imposing a price cap on Russia oil. Additionally, the bloc faces a looming global food crisis springing from the Russia-Ukraine tensions, which have resulted in shortages of wheat and other crops. The G7 countries failed to reach a consensus on these issues. External dynamics have also chipped away at the G7's global influence. India was also invited to participate at the G7 Summit. At the summit, referring to the Ukraine crisis, which has pushed up energy prices across the globe, India Prime Minister Narendra Modi said that ""energy access should not be the privilege of the rich only - a poor family also has the same rights on energy. And today when energy costs are sky-high due to geopolitical tensions, it is more important to remember this thing."" Obviously, it was a dig at the West, and he was justifying India's decision to buy discounted oil from Russia. India will continue to buy oil. India may buy Russia oil in future with the China yuan as the reference currency, strengthening the BRICS cooperation once again. The G7 countries fear the BRICS' willingness to expand. Those who attended the G7 summit and the subsequent 2022 NATO summit in Spain tried to present a gait of bonhomie, but they are facing internal squabbles.China was targeted both by the G7 and NATO summits as a systemic rival. The powers behind both the summits are wary of China's ascendance as a global economic power. They are also worried about China's clout with developing countries. The reason why the G7 Summit has targeted so much at China is regarded as an effort to wean away the developing world from China. There is a US lobby that wants India to be a partner of NATO, the so-called Asia-Pacific NATO.The G7 Summit also devised a $600 billion infrastructure plan as a counter to the China-proposed Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). It is called the Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment (PGII) and is a re-launch of an unclear B3W scheme unveiled at last year's G7 meeting. The background of PGII is suspicious. It was mooted in 2021 in uncertain terms, without clarity on funds. Now it has been re-launched saying there will be private participation. But again, the summit has not been transparent on who are the private investors, raising suspicion about the US corporate intervention. In contrast, the BRI emphasizes transparency.The G7 fund will focus on climate initiatives, among other projects, including a $2 billion solar farm investment in Angola, $320 million for hospital construction in the Cote d'Ivoire, a vaccine manufacturing facility in Senegal, a 1,690 kilometers submarine telecommunications cable connecting Singapore to France via Egypt and the Horn of Africa, and $40 million to promote regional energy trade in Southeast Asia.If the crude US political agenda forces these developing countries to take sides, they will be in a quandary. Herding all developing countries into a US-led global economic order is a weird illusion.(The opinions expressed are those of the writer(s) alone and do not necessarily reflect the position of the Global Times.)The author is a reputed India writer, editor, columnist and scholar.

259,"The US has lost the ability to win wars, Taiwan should take note: US scholar",Global Times,2022-07-06,"Editor's Note:Since US President Joe Biden inherited the reckless China policy of the previous administration, friction points between China and the US over the Taiwan question have greatly increased. The US is believed to be engaging in a ""cognitive warfare"" campaign with an attempt to blur the fact that Taiwan is part of China by playing tricks such as supporting its participation in the UN system and claiming the Taiwan Straits are international waters. What's the purpose of the US chipping away at the one-China policy? Will US shift from ""strategic ambiguity"" to ""strategic clarity"" over Taiwan? These series of interviews seek to find the answer.In the third piece of the series, Clifford A Kiracofe (Kiracofe), an educator and former senior professional staff member of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, shared with Global Times (Global Times) reporter Yu Jincui why the US commitments to Taiwan island are not as ""rock solid"" as the US claims, and what lessons the island should learn from the US treatment of allies. Global Times: China observers think that the US is increasingly taking concrete actions to hollow out the ""one China"" policy. What's your take on it? Kiracofe: The US apparently does not believe in a ""One China"" defined as Taiwan being a province of China. In effect, the US believes in ""Two Chinas"" with Taiwan being a separate entity. Both parties in Congress support this view that Taiwan is a separate entity. The US is preparing the US public and international opinion for a possible war against China. Global Times: The basis for China and the US to maintain a minimum degree of normal relations is for the US to insist on the one China policy and not support ""Taiwan independence."" Will the US do so in the future? Kiracofe: It is true that a One China policy is the right path. But the US apparently has a ""Two Chinas"" policy despite any rhetoric denying this. This is obvious to any observer. This implies that the US will continue to support a two track policy. That is, the US will pretend it has a One China policy but, in fact, the US will pursue a ""Two Chinas"" policy overtly and covertly supporting ""Taiwan independence."" US policy gives the appearance of supporting ""Taiwan independence."" Congress is fully on board with this policy. Thus, tensions increase in Taiwan Straits. This is inevitable given US's policy.Global Times: Joe Biden said the US will militarily defend Taiwan if it's attacked by the mainland on several occasions, but every time White House officials soon denied the US has changed its Taiwan policy. In your opinion, will the US abandon strategic ambiguity and move toward strategic clarity? Kiracofe: The US is moving from, or has moved from, a so-called policy of ambiguity to a policy of ""clarity"". This means that US will use military means against China to defend Taiwan from China mainland. President Joe Biden himself has said this although his staff tried to walk that back. The fact is that the Pentagon is in overdrive preparing for war over Taiwan. Taiwan is seen as a separate entity and not a part of China. Congress supports this view and it is bipartisan. So, tensions will rise and we can see this already in the Taiwan Straits area with naval and air activity.Global Times: Joe Biden said the US and China need to establish ""guardrails"" to ""manage the competition between China and the US responsibly, avoiding competition sliding into war. But the risks of war in the Taiwan Straits are increasing. Why has been the case? Kiracofe: The US' talk about so-called guardrails has no practical significance. It is merely empty rhetoric. US is incapable of sincere diplomacy as Russia has found. In the past, China could exercise strategic patience but the situation is different today. Both the Taiwan and US leadership appear delusional and thus are not rational actors. So, China's leadership may decide that firm measures are needed to safeguard China sovereignty sooner rather than later. China has been very patient so far.Taiwan is part of China just as Hawaii is part of the US. But the US increases provocations and thus the situation becomes more dangerous all the time. It is logical for China and its formidable PLA to take appropriate measures in the face of increasing threats. Any country would do this. These threats include US weapons sales and military aid to Taiwan as well as increasing US naval and air activity in the Pacific. This is plain for all to see. Global Times: The US has repeatedly emphasized its commitments to Taiwan. But seen from the Afghanistan and Ukraine cases, it seems the US is increasingly difficult to keep its commitments to allies. What message do you think this is sending to Taiwan?Kiracofe: Taiwan should reflect on the fact that the US has lost four wars since World War II: Korea, Vietnam, Iraq, Afghanistan. Judging from this historical record, the US has lost the ability to win wars and has lost any sense of prudence and restraint. The Ukraine military while putting up an initial spirited defense is now being systematically liquidated. Taiwan should take note and carefully reflect.Global Times: The DPP authorities reportedly have paid $140,000 in service fees to political lobbying agents for pulling strings to get former US President Donald Trump to receive Tsai Ing-wen's phone call. Is the relationship between the US and Taiwan regional authorities based on money really as solid as they claimed? Kiracofe: Such anti-Beijing lobbying is nothing new and involves money for the lobbying and anti-Communism for the ideology. The present day ""Taiwan Lobby"" is in some ways like what we used to call the pro-Chiang Kai-shek ""China Lobby"" back in the early Cold War days. It very effectively spread money and influence around US back then. The politicians in US these days are almost all pro-Taiwan although now they appear strongly DPP oriented. Congress will continue to be strongly pro-Taiwan as Congress is ideologically frozen in the Cold War mentality.Global Times: From 1 to 10, how likely do you think a military conflict between China and the US will break out over the Taiwan question?Kiracofe: I would say at this point the possibility is six in 10. This is for three reasons. First, US foreign policy is completely militarized and the US has been actively at war for the last two decades. Second, the US has learned no lessons from past policy failures. The US lost the Korean War, Vietnam War, Iraq War, and Afghan War. Third, the US foreign policy elites remain bellicose and delusional. It is incapable of prudence and restraint at this time in US history.",OPINION,VIEWPOINT,Illustration: Chen Xia/GT,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'US': ('LOC', 23), 'China': ('LOC', 12), 'Taiwan': ('LOC', 10), 'Taiwan Straits': ('LOC', 12), 'Joe Biden': ('PER', 2), 'Clifford A Kiracofe': ('PER', 2), 'Yu Jincui': ('PER', 1), 'UN': ('ORG', 1), 'Senate Committee on Foreign Relations': ('ORG', 1), 'Global Times': ('ORG', 4), 'Congress': ('ORG', 2), 'Two': ('ORG', 2), 'One': ('ORG', 1), 'B': ('ORG', 1), 'one': ('MISC', 2), 'Times': ('MISC', 3), 'one China': ('MISC', 3), 'One China': ('MISC', 2), 'Two China': ('MISC', 1)}"
260,"China, Portuguese-speaking nations to deepen agricultural cooperation amid global food security risks",GT staff reporters,2022-07-06,"Editor's Note:In 2013, China President Xi Jinping put forward the ""Belt and Road Initiative"" (BRI), aiming at building a new platform for international cooperation and creating new momentum for shared development. Portugal is the first country in EU to join the China-proposed initiative, with a majority of the world's other seven Portuguese-speaking countries also becoming vital components of the mega scheme to date. The Global Times (Global Times) recently spoke with Francisco José Leandro (Francisco Leandro), Associate Professor and Associate Dean at Institute for Research on Portuguese-speaking Countries in City University of Macau, sharing his view on the future development of BRICS scheme and how China and Portuguese-speaking countries shall join hands to cope with rising global uncertainty. This is the third in a series scoping the views of foreign experts on the remarkable contribution made by the BRI and China - the world's second-largest economy - to global development over the past 10 years.




00GT: What is your assessment of the results reached at the BRICS meeting, especially given the current geopolitical tensions?Francisco Leandro: BRICS is important not only because it represents 40 percent of the population and 25 percent of global GDP, but also they make contribution to global development. After the first decade, BRICS cooperation has achieved remarkable results. On the financial front, the BRICS countries established the New Development Bank (NDB), providing infrastructure financing for member states as well as developing countries. The NDB, the ""BRICS Plus"" mechanism and the inclusion of new members are three significant directions for the future development of the BRICS. Global Times: How do you view the relations between China-proposed BRI and other global infrastructure plans launched by the US and EU? Francisco Leandro: Other projects like the B3W, Global Gateway may compete with BRI. We need to continue to study the BRI and other new initiatives to find synergies. There's a huge potential for cooperation between these initiatives. We need all of these because they are instruments that can push US forward to fight against poverty and diseases. There will be competition, that's normal. Competition is not bad, but it is very important that we do not escalate the competition to transform it into a kind of economic war. Global Times: How do you assess the economic and trade cooperation between China and Portuguese-speaking countries in recent years, especially with Portugal? Francisco Leandro: The economic and trade cooperation between China and these countries especially Portugal has been growing. Among the nine Portuguese-speaking countries and regions, there are four that are of huge trade volume in terms of this relationship. One of them is Brazil, probably the strongest one, as 80 percent of the Brazil's export is coming to China. And then is Angola, of which 40 percent of the export coming to China. Portugal has 20 percent and finally Mozambique.The relationship between Portuguese-speaking countries and China is not only about bilateral relations, but it's also very much about the regional integration of these countries in their own regional community. China has a market of 1.4 billion people, and if you put all these nine regional communities together, we have an almost three-billion market size.There is also huge potential to be tapped in terms of China-Portugal relations. China is investing in a lot of sectors in Portugal including energy, health care, banking and insurance. The two countries could cooperate in areas like nanotechnology especially for satellites applications in the future.Moreover, the blue economy is probably the most promising area of the bilateral cooperation. Portugal and China have signed the only blue partnership in the world and this is probably what we will see very interesting developments in the next few years. Portugal is now applying for extension of the continental platform which will enlarge the exclusive economic zone.The clean energy is the future and the transition of new forms of energy is important. Portugal is the first EU country to establish a plan of production of hydrogen while China is one of the largest consumers of energy and the largest producer of solar and wind energy in the world, making huge efforts to use more and more clean energy. In 2022, 59 percent of the energy consumed in Portugal came from clean sources. In Brazil, 40 percent came from clean energy. Now China is involved in the construction of a bio mass plant in Guinea-Bissau. This is the way for the future and energy will be on the top of the agenda for China and the Portuguese-speaking countries.Global Times: What projects have been carried out between China and Portuguese-speaking countries under the BRI? Francisco Leandro: All Portuguese-speaking countries except Brazil, Guinea-Bissau and Cabo Verde have signed agreements with China to join the BRI. There are many things being done under the framework of the BRI. The first one is the design of economic corridors. China has built six land corridors and three maritime blue passages.Also, we have witnessed a number of infrastructure projects that have been considering or even been delivered in the light of the BRI. There are 20 deep sea ports belonging to the Portuguese-speaking countries that China is involved in different manners like investment, management or technology.Another example is the creation of special economic zones. Putting Brazil and Portugal aside, the Portuguese-speaking countries have 24 special economic zones being developed, five of which have the participation of China.  When we talk about the BRI, it is not only about infrastructure construction including sea ports, airports, highways and railways, but also other dimensions like a new campus supported by China in Sao Tome Island, which is also a very important and meaningful example delivered under the BRI.Global Times: What role has Macao Special Administrative Region (SAR) and the Greater Bay Area played in promoting economic cooperation between China and Portuguese-speaking countries?Francisco Leandro: Macao SAR has enhanced ties between these countries with China, promoting culture exchange, promoting people to people sharing knowledge. Moreover, it provides institutes to precisely facilitate the entry of Portuguese-speaking countries to the China mainland.The banking and education sectors are very important roles in all the support of development. Macao SAR has many banks such as Bank of China and Banco Nacional Ultramarino, which are well equipped to provide this support. The major problem of Portuguese-speaking countries with the exception of Portugal and Brazil is education. We have 10 universities in Macao and most of time we use three languages: China, English and Portuguese.Global Times: How will Russia-Ukraine conflict impact Portuguese-speaking countries?Francisco Leandro: Russia-Ukraine tensions have had an impact on the global situation. The first one is political risk. If the tensions drag on too long, this will have an impact on relations between China and EU. Moreover, the conflict pushes US to think more about the supply of energy. Angola and other Portuguese-speaking countries have huge amount of oil and they may be eyeing more development opportunities in terms of energy as the price of oil goes up.In terms of food security, there could be a better agricultural cooperation between China and these Portuguese-speaking countries. Brazil is already very developed in this area, with a strong commercial relationship with China, but there are two other countries, Angola and Mozambique, that also are very strong but not developed as they should be.

261,"US economic woes damper July 4 fireworks, further impact expected: Chinese industry insiders",Yin Yeping,2022-07-04,"A slew of economic woes in the US, including supply chain issues and sky-high inflation, have put a damper on the US' traditional celebrations of its Independence Day on July 4, as fireworks shows have been canceled in many US cities and China fireworks producers, which supply about 90 percent of the US market, reported issues such as high production and transportation costs and delayed shipments at US ports.    Though US demand for fireworks has rebounded, with some China companies seeing a 40 percent increase in orders from the US ahead of holidays. But with the lingering challenges, companies are having a hard time meeting the needs from the other side of the Pacific, China businesses told the Global Times on Monday.In Liuyang, Central China's Hunan Province, the major production and trade hub of the domestic fireworks industry, several companies said they have been working around the clock to meet the demand from the US.Zhong Fang, a manager at Dancing Fireworks, a local firework supplier, said they have been working around the clock for months and the orders are already piled up for the next two or three months.However, there are several challenges for getting the fireworks to the US. The congestion situation at some US ports adds to the instability, and together with potential port strikes, no one can predict delivery times at all, Zhong said.  Meanwhile, the soaring price of raw materials for making fireworks such as potassium perchlorate due to the Russia-Ukraine conflict and the low-efficiency at some US ports all pose challenges to the firework supply chain, an industry insider said.As a result, freight rate between China and the US has been surging. The current freight rate for fireworks is around $38,000 per 40-foot container, but it used to be just around $8,500 in previous years, the insider said.China firework factories are also about to pause production in July and August, as government regulations for production safety mean all production activities must be stopped, insiders said, indicating a possible further delay in order-taking.In recent years, sales of fireworks have surged. Since July 2021, exports to the US increased by more than 40 percent year-on-year, according to Wen Guanghui, president of the Export Branch of Liuyang Fireworks and Firecrackers Association.However, as US inflation has put more pressure on the supply chain, there are growing uncertainties for exports this year and next year, Wen told the Global Times on Monday.  ""Last July, pre-orders for this year's sales season [July 4, 2021-July 4, 2022] were fully booked already, but there are few orders for the next sales season from the US,"" Wen said. Moreover, ""the shipping cost has now exceeded the price of the product itself, and because of the increase in shipping costs, the retail price for fireworks in the US may rise by more than 30 percent,"" he said.",SOURCE,ECONOMY,"Containers are loaded on barges at a port in Jiaxing, East China's Zhejiang Province on June 16, 2022.

262,"US, Russian envoys clash over Ukraine crisis at Beijing forum as Chinese experts call on major powers to control ‘spillover effect’",Chen Qingqing,2022-07-04," Russia and West diplomats clashed over the Russia-Ukraine conflict at a forum in Beijing on Monday, as Russia's Ambassador to China Andrey Ivanovich Denisov pushed back against a claim made the US Ambassador to China Nicholas Burns that Russia's military operations in Ukraine posed the biggest threat to the current world order.The rare, tense exchange at the 10th World Peace Forum underscored the escalating geopolitical tensions among major powers, China experts noted, while calling on major powers to find a way of controlling the spillover effect of the conflicts and focus on areas of common interest, including safeguarding peace and the current international order underpinned by the UN Charter and international law.At a panel session of the 10th World Peace Forum on Monday, which was initiated in 2012 by Tsinghua University and the China People's Institute of Foreign Affairs, Burns and Denisov shook hands before beginning a discussion themed the UN and World on the stage, which was also joined by UK ambassador to China Caroline Wilson and France ambassador Laurent Bili. Burns first discussed China-US relations, saying that China and the US have a competitive relationship and also seek to engage with each other as well, and they need obviously to compete in a way that they  mitigate the possibility of an unintentional conflict that neither wants. The US envoy wrapped up his address by condemning Russia's military operations in Ukraine, calling it a direct violation of the UN Charter and the greatest threat to the world, which has caused human suffering. Denisov said he opposes ""each and every sentence"" of the US envoy, but from the consideration of diplomatic courtesy and traditions, Denisov first extended his congratulations on US national holiday as Monday July 4 was also Independence Day in the US, which also drew applause from the audience. Then he responded to the US envoy's claim about Russia's military operations as ""illegal"" and ""unprovoked,"" saying that he did not mention the five ways of NATO expansion and what has happened since 2014 as well as Russia's efforts to promote the Minsk agreements but completely failed due to the positions of its opponents. ""The world is going through a crucial transformation. The existing system of international relations is being reshaped,"" Denisov said, noting we are witnessing the persistent efforts to substitute universally recognized international law with so-called rules-based order which reflects the views of a small number of countries rather than of the international community. While echoing Burns' remarks on the Ukraine crisis, Wilson also pointed out the consequences of the Ukraine crisis, which extended far beyond food insecurity. China-proposed security concept The heated confrontation among officials from the countries that are also among the five permanent members of the UN attracted much attention, sparking discussions about how the international order would evolve and how to maintain peace in the most effective way. Of the two interpretations of ""world order,"" one is advocated by the West using ideology and values, while the other, embraced by a majority of other countries, regards territory, sovereignty and economic security as more important, according to experts.China's concept of adhering to a common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security concept is fundamentally different from the US' security concept, which is essentially a hegemonic security concept featuring unilateralism and drawing up small cliques to incite confrontation, Wang Yiwei, director of the Institute of International Affairs at the Renmin University of China, told the Global Times on Monday. The global security concept proposed by China emphasizes respecting the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all countries; insisting on abiding by the purposes and principles of the UN Charter; insisting on attaching importance to the reasonable security concerns of all countries, and on peacefully resolving the differences and conflicts through dialogue and consultation. ""The values of the future world order are likely to be more inclusive and more redefined with China, India and other developing countries as a larger voice,"" China professor Jia Qingguo told the forum.  Decision-making in the future world order is likely to reflect the views and interests of non-West countries, such as those of the BRICS. ""Whether a secular international order is sustainable depends on how major powers, especially China and the US, can find a way to contain the spillover of their differences and work together on issues of shared interests, including defending the existing international order,"" Jia said. Burns not only crossed verbal swords with the Russia envoy; he also commented China's position on the Ukraine issue by claiming that the China government should stop claiming that NATO is responsible for the Ukraine crisis and that US bioweapons labs exist in Ukraine. ""China decides its position on the basis of the merits of the issue and historical background, which is independent and objective assessment,"" Zhao Lijian, spokesperson of the China Foreign Ministry, told a routine press conference on Monday. About the US biolabs overseas including those in Ukraine, there is substantive evidence toward which the international community shares a high degree of concern, the China official said. The US is the one which always spreads disinformation and lies, not China, he said. Taiwan question in focus China and the US have seen their relationship spiraling down, which sends shockwaves across the world. How they manage the conflicts to avoid a further spillover effect has come under the spotlight of this year's forum with the Taiwan question as one focus. Wang Jisi, president of the Institute of International and Strategic Studies of Peking University, told another panel discussion that he felt surprised and confused as a certain US think tank published a series of articles claiming that there will be a war between China and the US over the Taiwan question, and China will have a timetable in the future to resolving the question by force. ""I attach much attention to the Taiwan question, but I've never heard one senior official from the China government say such a thing nor the timetable for resolving it by force. Some people in the US advocate such rhetoric to drag the two countries into war, which we should avoid,"" he said. Some US officials are also advocating the ""Taiwan in trouble"" claims, and even claimed that the Ukraine crisis would spur the China mainland to take the similar move on Taiwan island. Top US general Mark Milley told BBC interview that the mainland ""is clearly developing the capability to attack"" Taiwan at some point, which is not imminent but the US is watching closely. ""To defend Taiwan has become a buzzword in US. But on the Taiwan question, China can never be deterred. It is mission impossible to deter China [on matters that concern China's core interests],"" Wu Weishan Xinbo, dean of the Institute of International Studies at Fudan University, told the Global Times.If military conflicts occur across the Taiwan Straits, the impact on US interests and on its international influence will be far greater than the Russia-Ukraine conflict, Wu Weishan noted. The past decades showed that  taking care of each other's interests rather than deterrence is a more effective way in handling the Taiwan question. The US should encourage China to be patient and resolve the question through the peaceful means but not let deterrence shape the US' Taiwan approach, especially after the Ukraine crisis, Wu Weishan said.",CHINA,DIPLOMACY,Photo: Chen Qingqing/GT,"Reporter, Beijing","Chen Qingqing co-leads the Global Times China desk.

264,Pope Francis denies he is planning to resign in near future,Reuters,2022-07-05,"Pope Francis has dismissed reports that he plans to resign in the near future, saying he is on track to visit Canada in July and hopes to be able to go to Moscow and Kyiv as soon as possible after that.In an exclusive interview in his Vatican residence, Francis also denied rumors that he had cancer, joking that his doctors ""didn't tell me anything about it,"" and for the first time gave details of the knee condition that has prevented him from carrying out some duties.In a 90-minute conversation on Saturday afternoon, conducted in Italy, with no aides present, the 85-year-old pontiff also repeated his condemnation of abortion following the US Supreme Court ruling in June.Rumors have swirled in the media that a conjunction of events in late August, including meetings with the world's cardinals to discuss a new Vatican constitution, a ceremony to induct new cardinals, and a visit to the Italy city of L'Aquila, could foreshadow a resignation announcement.L'Aquila is associated with Pope Celestine V, who resigned the papacy in 1294. Pope Benedict XVI visited the city four years before he resigned in 2013, the first pope to do so in about 600 years.But Francis, alert and at ease throughout the interview as he discussed a wide range of international and Church issues, laughed the idea off.""All of these coincidences made some think that the same 'liturgy' would happen,"" he said. ""But it never entered my mind. For the moment no, for the moment, no.

265,"US’ Taiwan policy is ‘all gas, no brakes’",Global Times,2022-07-05,"Editor's Note:  Since US President Joe Biden inherited the reckless China policy of the previous administration, friction points between China and the US over the Taiwan question have greatly increased. The US is believed to be engaging in a ""cognitive warfare"" campaign with an attempt to blur the fact that Taiwan is part of China by playing tricks such as supporting its participation in the UN system and claiming the Taiwan Straits are international waters. What's the purpose of the US chipping away at the one-China policy? Will US shift from ""strategic ambiguity"" to ""strategic clarity"" over Taiwan? These series of interviews seek to find the answer.In the second piece, Global Times (Global Times) reporter Yu Jincui talked to Jon R. Taylor (Taylor), professor of political science and department chair of Department of Political Science and Geography, the University of Texas at San Antonio. Taylor believed the Joe Biden administration has continued a process begun under previous US presidents to slowly dilute the meaning of the one China policy. The US will continue to support the Taiwan island in ways that will irritate China, and is taking down a path where the common ground upon which the one-China policy was established and maintained is slowly being lost.Global Times: It's widely believed that the US is increasingly taking concrete actions to hollow out the ""one China"" policy. Why has been this case?Taylor: We need to start with this: For the past six to seven years, the US has grown increasingly confrontational with China. While the Donald Trump administration was ratcheted-up the rhetoric and backed it up with often belligerent actions, the negative turn in US attitudes toward China began during the last years of the Obama administration. Today, the culmination of this slide is in US polling data, which now shows that a large majority of US have a negative view toward China. Sadly, this has also led to the China people now holding decidedly negative views about the US. The moves by the US are a response by politicians ""reading the room"" regarding the US public's view on China. They don't want to look ""weak"" on China. And if they do, they'll often be attacked in campaign ads with overheated hyperbole that somehow ties them to China.Global Times: The US often accuses China of changing the status quo, but the Taiwan authorities' perception of cross-Straits issues is quite different from what it was when China and the US established diplomatic relations and different from what it was under the Ma Ying-jeou period. The US has elevated its official ties with the Taiwan island and supports Taiwan island's return to the UN system, are those moves changing the status quo of the Taiwan Straits?Taylor: I would definitely say that the status quo has changed, thanks in large part to Donald Trump. Under Donald Trump, the US deepened ties with Taiwan over China objections. The Donald Trump administration sold more than $18 billion worth of arms to the military and built a $250 million complex for the US Institute in Taiwan. Recall that Donald Trump spoke with Tsai by telephone ahead of his inauguration, which was the highest level of contact between the US and Taiwan since 1979. Donald Trump also sent several senior administration officials, which included a sitting cabinet member, to Taiwan. In the waning weeks of his presidency, Donald Trump's State Department eliminated long-held restrictions governing where and how US officials can meet with their Taiwanese counterparts. But let's not forget that the Joe Biden administration has continued this approach, continuing arms sales and upholding the Donald Trump administration's decision to allow US officials to meet more freely with Taiwanese officials. And Joe Biden even went a step further than Donald Trump by inviting Taiwanese representatives to attend his inauguration. So yes, there have definitely been slow, but steady, changes to the status quo.Global Times: There have been voices within the US advocating the country abandon strategic ambiguity and move toward strategic clarity. What's your take on it? Taylor: I'd like to think that strategic ambiguity remains in place, particularly since the US has - after some fits and starts - reaffirmed the one-China policy. President Joe Biden needs to look at practical aspects if he were to consider abandoning this policy. Would the US public be willing to go to war with a nuclear power over that country's historic territorial claims? The Taiwan question may be of interest and concern for the US, but it's not the top concern of either US leaders or citizens. Conversely, this is an existential issue for China. I'd be very interested to know when and why the US State Department changed its official statement on US-China relations with regards to Taiwan. It begs the question: has the US dropped its one-China policy and opposition to Taiwan Independence? If so, has anyone in authority in the US offered reasons as to why? It might be rather important to clarify this to China and the world. Global Times: Joe Biden said the US and China need to establish ""guardrails"" to ""manage the competition between China and the US responsibly, avoiding competition sliding into war. But the risks of war in the Taiwan Straits are increasing. More China believe that as the Taiwan question is increasingly taking up more and more China's strategic energy?, short term pain is better than long-term loss and support for a military unification is gradually gaining the upper hand in China public opinion. What do you think about it?Taylor: The problem with US thinking is that it's convoluted. While there's no problem with encouraging managed competition, let's understand that this requires polite dialogue and mutual respect. On the one hand, we appear to want guardrails and talk a good game of bilateral cooperation. On the other hand, US actions suggest a more antagonistic approach to China. In this environment, it does nothing but encourage increasingly belligerent rhetoric that could justify a war. Sadly, China public opinion is reflecting this troublesome reality as much as US public opinion. I worry that US public opinion is driving thinking about the People's Liberation Army, comparing it to the Russia Armed Forces. Let me dissuade people of this notion: It is not. The US media and certain political opinion leaders tend to provide a dichotomy when it comes to describing China's armed forces. The PLA is either a paper tiger that can't succeed because it hasn't had combat experience in decades or as a behemoth that will take Taiwan in a day, nuke the US Pacific Fleet, and wreak havoc on the global economy for good measure. Perhaps we should see the PLA for what it is - very similar to the US as a modern military with state-of-the-art weapons systems, a cogent military doctrine, and considerable force projection capabilities that can both defend China and protect its strategic interests. Perhaps that should be enough to provide a bracing splash of ice water to the face that will encourage détente and reduce the pugnacious rhetoric.     Global Times: The US has repeatedly emphasized its commitments to Taiwan. But as seen from the Afghanistan and Ukraine cases, it seems the US is increasingly difficult to keep its commitments to allies. What message do you think is this sending to Taiwan?Taylor: The US performance last year in Afghanistan and its decision to not provide combat support of Ukraine in order to avoid involving itself and NATO in a war with Russia risks its strategic credibility. Combined, these actions undermine the USs ability to foster trust with its allies. Which may explain Joe Biden and Taiwan. Joe Biden's repeated statements and assurances that he wants to defend Taiwan by force are meant to reinforce US credibility with Taiwan. The US has long supported Taiwan's self-defense capability with arms sales and a close military relationship. That message of commitment is being repeated as much as possible by the US in order to allay Taiwanese fears that they could be left to fend for themselves to hold off the PLA at the cost of thousands of lives and potentially millions of people displaced.Global Times: Is the US Taiwan policy too risky currently? Does it have a brake mechanism?Taylor: I'd like to think that there is a brake mechanism, but I'm concerned that US policy is currently stuck in a mind-set that's ""all gas, no brakes,"" driven by politicians in a midterm election cycle and public opinion. The Joe Biden administration has continued a process begun under previous US presidents to slowly dilute the meaning of the one-China policy. Emphasizing the Taiwan Relations Act and the Six Assurances, while ignoring the three joint communiqués between China and the US on Taiwan, is taking US down a path where the common ground upon which the one-China policy was established and maintained is slowly being lost. I'm increasingly worried that we're seeing a move away from peaceful coexistence and toward a Cold War mind-set with regards to China. This mind-set is hell-bent on scapegoating China for certain US societal ills and labeling it as an enemy on a variety of venues from academia to health to smart technology to economics. Make no mistake, if the US nullifies the one-China policy, then the establishment of diplomatic relations with China decades ago loses its legal basis.Global Times: From 1 to 10, how likely do you think a military conflict between China and the US will break out over the Taiwan question?Taylor: I'd like to be optimistic and say 1 - very low probability. The realist in me leans toward 4 to 5, which is still moderate. But with so many ships and planes in the region as well as increasingly antagonistic rhetoric, there is more than an outside possibility that conflict could come, due to mistakes, misreading of intentions, misguided threat assessments, misinterpretation of official statements, and even technical glitches or failure. Continuing along this path inches US ever closer to a war that neither nation really wants and the world can ill-afford. Global Times: How will the Taiwan question influence China-US relations in future? Taylor: While the Taiwan question is one of the most important issues in China-US relations, it's not the only one. Maintaining a functioning global governance structure, trade and globalization, cybersecurity, and cooperation on fighting terrorism, drug trafficking, human trafficking are also important areas for collaboration. Preserving stable relations requires that the one-China principle must remain in place. Yes, the US will continue to support Taiwan in ways that will irritate China. Conversely, China will do things that assert its sovereignty in the Straits that will irritate the US. Responsible global powers can't let such irritations lead to war. Rather, the irritations should be the basis for frank and respectful dialogue between the two nations. We need a reset in China-US relations as soon as possible.",OPINION,VIEWPOINT,Illustration: Chen Xia/GT,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'US': ('LOC', 16), 'China': ('LOC', 16), 'Taiwan Straits': ('LOC', 7), 'Joe Biden': ('PER', 2), 'Yu Jincui': ('PER', 1), 'Jon R': ('PER', 1), 'Taylor': ('PER', 4), 'Donald Trump': ('PER', 1), 'Obama': ('PER', 1), 'UN': ('ORG', 1), 'Global Times': ('ORG', 3), 'Department of Political Science and Geography': ('ORG', 1), 'University of Texas at San Antonio': ('ORG', 1), 'one': ('MISC', 2), 'one China': ('MISC', 3)}"
266,China’s socialist goals a source of inspiration to those who seek a humanist alternative: anti-war socialist,Global Times,2022-07-05,"Editor's Note:  For the China people, the past decade was epic and inspirational. The country, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China (CPC) with Xi Jinping at its core, has made great endeavors in boosting its economy, deepening reforms, improving the rights of its people and acting as a responsible power globally.For Brian Becker (Becker), the national director of the ANSWER (Act Now to Stop War and End Racism) Coalition and founder of and a central organizer for the Party for Socialism and Liberation, the most impressive achievement China has made during the past decade was the eradication of extreme poverty. Becker shared with the Global Times (Global Times) his thoughts on what influence China's development inspires people who seek a socialist and humanist alternative and the reasons behind China's development in the past decade. This is the 12th article of the series about this special decade. Global Times: As the founder of the Party for Socialism and Liberation, what is your take on China's achievements during the past decade under the leadership of the CPC? What changes in China during this period have impressed you the most?Becker: Perhaps the most impressive single achievement during the past decade was the eradication of extreme poverty for more than 850 million people. This was the greatest anti-poverty program achievement in the history of the human race. Another unmistakable achievement was the success of managing the COVID-19 crisis. In the US, where I live, more than one million people have died. More than 60 million workers lost their jobs in 2020. More than 100,000 small businesses were sent into bankruptcy. While the US was plunged into an economic recession and a healthcare crisis of unprecedented proportions, the China government pursued a policy preventing such loss of life inside a country with 1.4 billion people. This would have been impossible had it not been for the policy, guidance, and unified approach of the government. That does not mean that there aren't still significant challenges, but this was a huge achievement. Also, while China has emerged as the 2nd largest economy in the world the leadership of the Party outlined a plan so that economic development was balanced or became more balanced, that efforts to mitigate pollution and climate destruction were affirmed and acted upon and that the goal was to create ""common prosperity."" Finally, China offered a different global vision. The development of the Belt and Road Initiative offered a stark contrast to an economic globalization scheme based on neo-colonialism and the exploitation of the nations in the Global South. Global Times: What influence does the development of China's socialism with China characteristics during this past decade have on the global socialist movement?Becker: In the US and in Latin US today there is a growing revival in the popularity of socialism - especially among tens of millions of young people who want a more just and sustainable world. Growing economic inequality, the danger of climate catastrophe and more war has led millions of young people to seek an alternative to capitalism. China's development of socialism with China characteristics and its attendant social and economic achievements have naturally become a focus of study for people who are interested in or committed to finding an alternative to the current system with its grotesque inequalities, ever-present violence, endless war and looming climate disaster. The fact that the current leadership of the China Communist Party has reaffirmed and re-emphasized China's socialist goals has been a source of great inspiration for people who seek a socialist and humanist alternative. Global Times: China has been enriching the state and strengthening the army, while adhering to a defensive defense policy. As an anti-war activist, how do you understand China's security concept? How does it differ from the security concepts of some West countries?Becker: The contrast between China and the US on the question of militarism, war, military expansionism, could not be greater. Anyone who analyzes the security orientation of the two countries with an objective lens will easily observe a profound difference. The US leads the most formidable military alliance in the world, NATO. It unites 30 countries into a military bloc. NATO is a US-led military formation. US current military spending is $800 billion which is more than double the combined military spending of the other 29-member states in NATO. China is not a member of any international military formation. The US has more than 800 foreign military bases and installations around the world. The US went to war in Korea, Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, Grenada, Panama, Iraq, Yugoslavia, Afghanistan, Iraq for a second time, and Libya. In 2018, the US adopted a new military doctrine prioritizing and preparing for major power conflict which obviously has China as the principal target. Following the 2011 so-called Pivot to Asia announcement the US has redeployed more than 60 percent of its air force and naval assets into the Pacific region. Clearly, the US is actually preparing for military confrontation with China. The current effort in ""strengthening the army"" is clearly a defensive initiative. It would be foolhardy for China to not take the US threat seriously and to upgrade its military capacity in order to defend the country and hopefully to prevent the outbreak of catastrophic global confrontation. Global Times: China President Xi Jinping proposed a Global Security Initiative at this year's Boao Forum for Asia. What do you think about this new initiative? Will it make a notable contribution to establishing a new global order?Becker: The initiative proposed by President Xi Jinping at the Boao Forum is in essence a reaffirmation of the UN founding charter. What makes the initiative very new and fresh is that it highlights the growing danger of war in the current century as compared to the challenges facing the world at the time of the formation of the UN. It highlights the need for the countries of the world to prioritize and work together to avoid war. It makes the argument that the prevention of war is in the interest of all countries. That there should be a shared commitment to work together in cooperation to avoid and prevent war. The analogy used is that all of the countries in the world are sharing the planet the way people on a large ship have a shared and intertwined, common destiny as regards the fate of the ship rather than looking as if they only care about their cabin on the ship. This makes perfect sense. Global Times: You have said that the US is preparing for a war with China and ""hoping that China suffers the same fate as the Soviet Union."" Could you elaborate on that? What challenges does the US pose to the security situation in and around China?Becker: There are two important aspects of this question but they are both very interconnected. The US is obviously planning and preparing for a military confrontation with China. But the goal is not war itself although that could happen. The US goal is to create a process inside of China similar to that which collapsed the Soviet Union. That could only happen if China lost its internal unity. This is the US plan and it's not really a secret: The US seeks nuclear primacy and military supremacy. The goal of this military buildup, naval and air provocations, the secret sending of military forces to Taiwan is designed to raise the specter of the containment or isolation of China. The real goal of the US is to create so much pressure on China that it will lead to political fractures within China with the hope that the government will lose its existing internal unity. It was the loss of unity inside the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU) that led to the tragic and completely unnecessary dissolution of the Soviet Union. US policymakers are operating out of a strategic playbook that is premised on the actual course of events in the 1980s that led to the shocking breakup of the Soviet Union, which - let US remember - was the second largest economy and military power. In the late 1970s and early 1980s the US government embarked on a very aggressive military buildup. The US refused new arms treaties. It placed advanced weapons all around the Soviet Union. The US military budget was nearly doubled. The US launched an effort to gain military supremacy in outer space and end the era of military parity between the two countries. The US consciously created a pressure cooker situation. This created fear inside the USSR that war was coming, and it led to a loss of confidence within the leadership and it aided a political current inside the leadership that sought to appease the US. Failure to properly deal with this aggressive posture and to properly manage political reforms led to the breakup of the unity within the CPSU and ultimately led to a counter-revolutionary overturn. I do not believe this will happen in China. This is an imperial fantasy.  China is well aware of this strategy. But the US is playing a dangerous game by escalating toward war and confrontation and extinguishing the different cooperative parts of the US-China relationships that have existed in the previous 40 years. Global Times: In the last 10 years, it is evident that China has maintained a relatively stable development momentum, while the US' strengths have been significantly eroded and the country has faced increasing chaos and internal conflict. In your opinion, what are the reasons behind China's rise and the US' decline in development? Will the development gap between the two countries become wider and wider in the future?Becker: The US spent more than $2 trillion in the war that it lost in Afghanistan since 2001. In that same two decades the US experienced three major economic recessions. Another fundamental weakness for the US government is that the only vision it offers the world is one of absolute US domination. This is unacceptable to the rest of the world. By constantly employing military threats, invading other countries, carrying out targeted assassinations around the world using drone technology, expanding NATO which made war in Ukraine almost certain, by imposing draconian economic sanctions and seizing the assets of smaller countries the US is diminishing its standing in the eyes of the people of the world. This is a serious blow to US ""soft power."" China has taken an almost diametrically opposed position by emphasizing peaceful cooperation and what the China call a win-win strategy highlighting that interaction with other countries is considered mutually beneficial rather than a relationship based on coercion. US policymakers continue to act and frame their decisions as if they are living in the 19th century where ""might makes right'' and a few countries trampled over the rest of the globe. China is also offering a clear-cut, living proof example of how countries in the Global South can achieve economic and social prosperity and overcome the long, dark era of colonization or semi-colonization.",OPINION,VIEWPOINT,The 20th Chinese peacekeeping force to Lebanon awarded UN peace medal on July 1.

267,The ‘global revolution of dignity' hurts human dignity,Xin Ping,2022-07-05,"""All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights."" This is Article 1 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. But in a recent speech by Administrator Samantha Power of USAID, she seemed to assume that people's yearning for dignity needs to be awakened by the US. If she cares to revisit history, she would find that the so-called revolution of dignity is nothing new. It was chanted by the US before it found its way into Ukraine, Afghanistan and Latin US.""Revolution of dignity"" was used to describe the street protests incited by the US in Ukraine in 2014 that ousted the then president. Regrettably, what ensued was not dignity, but instability and poverty. Eight years later, in the same country, human tragedies repeat themselves. UN Women recently noted that ""women and minorities are facing immense hardship in health, safety and access to food as a result of the Ukraine crisis."" Up to 5,000 children have already been unaccounted for according to the Ukraine authorities. Vulnerability plus the urgent need for money has created a breeding ground for sexual exploitation. UN Secretary-General António Guterres warned that ""for predators and human traffickers,"" women and children are the targets, especially when they cannot speak neighboring countries' languages or don't have people they trust to protect their safety. Human dignity in Ukraine is in dire strait. Yet, US's first lady's visit to Ukraine was nothing more than a photo op, and US humanitarian assistance to Ukraine seems so modest comparing to billions in military aid. Even worse, when the smoke of war is yet to clear in Ukraine, the US is having second thoughts about how much more it should continue to assist. There is no doubt that the US will eventually leave behind a mess the same as it was created, if not worse; and innocent civilians will continue to live in plight with no human dignity. Afghanistan is another place where human dignity is degraded. In 2021, the US withdrew all its troops from Afghanistan, in a manner as arbitrary as how it went uninvited 20 years ago. Back then, president Bush claimed that ""Our coalition has liberated Afghanistan and restored fundamental human rights and freedoms... to all the people of Afghanistan."" Even when the US was pulling out, President Joe Biden still pledged to ""continue to support the Afghan people.""But it is the US who shattered the dignity of Afghan people, when it bombed homes into shambles and tore families apart. The two-decade war left over 70,000 Afghan civilians killed, more than 60,000 injured and 11 million displaced. Nearly 33,000 children died, and 3.5 million lost access to education. Ten civilians including two toddlers aged only two were directly killed by US drones. In a most horrific video, two Afghans who were deluded about a better life in US fell from a US aircraft when it hastily took off from Kabul airport. In neither case was any US personnel held accountable. When human lives hardly matter to the US, there is no human dignity to speak of. The war has cost Afghanistan $60 million on a daily average, destroying almost all its industries. About 72 percent of the Afghan people are living below the poverty line. Only 5 percent of the population have enough food to eat. But the US chose to freeze the Afghan central bank's assets of $7 billion, pushing Afghanistan's financial system to the verge of collapse and leaving more Afghans unemployed. This is how the US defends human dignity: to create turmoil and poverty with a war, and then worsen humanitarian situation with illegal sanctions.""Love thy neighbor."" But that's not the motto of the US when it so casually hurts the interests of Latin US countries to maximize its own profits. On Cuba, the US has imposed the harshest sanctions for more than 60 years, costing Cuba hundreds of billions of dollars. Those wooed by the ideals of freedom and dignity who rushed to the US border would only find the doors shut and their dreams crushed. In early June, tens of thousands of Central US migrants were violently expelled and inhumanely treated at the US southern border. In 2021, a US border guard on horseback whipped a migrant on his head. In just nine days, the US expelled nearly 4,000 Haitian migrants, including hundreds of families with children. Latin US is ""so far from God, so close to the US.""The US keeps talking about dignity, but what it does is just the opposite. Maybe its true purpose is to sustain its dominance and supremacy by depriving others of dignity. Administrator Power said that ""we should extend a broader revolution of dignity to people seeking to be free."" But true dignity can only be realized when the world is free of US hegemony and hypocrisy.The author is a commentator on international affairs, writing regularly for CGTN, Global Times, Xinhua News Agency, etc. He can be reached at xinping604@gmail.com",OPINION,VIEWPOINT,Unmasking the superpower: Where the Ukraine crisis started Illustration: Xu Zihe/GT,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'Article 1': ('MISC', 1), 'Universal Declaration of Human Rights': ('MISC', 1), 'Afghan': ('MISC', 1), 'Samantha Power': ('PER', 1), 'António Guterres': ('PER', 1), 'Bush': ('PER', 1), 'Joe': ('PER', 1), 'USAID': ('ORG', 1), 'UN Women': ('ORG', 2), 'US': ('LOC', 10), 'Ukraine': ('LOC', 8), 'Afghanistan': ('LOC', 5), 'Latin US': ('LOC', 11)}"
268,"NATO’s expansion, ‘going wherever I want’ posture bring instability, confrontations around the world",Wu Yun,2022-07-05,"Editor's Note:Amid the still ongoing Russia-Ukraine military conflict, NATO, which has been adding fuel to the conflict, started a three-day summit in Madrid, Spain, from June 28 to 30. The NATO alliance has been working to increase pressure on Russia over its conflict with Ukraine while underscoring their continued concerns about China. For the first time in history, Japan and South Korea leaders were invited to attend the NATO summit. The militant group which has already been a source of trouble for EU is now trying to create its own Asia-Pacific chapter to interfere in Asia. How did the organization come about? How was it born from the Cold War mentality and gradually became an obstructer of world peace? Why is this military alliance extending its ""dark hand"" to Asia? The Global Times will publish a series of four articles on how NATO is expanding. This is the third installment.The Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers EU of NATO in Mons, southern Belgium, and the NATO Headquarters in Brussels have different duties. The latter gathers diplomatic representatives of NATO members, while the one in Mons is the headquarter of NATO's military operations.In April 2005, when the Global Times reporter visited the Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers EU of NATO, a military officer, a major from the Czech Republic, said ""You are the first China journalist who has ever come here to conduct an interview as far as I know.""At that time, NATO was still making efforts to ease its relationship with China, and by accepting a China journalist to visit was one of the signs.However, a small two-story building at the heart of the NATO campus, which displayed the sign ""Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers EU,"" made the reporter feel extremely sad and indignant - in 1999, NATO's decision to bomb Federal Republic of Yugoslavia as part of the Kosovo War and the later bombing of China Embassy in Belgrade also started from here.The NATO summit that just concluded at the end of June is reversing the course of history. It not only mentioned China in the new Strategic Concept and constantly overstated ""China threat,"" but also invited several Asia-Pacific countries for attendance to create an ""Asia-Pacific version"" of NATO. Such approaches have put people on high alert.Since the end of the Cold War, NATO has been in an active period of engaging in military activities, launching many military operations, and completing the transformation of a military alliance from pure defense to ""defense + intervention."" Today, NATO has assumed a posture of ""going wherever I need to go"" and ""going wherever I want to go,"" and has increasingly become a ""systemic challenge"" that threatens world security and stability.Expanding the West camp

A soldier stands in front of the US ship ""USS Mount Whitney"" anchored at a naval base after the end of the NATO's Baltic Operations maneuver on June 17, 2022. Photo: AFPIn November 1989, the Berlin Wall fell. Two years later, the Warsaw Pact dissolved, and then the Soviet Union collapsed, ending the Cold War. The political pattern of EU underwent historical changes. For this kind of change, in January 1989, then US president George H. W. Bush said in his inaugural speech: ""I come before you and assume the Presidency at a moment rich with promise. We live in a peaceful, prosperous time, but we can make it better. For a new breeze is blowing, and a world refreshed by freedom seems reborn."" Since then, the optimism that ""history has changed"" began to permeate West countries.After the Cold War, even though there were people who said that NATO experienced ""brain death,"" as a relic of the Cold War era, NATO, especially the US, which wanted to lead its EU allies through NATO, seized every opportunity and found various reasons for this military organization to walk the path of transformation and expansion.The establishment of NATO was ""a major event"" in EU history after World War II, marking the beginning of EU's ""grouplization."" Shortly after World War II, EU was divided in two, with two opposing camps facing off each other through the Iron Curtain. The different ideologies pursued by East and West EU have led to political, economic, and military confrontations. But in general, throughout the Cold War period, NATO, which focused on common defense, was somewhat subdued, with fixed defense zones, singular tasks, and remained in a defense status, doing nothing ""outrageous."" Even in 1982, the UK, a member of NATO, and Argentina, fought over the sovereignty of the Malvinas Islands, an archipelago in the South Atlantic known to English speakers as the Falkland Islands. NATO did not activate the fifth article of mutual defense, because the battlefield was outside the NATO defense zone.However, the US, which controls NATO, still gave strong support to the UK, demanding that France break the arms sales agreement previously signed with Argentina and stop the supply of weapons to Argentina. History has proven that NATO's unity is inseparable from ""stick-style discipline.""After the end of the Cold War, a brand new security pattern emerged in EU, but NATO has never discussed the issue of ""leaving,"" but has instead focused on how to ""stay."" The transformation of NATO began by extending a ""hand of friendship"" to former adversaries - the former Warsaw Pact member states. In 1991, NATO established the North Atlantic Cooperation Council (NACC) to engage in dialogue and cooperation with the former Warsaw Pact member states and began to reach out to EU.If we say that during the Cold War, the expansion of NATO was still limited to the interior of the West world, and it still focused on collective military confrontation, then after the Cold War, NATO's expansion began to take on an expansionist nature, which is determined by NATO's political attributes.As a military alliance, NATO is based on West democratic values. The purpose of NATO was to ensure the ""security and freedom"" of its members, and after the Cold War, NATO's focus shifted to taking advantage of the ""peace dividend"" brought about by the end of the Cold War. It used the tendency of Central, Eastern, and Southern EU countries moving closer to the West to expand the West's camp.Today, NATO seeks to expand in all directions, and its strategic transformation aims to involve building global partnerships, adding new functions, breaking through traditional defense zones, and conducting off-zone military operations.'Dark record' of transformationAfter the end of the Cold War, NATO began to reposition itself, taking the so-called ""uncertainties"" represented by regional instability as new ""dangers and challenges,"" and shifted from defending against traditional threats originating from EU to defending against new threats from outside of EU. From EU to North Africa, from Middle East to Afghanistan, all of NATO's military operations took place after the end of the Cold War.The Strategic Concept adopted by NATO in 1999 emphasized, for the first time, that NATO should ""walk out of the defense zone"" and shift from ""collective defense"" to ""intervention"" outside the defense zone, which means that NATO has basically established the principle that ""military action can be taken without the authorization of the UN.""Among them, the so-called ""humanitarian war"" launched by NATO against Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in 1999, or the Kosovo War, blatantly violated the Charter of the UN and the universally recognized norms of international relations. After bypassing the UN, without the authorization of the UN, NATO launched a 78-day bombardment, setting a bad precedent in international relations and causing a severe humanitarian crisis.Then UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan severely criticized NATO's unilateral military actions. He emphasized that, according to the UN Charter, the UN has the primary responsibility of maintaining world peace and security, which was clearly recognized by NATO. Therefore, the UN should be involved in any decision involving the use of force.The famous US linguist and philosopher Noam Chomsky also sternly condemned NATO's military action, saying that its purpose was to build a West neoliberal social and economic system in the country.After the 9/11 attacks, NATO's ""enemies"" changed from fixed to invisible ones, as ""terrorism threats"" became NATO's biggest worry, and anti-terrorism has since become the topmost priority. In response, NATO established the high-readiness Response Force, which not only continued to undertake the collective defense function of Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty but also began to perform military tasks that are not in the collective defense of Article 5, assuming the posture of ""going wherever I need to go"" and ""going wherever I want to go.""On October 7, 2001, as the US-led coalition launched the Afghan war, NATO conducted its first large-scale military intervention outside EU under the 1999 Strategic Concept. In 2003, the US fabricated the lie that Iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction and joined forces with the UK and other NATO allies to launch the Iraq War. The intention of NATO to gradually transform from a military alliance with only regional functions to a political and military alliance that can play a global role became obvious.In 2011, NATO abused the authorization of the UN to launch a military strike against Libya. This is another obvious example of NATO, out of self-interest, conducting foreign military interventions and regime changes after the Cold War. On October 31 of the same year, Anders Fogh Rasmussen, the then NATO Secretary-General, arrived in Libya on a US-made C-130 transport plane, escorted by two France Phantom fighter jets. The surprise visit was the first by a NATO secretary-general to the North Africa country. When top NATO officials announced the end of the ""Joint Protector"" operation against Libya, they would have never thought that tens of thousands of Libyan civilians would be killed in the civil war after NATO's intervention, let alone the country still being largely unstable today.NATO's strategic transformation has greatly exacerbated Russia's insecurity while changing the EU security pattern. After the Russia-Ukraine conflict began, NATO said in a showdown that it would no longer honor its previous commitments to Russia. No military deployment to EU is a commitment NATO made to Russia during its first eastward expansion after the Cold War, and it was also written into the basic document agreed upon with Russia. Now, with NATO's formal completion of accession talks with Sweden and Finland, and the US announcing that it will have its troops permanently stationed in Poland, these actions are bound to further intensify the confrontation between Russia and NATO.The inevitable fall from grace  Analysts pointed out that although NATO claims to be the most powerful military alliance in history, its internal contradictions have always existed. Even after the Cold War, NATO's strategic transformation has not been smooth sailing and has been marred by contradictions between the US and EU countries.Since the 1950s and 1960s, when EU embarked on the road to unity and self-reliance, conflicts between the US and EU countries emerged in the political, economic, and military spheres. This was highlighted by the former France president Charles de Gaulle's withdrawal of France forces from NATO's command in 1966 at the height of the Cold War and later forcing military institutions such as NATO's headquarters and the Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers EU to leave France.Experts noted that with the gradual progress of EU integration, the US and EU have been competing around the issue of the independent defense of EU. In order to maintain hegemony, the US has been strongly opposed to the establishment of any independent defense of EU aimed at weakening NATO, which is strongly resented by some EU countries such as France.In 2003, France and Germany openly objected to the US bypassing the UN to wage a war in Iraq.In 2020, Germany-US relations were negatively impacted by the Donald Trump administration's ""US First"" ethos, leading to increasing conflicts and growing rifts between the two sides in diplomatic and defense fields. US media outlets including the National Interest commented that the two countries have gradually fallen to their lowest points of interaction since the Cold War. France President Emmanuel Macron's comments on ""the brain death of NATO"" and EU's strategic autonomy became the latest manifestation of the existing contradictions between the US and EU under the Donald Trump administration.Currently, the escalation of the Russia-Ukraine conflict has temporarily overshadowed the differences between EU countries and the US, and EU has again become intentionally dependent on the US military umbrella, experts noted. But experts also pointed out that, in the long run, the continued expansion of NATO will inevitably lead to the diversification and decentralization of interests. ""As they send more howitzers and drones to Ukraine, NATO leaders need to pay close attention to the economic and political blowback from the war on their own societies. When they do so, they will better appreciate the need to facilitate a cease-fire and support Ukraine's cause at the negotiating table,"" Charles Kupchan, a professor of International Affairs at Georgetown University, wrote in the Foreign Affairs.Today, NATO is still indulging in a mindset of Cold War and bloc politics, stressing the absolute security of one group regardless of the security interests of the others. The US especially, along with some NATO member states, is trying to expand the circle of influence of West ideology and to find and establish new opponents. NATO's set of operations will inevitably lose the hearts and minds of other countries, the so-called ""most successful alliance in history"" and its decline will become inevitable, experts said.

269,Biden presidency dimmer as mass shooting mars Independence Day,Global Times,2022-07-05,"For US President Joe Biden, the first Independence Day after he took office was bad. The second was even worse. The celebrations in the US were marred by a mass shooting incident on Monday at a parade in Highland Park, Illinois that killed at least six people. Prior to the celebrations, a Harvard CAPS-Harris Poll on Friday showed that 71 percent of respondents polled do not think Joe Biden should run for a second term. 45 percent of those who don't want Joe Biden to seek reelection said it's because he's a bad president. When Joe Biden vowed to usher in ""a time to heal"" after he claimed victory in November 2020, the US people cheered, believing his election ""offered himself as a leader who seeks not to divide, but to unify a country gripped by a historic pandemic and a confluence of economic and social turmoil."" However, a cold reality is the US under the presidency of Joe Biden is closer than ever to the darkest moment. The epidemic in the US is still raging. Inflation has climbed to its highest level in nearly 40 years.Joe Biden grabbed the steering wheel of the US from Donald Trump, but he didn't steer the US back to the right course. Instead, the US has deviated even more. Joe Biden's governance philosophy is morbid. The US incompetent and ineffective response to the COVID-19 epidemic caused chaos in the supply chains and soaring prices. But, instead of seeking to stabilize the global supply chains, the Joe Biden administration banned imports of goods from Xinjiang citing the so-called excuse of forced labor, and it has instigated the Russia-Ukraine conflict, which caused global energy and food prices to skyrocket and has further worsened US inflation.  Still the Joe Biden administration is obsessed with being the ""savior"" of the world. Declaring to allies ""the US is back,"" it has used every possible means to showcase US leadership and made waves overseas especially in EU and the Asia-Pacific regardless of its problems at home. It spent too much attention and energy in rallying allies against Russia by exploiting the Russia-Ukraine conflict and forming small circles to confront China. How can the US public be confident that the Joe Biden administration will devote itself to and be able to address domestic woes?   Some China scholars believe Joe Biden has become a negative asset of the Democratic Party. The Joe Biden administration, which has been in power for less than two years, is facing two major crises. The first is the midterm elections in November. Many analysts believe Democrats are likely to lose control of the US House and Senate, and Joe Biden greatly risks becoming a lame duck president. The second is the 2024 presidential race. Former president Donald Trump has reportedly privately told allies and aides that he is seriously considering announcing a 2024 presidential run as early as this summer. Some predicted there is a big chance for Donald Trump to win. If Donald Trump is reelected, US division will become deeper. It won't be surprising even if there will be a nationwide version of the Capitol Hill riots. Degradation is only just beginning in the US. The US is sliding into a country without a sense of direction. To change requires systemic reform in the political, cultural, economic, and social dimensions. Unfortunately, it seems that no US political figure has the ability to promote and lead such a course. Joe Biden administration has accelerated the decline of the US. More and more people believe that the country that deserves the most of the world's vigilance is the US. US elites tend to deal with internal crises by creating larger external crises. Problems that erupt in the US often could turn into global problems in an instant. It must be said that the US is now the biggest security risk in the world.",OPINION,OBSERVER,"US President Joe Biden falls off his bicycle as he approaches well-wishers following a bike ride at Gordon's Pond State Park in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, on June 18, 2022.

270,"Serious crisis, worse security situation lie ahead as Finland, Sweden advance to final stage of NATO membership",Wang Qi,2022-07-05,"The 30 NATO members signed off on the accession protocol for Finland and Sweden in Brussels on Tuesday, allowing the two Nordic countries to advance toward the final stage of becoming formal and fresh members of the US-led world's largest military club after obtaining the approval of the two countries' memberships in each NATO member state's legislative institutions. China experts said it still takes at least a few months before final membership is guaranteed. The latest development, which signals the end of the two Nordic countries' longstanding gesture of non-military alignment, would pave the way for greater confrontation and division in EU, and the tragic escalation of military conflict is not out of the question.NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg described the day as ""truly a historic moment"" for Finland, for Sweden, for NATO, and ""for our shared security."" Stoltenberg said with 32 members, NATO will be even stronger and people will be even safer, Agence France-Presse reported. The two Nordic nations submitted their NATO applications in May. On Tuesday, Swedish Foreign Minister Ann Linde expressed gratefulness to allies, saying the country's NATO membership would add stability in the Euro-Atlantic area, Agence France-Presse reported. Finnish Foreign Minister Pekka Haavisto said he looks forward to a ""swift ratification process.""Observers predicted that if the process goes smoothly, Sweden and Finland could become full NATO members as soon as the end of this year. If there are some hiccups, such as Turkey's resistance, the Nordic countries' membership would be settled in the first half of 2023, said the observers.The entry of neutral countries like Sweden and Finland into NATO would have a huge impact on regional security, as EU countries which are not NATO members yet could consider joining the military bloc and move away from neutrality, a Beijing-based international affairs expert told the Global Times on condition of anonymity on Tuesday. ""This will not help resolve or ease the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, and may instead magnify tragedy. The greater NATO's presence in EU's independent security framework means more divisions and confrontations are highly possible,"" the expert said. ""NATO is a strategic tool for the US. It is not necessarily in EU's interest, but in US's strategic interest,"" the expert said. And EU seems to be moving in the direction planned by the US. According to a CNN report released on June 29, US President Joe Biden suggested to Finland's President Sauli Niinisto to join NATO in a phone call in December, before the Russia-Ukraine conflict occurred. CNN said ""the efforts to bring Finland and Sweden into NATO were both the work of months.""Analysts said for Russia, the credibility of the US and NATO has already bankrupted NATO. The bloc had promised not to expand beyond Russia's borders, but Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic, former Warsaw Pact members, joined NATO in March 1999, with multiple expansions in the next two decades.During the NATO Summit in Madrid, Stoltenberg said that the decision made in Bucharest on membership for Ukraine was reiterated during the meeting. In the 2008 NATO Summit in Bucharest, Ukraine was first offered to join the military bloc.It seems that the conflict between Russia and Ukraine does not affect NATO's plan to accept Ukraine's membership in the long run, which means tensions between  NATO and Russia will continue to rise, the expert said, ""so a bigger crisis may lie ahead, and the security situation in EU is far from positive.""Russia President Vladimir Putin warned on June 29 that Moscow ""would be obliged to respond symmetrically"" if NATO sets up a military infrastructure in Sweden and Finland, media reported. On June 30, Stoltenberg said NATO has ""a co-responsibility to prevent an escalation beyond Ukraine,"" and ""we will see suffering, damage, and death on a scale we haven't seen yet"" if the ongoing conflict escalates to a war between NATO and Russia.Russia Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said at a press conference on Monday that the US won't ask Finland's opinion if US decides to deploy NATO infrastructure to the country, following Finnish Foreign Minister Pekka Haavisto's remarks that there was no need to deploy NATO forces to the country at the moment, the Russia news outlet Tass reported. The two countries' accession process was initially blocked by Turkey, a NATO member that raised concerns over the fight against terrorism.

271,GT Voice: EU economy heading for tough winter with reduced Russian gas,Global Times,2022-07-03,"An oil pump is seen in Almetyevsky District, Republic of Tatarstan, Russia. File Photo: CFPThe past month of June saw the EU for the first time in history import more liquefied natural gas (LNG) from the US than pipeline gas from Russia, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA), Bloomberg reported Friday.The development, which was mainly attributed to the sharp fall in Russia gas imports to EU, came at a time when the EU is facing a looming energy crisis and soaring inflation as a result of the West's sweeping sanctions against Russia. The fact that US gas exports have emerged as the biggest winner from West sanctions is, to a certain extent, an indication of the EU's resolve to wean itself off Russia energy supplies, which could be a long-term struggle that requires both strong will and great endurance. And the crucial question now hinges on whether the EU economy can support its political will.It is no secret that the EU has been heavily dependent on imports of Russia gas for electricity generation and home heating, among other uses. Over the past years, Russia usually exported about 150 billion cubic meters of natural gas through pipelines to EU on an annual basis, with an additional 14 billion to 18 billion cubic meters of LNG exports. In 2021, Russia's gas exports to the EU accounted for about 40 percent of the bloc's total gas imports.After the Russia-Ukraine conflict broke out, the EU in March agreed to buy an additional 15 billion cubic meters of US LNG this year to displace Russia gas and planned to replace a third of Russia gas with LNG from various sources this year, according to the Bloomberg report. While the US is expected to become the world's biggest LNG exporter in 2022, it is impossible for US LNG to meet the supply gap of pipeline gas from Russia in the short term. A prominent reason is that EU doesn't have the required scale of infrastructure for importing such a huge amount of LNG and it takes time to build those facilities.Moreover, over the past decades, EU countries have been looking for alternative energy sources by developing renewable energy, but oil and gas remain the most important energy sources to this day. It is obviously unrealistic for EU to expect to replace fossil fuel with renewable energy in several years.What's worse, to fight back West sanctions, Russia is unlikely to give EU countries enough time to accomplish their energy shift. For instance, Gazprom, Russia's state-backed energy supplier, has reduced its gas flows to EU by about 60 percent over the past few weeks, according to a CNBC report.Usually EU countries build up gas stocks during summer in preparation for heating demand in winter. But geopolitical changes have disrupted this cycle, meaning that EU's energy supplies will be seriously stretched during the winter, posing severe difficulties for the already struggling EU economy.The key question is whether the economy can sustain itself in this new landscape, especially in some weaker economies. When the cold front strikes, factories and shops may have to shut down again for the lack of gas and oil and many people will lose their jobs. What will households, shop owners, and manufacturers think about the energy crisis, which is bound to be a long-term one? People in EU are simply unprepared for this situation. Surveys in several countries have already revealed their top concerns are rising prices, decreased incomes and unemployment.The EU's sanctions against Russia will eventually become its own economic problem, undermining the coordination within the bloc and the integration process of the EU. The longer the energy struggle between Russia and the EU takes, the worse it is for both sides.",SOURCE,GT VOICE,Picture description not found,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'Almetyevsky District': ('LOC', 1), 'Republic of Tatarstan': ('LOC', 1), 'Russia': ('LOC', 13), 'US': ('LOC', 5), 'West': ('LOC', 3), 'Ukraine': ('LOC', 1), 'EU': ('ORG', 13), 'International Energy Agency': ('ORG', 1), 'IEA': ('ORG', 1), 'Bloomberg': ('ORG', 2)}"
272,"China to contribute wisdom, solution, enhance unity as its diplomacy enters ‘Asian moment’ in second half of 2022",Yang Sheng,2022-07-04,"A series of major regional or global events are scheduled to be held in Asia countries starting this month through to the end of the year, ushering in an Asia moment for their role in global governance, with the upcoming Lancang-Mekong regional meeting in Myanmar and the G20 Foreign Ministers' Meeting in Indonesia in the coming week as well as G20 Summit in Indonesia and the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) meeting in Thailand in November.Experts said China will be prepared to send strong signals of confidence to its key neighbors and partners in the region to further boost economic recovery as well as safeguard unity, peace and security for Asia in a world that faces turbulence and challenges. China also has its own significant political event in the second half of this year, as the Communist Party of China (CPC) is to convene its 20th National Congress to draw China's development blueprint for the next stage, with analysts believing that the top China leader, at the G20 Summit and the APEC meeting later this year, will also introduce China's plan and proposals for the future to contribute wisdom, solutions, hope and certainty to not only Asia but also the world. From July 3 to 14, China State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi will chair the seventh Lancang-Mekong Cooperation Foreign Ministers' Meeting in Myanmar and attend the G20 Foreign Ministers' Meeting in Indonesia, Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian announced on Friday.  On Sunday, visiting Foreign Minister Wang and Myanmar's Foreign Minister U Wunna Maung Lwin agreed to speed up the construction of the China-Myanmar Economic Corridor (CMEC), implement well the cross-border power grids agreement, guarantee the operation of China-Myanmar oil and gas pipelines, explore the ""CMEC plus"" cooperation at a proper time, and elevate the level of bilateral trade and commercial cooperation.The two officials also exchanged views on Lancang-Mekong cooperation and China-ASEAN cooperation. China firmly supports the ASEAN centrality in the regional architecture, and is ready to work with ASEAN to steer East Asia cooperation in the right direction, Wang said.According to Zhao, Wang will also pay official visits to Thailand, the Philippines, Indonesia and Malaysia and host the second Meeting of China-Indonesia High-level Dialogue Cooperation Mechanism.In addition, Wang will chair the 14th Meeting of the China-Vietnam Steering Committee for Bilateral Cooperation and the sixth Meeting of China-Cambodia Intergovernmental Coordination Committee in Nanning, Guangxi, the spokesperson said.China has frequent high-level diplomatic exchanges and communications with members of ASEAN due to the traditional friendship and the close ties of win-win cooperation. In 2022, from the China-Singapore foreign ministers meeting in February, to the visit to China of the foreign ministers of four ASEAN members (Indonesia, Thailand, the Philippines and Myanmar) in late March and April, and the latest visit by China Defense Minister Wei Fenghe to Singapore and his attendance at the Shangri-La Dialogue in June, China has always attached great importance to ties with ASEAN members.  Zhao said China and Southeast Asia countries are friendly neighbors. We are linked by mountains and rivers and share our future together. We are also important partners that share vast common interests and seek common development. At present, mankind's pursuit of peace and development is confronted with strong headwinds in the face of the combined impact of major changes and a pandemic both unseen in a century, he added. ""In a world fraught with turbulence and changes, China and Southeast Asia nations have worked hand in hand to address the challenges, safeguarded peace and stability in our region, and cultivated this region into a most dynamic and promising hub for development,"" Zhao remarked on Friday.Asia moment Asia, including China and ASEAN members, are facing multiple challenges that require joint efforts. Apart from COVID-19 pandemic, the Russia-Ukraine crisis and the US-led West anti-Russia sanctions have deeply interrupted the global supply chains, market and economic order. The US is trying to further its influence in the region by hyping conflicts and tensions, as US wants to engage in a great power competition against China for the region, and has attempted to instigate bloc-to-bloc confrontation in Asia by using its regional allies, experts said. So the ASEAN which prioritizes economic development is now facing serious challenges and desperately needs the certainty, confidence and protection for the members' economies. This will ensure that China-ASEAN ties are even closer because both parties share a consensus over development and multilateralism, and the region has strong confidence in China's development and clear understanding of China's national strength, analysts said. Chen Xiangmiao, an assistant research fellow at the National Institute for China Sea Studies, said that the US will not stand any chance of interrupting the neutral and independent decision-making of ASEAN. Spokesperson Zhao said ""Through the visit, China hopes to deepen strategic communication with the four Southeast Asia countries, work for high-quality Belt and Road cooperation, strive to build a peaceful, safe and secure, prosperous, beautiful and amicable home, inject new impetus into and foster new highlights in bilateral relations, and get the China-ASEAN Comprehensive Strategic Partnership off to a good start."" Analysts said the G20 Foreign Ministers' Meeting is for the preparation and preliminary communication for the G20 Summit in November in Bali. The summit this year will attract high attention from around the globe as it will be the first major meeting of global leaders since the Ukraine crisis started. It is also the first major international event to invite West leaders, the leaders of Russia and Ukraine, as well as leaders of other non-West major economies with a neutral stance. Wang Yiwei, director of the Institute of International Affairs at the Renmin University of China, told the Global Times on Sunday that ""A key mission of the G20 foreign ministers' meeting is to prepare for the leaders' attendance at the summit. By the end of 2022, the G20 and the APEC meeting are scheduled to be held in Asia, and ASEAN will hold its summit as well. China will also have the 20th CPC National Congress. This will definitely make the world focus its attention on Asia, so it's important for China to make the best use of the opportunity to introduce its plans and initiatives for global recovery and world peace and security.""The China foreign minister will also have discussions and dialogues with ASEAN members on the issues that share the concerns of both sides. A key principle for China-ASEAN ties is to focus on economic development, another is the principle of non-interference, so on many sensitive topics including the Myanmar issue, China will not be directly involved. On global hot spot issues that share the concerns of both sides, like the China Sea issue and the Ukraine crisis, China and ASEAN need to deal with the matters via dialogue and coordination, Chen noted. ""So there will be at least two key signals released by China to ASEAN via the foreign minister's visit. First, China's policy toward ASEAN will keep focusing on economic cooperation to realize joint development of the region, especially in handling the impact of the pandemic; second, to reaffirm China's principle of peaceful development and that it doesn't intend to solve problems and disputes by force,"" Chen said, adding that the US and some of its allies are trying to spread groundless concerns and anxiety among the ASEAN members that had disputes with China on sovereignty, Chen said. Especially on the Ukraine crisis, both China and the ASEAN do not want to see interventions from non-regional powers to make regional problems a global crisis; whether in economic or military terms this would be harmful to the global economic recovery, said a Beijing-based expert on international relations who asked for anonymity. The expert noted that ""China's diplomacy in the second half of this year will enter the Asia moment. Asia countries will show the world that they have their own plan and wisdom to address their own development and security issues.""Chen echoed and said that the reason why Indonesia, as the host of G20 summit this year and a key power in the region and ASEAN, has invited Russia President Vladimir Putin under heavy pressure from the West is that ASEAN and China share values in upholding multilateralism and solving conflicts and disputes via peaceful dialogue and the non-interference principle.",CHINA,DIPLOMACY,China ASEAN Photo: VCG,"Reporter, Beijing","Yang Sheng is a chief reporter at the Global Times covering Chinese politics, diplomacy and military.","{'Asia': ('LOC', 5), 'Myanmar': ('LOC', 4), 'Indonesia': ('LOC', 5), 'Thailand': ('LOC', 2), 'China': ('LOC', 11), 'Philippines': ('LOC', 1), 'Malaysia': ('LOC', 1), 'Vietnam': ('LOC', 1), 'Lancang - Mekong': ('MISC', 3), 'G20': ('MISC', 2), ""Ministers ' Meeting"": ('MISC', 5), 'G20 Summit': ('MISC', 4), 'China - Myanmar Economic Corridor': ('MISC', 1), 'CMEC': ('MISC', 2), 'Me': ('MISC', 2), 'East': ('MISC', 1), 'Asia - Pacific Economic Cooperation': ('ORG', 4), 'APEC': ('ORG', 2), 'Communist Party of China': ('ORG', 1), 'CPC': ('ORG', 1), 'National Congress': ('ORG', 1), 'Council': ('ORG', 1), 'Foreign Ministry': ('ORG', 1), 'Laang': ('ORG', 1), 'ASEAN': ('ORG', 3), 'Committee': ('ORG', 1), 'Bila': ('ORG', 1), 'Wang Yi': ('PER', 5), 'Zhao Lijian': ('PER', 2), 'U Wunna Maung Lwin': ('PER', 1)}"
273,"Former Japanese PM criticizes US and Japanese politicians' hype on the Taiwan question, stressing importance of the one-China principle",GT staff reporters,2022-07-04,"Photo: VCGYukio Hatoyama, former Japan prime minister, pointed out that the Japan and the US governments, along with some politicians, have been using the Ukraine crisis to hype the Taiwan question with irresponsible remarks, calling on Beijing and Tokyo to reaffirm the one-China principle as the foundation of the bilateral ties, as this year marks the 50th anniversary of the normalization of China-Japan relations.Hatoyama made a speech at the 10th World Pace Forum held by China's Tsinghua University on Sunday.Since the Russia-Ukraine conflict, many politicians and media in Japan have played up the irresponsible claims that ""China would unilaterally change the current status quo across the Taiwan Straits,"" said Hatoyama, criticizing the Japan and US politicians for hyping the Taiwan question.Now, few people in Japan talk about the difficulties the China mainland would face if the island of Taiwan steps up its ""independence,"" Hatoyama noted.Fifty years ago, the visionary politicians of China and Japan normalized diplomatic relations when the differences in ideology and values between the two countries were much wider than they are today, the former prime minister looked back on the past, noting that ""countries and peoples with different values achieving positive interactions is true diplomacy.""On the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the normalization of China-Japan relations, the China and Japan governments should once again reaffirm one of the big principles of the bilateral relations, the one-China principle, Hatoyama said.Also, Japan government and politicians should not engage in reckless words and deeds that may encourage ""Taiwan independence"" forces as the US does, Hatoyama stressed. If Japan and the US blindly manipulate their so-called values, and separatist forces in the island of Taiwan take inappropriate actions, the stability in East Asia could be destroyed, he warned.If we can manage the Taiwan question well, the tension between China, Japan and the US can be eased and we should be able to avoid the worst tragedy of a war, Hatoyama said.The Japan-China Joint Communiqué of 1972 says that there is only one China and this principle needs to be reiterated between China and the US, as well as between China and Japan, he noted.Under this principle, another Russia-Ukraine conflict would not happen in Asia, Hatoyama believes.In recent years, China-Japan relations have been cooling, with the Japan government and politicians from the ruling Liberal Democratic Party playing on differences in values to fan the flames, Hatoyama said.Japan also actively participates in ""multilateral frameworks"" led by the US, such as the QUAD, IPEF, and the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework, and enjoys the ""virtual containment of China,"" Hatoyama pointed out.If Japan can make concrete efforts to improve its relations with China and bilateral ties can get out of the current vicious spiral, this will be Japan's greatest contribution to world peace, Hatoyama noted.In December this year, the documents of the Japan government on national security might be revised to support the increase of defense spending, which would be a ""very regrettable"" thing as it would add fuel to the already tense China-Japan relations, according to Hatoyama.To improve bilateral ties, the former Japan prime minister called on the leaders from both countries to launch meetings this year.Also, the normal people-to-people exchanges between the two countries should be resumed as soon as possible when the pandemic ebbs, Hatoyama said.Many people in Japan and the US see China as a challenger to the current international order, which is an absurd idea, said Hatoyama, noting that it is obvious that if China were to undermine the current international order, it would lose far more than it would gain.In fact, China is an indispensable and important member that protects the current international order, said Hatoyama.Japan and China should play a leading role in building an East Asia community with a spirit of friendship, the Japan former prime minister said, calling on the two countries to stop the downward spiral in Japan-China relations, manage tensions and achieve improvements.Hatoyama Yukio served as Prime Minister of Japan from 2009 to 2010 and is the current President of the East Asia Community Institute of Japan. During his tenure as Japan prime minister, Hatoyama attached great importance to developing China-Japan relations and made efforts to promote the sound and stable development of bilateral ties, according to the host of the 10th World Peace Forum.",CHINA,DIPLOMACY,Picture description not found,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'VCGYukio Hatoyama': ('PER', 5), 'Hatoya': ('PER', 1), 'Hat': ('PER', 2), 'Japan': ('LOC', 16), 'US': ('LOC', 6), 'Ukraine': ('LOC', 3), 'Beijing': ('LOC', 1), 'Tokyo': ('LOC', 1), 'China': ('LOC', 15), 'Taiwan Straits': ('LOC', 7), 'East Asia': ('LOC', 2), 'Co': ('LOC', 1), 'one': ('MISC', 1), 'World': ('MISC', 1), 'Forum': ('MISC', 1), 'Russia': ('MISC', 2), 'Pace': ('ORG', 1), 'Tsinghua University': ('ORG', 1)}"
274,US changing cross-Straits status quo fearing China’s rise,Global Times,2022-07-04,"Editor's Note:  Since US President Joe Biden inherited the reckless China policy of the previous administration, friction points between China and the US over the Taiwan question have greatly increased. The US is believed to be engaging in a ""cognitive warfare"" campaign with an attempt to blur the fact that Taiwan is part of China by playing tricks such as supporting its participation in the UN system and claiming the Taiwan Straits are international waters. What's the purpose of the US chipping away at the one-China policy? Will US shift from ""strategic ambiguity"" to ""strategic clarity"" over Taiwan? These series of interviews seek to find the answer.The first of the series focuses on which side is really changing the status quo of the Taiwan Straits. Senior Colonel Zhou Bo (ret), who is now serving as a senior fellow of the Centre for International Security and Strategy at Tsinghua University and China Forum expert and Douglas H. Paal, a non-resident scholar at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, shared with Global Times different perspective. Paal's opinion represents mainstream US views, but do not necessarily reflect the objective situation. The purpose of this piece is to present the views of the two sides. The views of the interviewees do not reflect the position of the newspaper.Global Times: US officials said they adhere to the ""one China"" policy at some occasions, but they are increasingly taking concrete actions to hollow out the ""one China"" policy. For instance, the State Department website's section on relations with Taiwan recently removed references on acknowledging that Taiwan is part of China. What do you think of the purposes behind those moves by the US?Paal: I believe the administration's changes represent continuation of the former positions on Taiwan independence and acknowledging Beijing's position in the following highlighted phrase from the second amendment to the website:The US approach to Taiwan has remained consistent across decades and administrations. The US has a longstanding one China policy, which is guided by the Taiwan Relations Act, the three US-China Joint Communiques, and the Six Assurances. We oppose any unilateral changes to the status quo from either side; we do not support Taiwan independence; and we expect cross-Straits differences to be resolved by peaceful means. We continue to have an abiding interest in peace and stability across the Taiwan Straits. Consistent with the Taiwan Relations Act, the US makes available defense articles and services as necessary to enable Taiwan to maintain a sufficient self-defense capability -- and maintains our capacity to resist any resort to force or other forms of coercion that would jeopardize the security, or the social or economic system, of Taiwan.Zhou: The US will always say that it upholds ""one China,"" policy, because this is the commitment of the US government, and 181 countries worldwide recognize the China as the sole legitimate government of China.But since the Donald Trump administration, the US has been taking a salami-slicing approach to hollow out one-China policy in diverse ways, including enhancing exchanges with Taipei, sending warships to sail provocatively through the Taiwan Straits and secretly deploying its servicemen in Taiwan to help with military training. There are many reasons behind all these.First of all, the development of the China mainland's military power has almost become inconceivable for the US. In fact, according to the US' various war games, US does not have much chance of winning within the first island chain, especially in the Taiwan Straits.US' confidence in the face of the mainland's military progress is declining, which brings about strategic panicking. Therefore, whether it is US warships' repeated passage through the Taiwan Straits, or increasing substantial military assistance to the island of Taiwan, or even sending staff to train Taiwan troops, the US has already made a relatively big adjustment in its policy. The US is gradually breaking away from its strategic ambiguity that has characterized US's China policy.Second, the conflict in Ukraine has aggravated some of the US' suspicions that the mainland might one day adopt a similar approach. But the Ukraine crisis and the Taiwan question are two different things. One is a conflict between two countries, and the other is China's sovereignty issue. Our military buildup won't be affected by the Taiwan question. Fully transforming the China People's Liberation Army (PLA) into a world-class military by the middle of the century is our declared clear goal, so this is no secret. But what is a powerful army for? For China, the first is to defend our sovereignty and territorial sovereignty, the second is to defend our expanding overseas interests, and the third is to assume the international responsibilities as a major power. The China military is increasingly fulfilling its international responsibilities. Whether it is peacekeeping, or counter-piracy in the Gulf of Aden, or humanitarian disaster relief, these are all military operations other than war. In other words, all of these operations are for humanitarian purposes. Global Times: The US often accuses China of changing the status quo, but the Taiwan authorities' perception of cross-Straits issues is quite different from what it was when China and the US established diplomatic relations and very different from what it was under the Ma Ying-jeou period. The US has elevated its official ties with the Taiwan island, supports Taiwan island's return to the UN system, are these moves changing the status quo of the Taiwan Straits?Paal: This or that aspect of cross-Straits relations cannot be frozen in time. Changes in political and economic development, for example, need to be realistically accommodated. But the founding principles need to be constant so as not to force the other sides of the Taiwan triangle to seek major readjustment. Recently, unlike at different times in the past, the primary source of change is from the mainland.The general thrust of China military development exceeds anything that might be justified by various actions by the US government regarding Taiwan. China occasionally increases activity such as air and naval surveillance in Taiwan's near abroad in response to things it does not like, and these are significant, but pale in comparison to China's overall militarization of the situation.Zhou: This issue is a typical security dilemma. Both sides believe that the other side is changing the status quo, and both can cite many examples to blame the other. For the China mainland, the US is changing the status quo. A good example is that former US secretary of state Mike Pompeo apparently broke all US promises on the Taiwan question during the end of his term. In so doing, he wished to make the situation as difficult as possible for his successor. Of course, the mainland has to make firm opposition. My understanding is that our response is a kind of warning and countermeasure to show the China mainland's firm determination to safeguard its sovereignty and territorial integrity. But the US does not think so. It thinks we in the mainland are provocative.The US is fundamentally reluctant to see the reunification of the two sides of the Taiwan Straits. I assume the US will never say that it opposes peaceful reunification. But in actual practice, the US definitely supports Taiwan in at least maintaining the status quo of not unifying with the mainland.Global Times: Joe Biden said the US will militarily defend Taiwan if it's attacked by the mainland on several occasions, but every time White House officials immediately denied the US has changed its Taiwan policy. In your opinion, will the US abandon strategic ambiguity and move toward strategic clarity? What consequences will it bring to the Taiwan Straits?Paal: I think ""Strategic ambiguity"" is here to stay, because it serves US interests on the issue. President Joe Biden's statements seem to reflect the widespread perception that the greatest current threat to that ambiguity comes from China's increasing military threat to the area.Zhou: In fact, the US strategic circle has made some discussions over the past year. In the past, the US insisted on strategic ambiguity. It did not make it clear whether it will send troops or not to defend Taiwan. Presumably this can not only prevent the China mainland from attacking the island, but also can prevent ""Taiwan independence."" Therefore, the US believes that this approach is effective. In September 2020, President of the US Council on Foreign Relations Richard Haass and his colleague David Sacks published an article saying that ""US support for Taiwan must be unambiguous,"" ""making it explicit that it would respond to any China use of force against Taiwan. Such a policy would lower the chances of China miscalculation"" and makes China have no illusions and refrain from using force against Taiwan. Such an opinion was criticized by many scholars in the US who think that turning to strategic clarity would make the mainland take action earlier and would make the mainland think that the US deliberately wants to obstruct the reunification of the two sides of the Taiwan Straits, resulting in a situation that the US did not want to see.At the government level, the US has not stated it would change from strategic ambiguity to strategic clarity. But Joe Biden's back-and-forth comments regarding defending Taiwan in a few months are no slip of tongue for US. What is behind this? We have to mull over this question. I believe the US will still verbally support ""one China,"" and will not easily change to strategic clarity. But it should be noted that when the US talked about strategic ambiguity in the past, it had certain confidence. But now the US is worried that China's military capacities are improving, and it believes China's will is growing in the direction of resolving the Taiwan question. However, I think the China mainland's attitude toward Taiwan is actually still the same. The peaceful settlement of the Taiwan question is in the best interests of both the mainland and Taiwan.Global Times: The US has repeatedly emphasized its commitments to Taiwan. But seen from the Afghanistan and Ukraine cases, it seems the US is increasingly difficult to keep its commitments to allies. What message do you think this is sending to Taiwan?Paal: Taiwan's people are smart and observant. I think they can tell the differences between Afghanistan, Ukraine, and their own situation.Zhou: Whether the US commitment to defend Taiwan is credible is actually a question that Taiwan people should worry about. We cannot answer it for residents in Taiwan. Noticeably, there are too many examples that the US has failed its promises. In the Russia-Ukraine conflict, why did the US not send troops to Ukraine? It seems the major reason is that Russia has many nuclear weapons. In comparison, is the PLA weaker than the Russia military? I do not think so. Judging from the current China military power, it is hard to think of any weapon that China should have but not have, from aircraft carriers to hypersonic weapons. Second, China has never engaged in a war since 1979. This invites the question of whether the PLA can fight and win, but few doubt that China's military is much stronger than it was in 1979.Third, long-time peace doesn't mean the PLA lack the will to fight. When our national strength was so poor in the 1950s, we were not afraid and fought against the US on the Korean battlefield due to some geopolitical reasons. Now we have ever stronger combat capabilities. Since the Taiwan question concerns China's core interests and our territorial sovereignty, if a war really breaks out, our resolve will be firm and unshakable.",OPINION,VIEWPOINT,Illustration: Chen Xia/GT,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'US': ('LOC', 12), 'China': ('LOC', 9), 'Taiwan Straits': ('LOC', 15), 'Beijing': ('LOC', 1), 'Joe Biden': ('PER', 1), 'Zhou Bo': ('PER', 1), 'Douglas H.

275,"Chinese, Russian warships approach Diaoyu Islands as Russia ‘sends warning to Japan’",Liu Xuanzun,2022-07-04," Japan's Ministry of Defense hyped on Monday that China and Russia warships were spotted near the Diaoyu Islands in the China Sea almost at the same time earlier in the day. China and Russia vessels have the right, albeit different, to freely navigate in the contiguous zone of the Diaoyu Islands of China, experts pointed out, saying that the Russia Navy's recent military activities in the West Pacific is a warning to Japan amid Japan sanctions on Russia over the Ukraine crisis.A Russia frigate entered the Diaoyu Islands' contiguous zone from 7:05 am to 8:16 am on Monday, and a China frigate sailed in the same area for about six minutes from 7:44 am, Kyodo News reported on Monday, citing the Japan Defense Ministry.The China frigate involved is a Type 053H3 frigate, equipped with YJ-83 anti-ship missiles, HHQ-7 air defense missiles and 37-millimeter-caliber guns, according to a press release by the Japan Defense Ministry. Japan has ""lodged a protest"" with China after the incident, which was the first time since June 2016 when China and Russia naval vessels had been spotted entering the contiguous zone at around the same time, Kyodo News said.Zhao Lijian, a spokesperson of China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said at Monday's regular press conference that the Diaoyu Islands and its affiliated islands are China's inherent territories. China vessels' maritime activities in waters off the islands are fully legitimate, and Japan has no right to make irresponsible accusations, he said.Tian Shichen, founder of the Global Governance Institution and director of the International Center for the Law of Military Operations, told the Global Times on Monday that a contiguous zone overlaps with an exclusive economic zone, which means foreign warships have the right to navigate freely in any country's contiguous zones as long as they abide by the domestic laws set by the coastal country in accordance with international law.China and Russia warships can freely navigate in the Diaoyu Islands' contiguous zone, but on different legal bases, Tian said.The China vessel navigated in the China contiguous zone over which China has sovereign rights and jurisdiction, while the Russia vessel navigated in the area freely because of the right of free navigation in any contiguous zone in accordance with international law, Tian explained.It is an act of safeguarding national sovereignty that China warships patrol and monitor the Diaoyu Islands, Zhou Yongsheng, a professor at the Institute of International Relations at China Foreign Affairs University, told the Global Times on Monday.According to press releases by Japan's Ministry of Defense Joint Staff, a number of Russia warships circumnavigated Japan in June.Zhou said that Russia, which is having a military operation against Ukraine, has island disputes with Japan, and Russia naval activities in the West Pacific aim at deterring Japan from taking reckless moves.Russia's recent moves serve as a warning to Japan amid Japan sanctions on Russia, and aim to ease West pressure on Russia because of the Ukraine crisis, analysts said.",CHINA,MILITARY,File photo taken on a marine surveillance plane B-3837 shows the Diaoyu Islands and nearby islands.Photo:Xinhua,"Reporter, Beijing",Defense reporter at the Global Times covering weapons and military development.,"{'Japan': ('LOC', 6), 'Russia': ('LOC', 7), 'Diaoyu Islands': ('LOC', 5), 'China Sea': ('LOC', 15), 'West Pacific': ('LOC', 1), 'Ukraine': ('LOC', 1), 'Di': ('LOC', 1), 'T': ('LOC', 2), 'Ministry of Defense': ('ORG', 1), 'Russia Navy': ('ORG', 1), 'Kyodo News': ('ORG', 2), 'Defense Ministry': ('ORG', 1), 'Japan Defense Ministry': ('ORG', 1), 'of Foreign Affairs': ('ORG', 1), 'Global Governance Institution': ('ORG', 1), 'International Center for the Law of Military Operations': ('ORG', 1), 'Global Times': ('ORG', 1), 'Type 053H3': ('MISC', 1), 'YJ': ('MISC', 1), 'H': ('MISC', 1), 'Zhao Lijian': ('PER', 1), 'Tian Shichen': ('PER', 1)}"
276,"As romance gives way to weariness, Europe lays bare its true attitude toward Kiev",Global Times,2022-07-04,"It started as a tight bond that the two sides feel deep emotion toward each other. In less than five months, the strong emotion has given way to a feeling of tiredness.Dmitry Medvedev, Russia UN deputy chairman, suggested on Telegram on Saturday that the ""stormy romance"" between Europeans and Ukrainians is coming to an end. According to him, EU is tired of refugees, as well as the topic of the Ukraine crisis.Medvedev's remarks mirror an evolving situation between Ukraine and EU. EU has provided aid to Ukraine, including accepting Ukraine refugees and offering military assistance. But there is no sign of a ceasefire in the Russia-Ukraine conflict and ordinary people in many EU countries have suffered from a number of social issues triggered by a record high inflation and a flood of refugees fleeing conflict in Ukraine, said Song Zhongping, a China military expert and TV commentator. Furthermore, many Europeans think it is difficult to meet the constant demands from Ukraine for aid.Against this backdrop, many Europeans increasingly see Ukraine as their burden, which they feel difficult to carry on. They are starting to feel Ukraine fatigue or war fatigue, which means the ""honeymoon"" between EU and Ukraine is drawing to a close, said Song.""It wouldn't be bad if Ukrainians remembered their former love for the inexperienced guy in the green shirt. And, for their own good, they should end that marriage forever as soon as possible,"" added Medvedev.Both sides are in an awkward situation. Apparently, NATO will not grant Ukraine membership. Except for EU candidate status, Ukraine has gained little in its relationship with EU. EU's snobbish manner toward Ukraine means that they are not soulmates. When there is growing weariness against Ukraine within EU, it is time that Kiev ceases its unrequited love.Many Europeans' war-weary sentiment has attracted wide attention. If the military conflict continues and expands, EU will be forcibly involved in a war, which regional countries are reluctant to see. Additionally, more Europeans feel antipathy against US's hegemony and underline EU's strategic autonomy. If the war is prolonged, it will arouse a confrontation between Russia and NATO. In that case, it would mean a nuclear war in EU cannot be ruled out.Song noted that many EU countries have been aware that in regard to the Ukraine crisis, although the US has provided some assistance, it has done nothing. What the US has done is primarily to exploit Ukraine to contain Russia, and control EU. Many EU countries have already been frustrated with the US over the Russia-Ukraine crisis and do not want to become a pawn of US once again.What the UK, another party that is keen to extend the conflict, has done is more lip service than practical moves just like the US. In March, the UK was heavily criticized as it only issued around 50 visas to Ukraine refugees. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said in June that Ukraine refugees face being sent to Rwanda if they travel to the UK without authorization.An anonymous China expert told the Global Times that the Ukraine crisis will not end in a short time. The US and UK are taking advantage of the ongoing Ukraine crisis to dominate the construction of the EU order as well as the global order. It is the specter of the pursuit of hegemony that has triggered the US and the UK to exploit EU and NATO to such an extreme degree.In this context, France and Germany, two major EU powers that have repeatedly been calling for strategic independence, cannot sit idly. They must play their due role as regional great powers and cannot allow US and London to trample on EU interests, said the China expert.",OPINION,OBSERVER,Deputy Chairman of the Russian Security Council Dmitry Medvedev Photo:VCG,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'Dmitry Medvedev': ('PER', 3), 'Song Zhongping': ('PER', 3), 'Russia': ('LOC', 3), 'Ukraine': ('LOC', 15), 'China': ('LOC', 1), 'Kiev': ('LOC', 1), 'US': ('LOC', 3), 'UN': ('ORG', 1), 'Tel': ('ORG', 1), 'EU': ('ORG', 13), 'NATO': ('ORG', 2), 'Europeans': ('MISC', 5), 'Ukrainian': ('MISC', 2)}"

278,"Independence Day overshadowed by inflation, public anger over incompetence of Biden administration",Chen Qingqing,2022-07-03,"Planned protests over the Roe v. Wade decision, canceled fireworks in cities due to shortages of staff and supplies and unprecedented high costs for July 4 cookouts… all these cast a cloud over this year's Independence Day in the US due to deepened divisions in US society, economic woes and major failures in the Joe Biden administration. While a latest survey found that more than 70 percent of US do not want Joe Biden to run for a second term, China experts believe the cascading crisis that the Joe Biden administration faces has been escalating, casting a shadow over the upcoming mid-term elections and risking dragging US society into a prolonged chaos and recession. Instead of consulting the professionals in tackling problems like surging inflation, the Joe Biden administration appeared to be disconnected from reality, showing little efficiency in responding to public demands and instead shifting the blame to other countries such as Russia and China, some experts said. They noted that such a chaotic and incompetent policy-making process will only make the situation worse, adding to uncertainties over how Democrats will fare in the midterm elections and making the second half of US President Joe Biden's term even more difficult.Public outcry In Texas, some women are using the Independence Day holiday to protest the overturning of Roe v. Wade. Activists in Arizona are damning Independence Day itself in the wake of the Supreme Court's decision to overturn the ruling and hundreds of protesters in Pennsylvania slammed this decision as part of the Independence Day rally, according to US media reports. US people are angry not only over the abortion ruling, which has been widely described as a historical regression, but also over endless gun violence in spite of the recent federal gun control legislation. At least four people are dead and 18 others are wounded following shootings across Chicago this weekend, CBS reported. As the country witnessed a growing number of gun violence incidents this year, the cost of buying insurance protection against mass shootings has also spiked by over 10 percent, Reuters reported on Wednesday, citing insurers. The festive mood for Independence Day was also affected by surging inflation, as ordinary US people now have to spend more on a good, old-fashioned barbecue. With the cost of burgers, chips, soda and side dishes on the rise, they will be spending a lot more to keep up this tradition than they did last year, CNBC said. ""Independence Day is often a special holiday to boost morale and national identity, but now due to the confusion in values in the US, it will also be a day to unveil the deep pain of many people,"" a Beijing-based expert on US affairs who preferred not to be named told the Global Times on Sunday.This year's celebration will not be very popular among US people, and is likely to be miserable, he said, noting that such a gloomy atmosphere would also be amplified by the widely shared disappointment toward the US government, he said. Seven in 10 US say they do not want Joe Biden to run for a second term, according to a new poll that comes as Joe Biden's approval numbers remain low and his party braces for losses this November, the Hill reported on Friday. Among the respondents who believe the president should not run, 45 percent said Joe Biden should not make another bid because he is a bad president, while about a quarter said it is time for a change, according to the media report. ""The public outrage is apparent now, as the Joe Biden administration has not made any progress over the past year and a half in solving the dilemma that led to cascading crises from gun violence and the revocation of abortion rights that has caused even deeper society divisions,"" Diao Daming, associate professor at the Renmin University of China, told the Global Times on Sunday. Although the overturning of Roe v. Wade may serve as stimulus to vote for Democrats, currently, the US public is much more concerned about the economy and employment, Diao said, noting that in the face of the worsening situation, Democrats are highly likely to lose both Congress and the Senate in the upcoming election. IncompetenceIn some US cities, the dark skies over Independence Day will not be illuminated by fireworks as there is a nationwide shortage of pyrotechnicians. Meanwhile, travelers across the country are seeing their flights canceled as pilots from major airlines protest at several airports across the country amid contract negotiations, US media reported. More than 4,500 US domestic and international flights were delayed Friday as the holiday weekend started, Newsweek said, citing FlightAware data. Faced with a major economic woe - inflation - the Joe Biden administration has not yet made up its mind to remove tariffs against China, despite officials and experts suggested that lifting those tariffs could take 1 percent off inflation. Instead, it continued to shift the blame for its domestic dilemma onto other countries such as Russia and China. Joe Biden assured US that inflation remains his top priority, after price increases unexpectedly hit a new 40-year high in May, but again sought to blame his biggest political liability on the Russia-Ukraine crisis, Bloomberg reported on June 11. All three branches - the executive, legislative, and judicial - of the US government are encountering problems now, for example, the executive branch appeared to be extremely chaotic and inefficient given that Joe Biden's decision-making process has been relying on staff he is familiar with and sidelining the professionals, Lü Xiang, research fellow at the China Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times on Sunday. ""Without professional policy-making, confusing measures ensue. Joe Biden also lacked the fundamental understanding about why inflation happened,"" he said, noting that the situation casts doubt on him running for a second term and exposes his incompetence given the record low popularity ratings.   As Joe Biden debates whether to lift Donald Trump-era tariffs on China imports, his cabinet is split over a politically fraught issue that could influence the November congressional midterm elections, the Financial Times reported on Sunday. Officials and experts familiar with the debate say there are deep divisions in the administration, partly reflecting the fraught politics over China trade issues, according to the FT. ""The policy-making of the Joe Biden administration is disconnected with reality, not only on tariffs but also on the Ukraine crisis. He claimed he would 'back Ukraine as long as it takes'. Such an irresponsible remark should not come from a responsible major power,"" Lü said, asking that if the crisis drags EU down, what good will it bring to the US? The latest CNBC survey showed some 68 percent of chief financial officers expect a recession to occur during the first half of 2023, echoing the forecast by China experts on the outlook for US. ""The incompetence of the Joe Biden administration has become beyond imagination,"" Lü said.",CHINA,DIPLOMACY,"Abortion rights advocates gather and march outside the Hamilton County Courthouse in Cincinnati, Ohio on July 2, 2022 after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v.

279,"Beware, RIMPAC brings back Cold War specter to Asia-Pacific region: Global Times editorial",Global Times,2022-07-02," US, which is busy with the ""diplomatic show"" of the G7 and NATO summits at the Atlantic Ocean, launched a ""military show"" in the Pacific Ocean. The RIMPAC (Rim of the Pacific) 2022 led by the US began on June 29 and will continue until August 4. This year, a total of more than 25,000 personnel from 26 countries are participating in the world's largest multinational maritime military exercise and the deployment of unmanned systems, fighter jets, and large-scale warships has reportedly set a record. The RIMPAC was a product of the Cold War, and the imaginary enemy at that time was the Soviet Union. Some US media said the target of RIMPAC is self-evident, which is China that has not been invited. Many US and West analysts have said this military exercise is to send a message to China - ""China's expansion in the West Pacific region will be obstructed and defeated."" Perhaps they wish to rename the ""Rim of the Pacific"" to the ""Rim of China"" to better deter China. But everyone knows that this is self-deceit of the US and several of its followers, and it does not represent the collective attitude of the 26 countries participating in the exercise.A Southeast Asia military officer who participated in the exercise likened the RIMPAC to a party at sea. It must be the real thought of many participating countries. From another point of view, this shows that they are only here to participate in a party, not to be drawn as a member to oppose or confront another country. It is not difficult to see that most countries are consciously keeping a distance from the anti-China actions of the US. This constitutes a paradox: the bigger the scale of RIMPAC and the more countries participating, the more the directionality and the military and political significance expected by US will be weakened. It is turning into more of a farce.The target newly set up by the US for the RIMPAC is a false one. Where does ""China's expansion in the West Pacific region"" come from? One only sees that the US is increasing its intervention in the region. This time, the US invited a number of China Sea claimant countries. Its intention to stir up trouble and sow discord in the China Sea is obvious. But few countries are willing to follow US in the muddy waters of ""geopolitical competition."" The Russia-Ukraine conflict has given US more excuses to get its hands on the Pacific. The US Navy's press release publicly declared that the military exercise aims to ""deter and defeat aggression by major powers across all domains and levels of conflict,"" which is almost a replica of Tokyo's so-called ""Ukraine today, Taiwan Straits tomorrow"" rhetoric. However, in the past few years, NATO conducted numerous military exercises and deterrence against Russia, which only intensified contradictions but did not ""frighten"" anyone. What's more, the situation around the Taiwan question is completely different. No matter how much bluffing external forces make, their speculative mentality in the Taiwan Straits is vulnerable to the will and determination of the China People's Liberation Army.Unlike in the past when the joint exercises were mostly attended by Pacific countries, nearly half of the 26 countries participating in this year's exercise are NATO members or partners. Japan and South Korea, which were just invited to participate in the NATO Summit as the bloc's partner countries in the Asia-Pacific region, have shown an active attitude this time. South Korea not only sent its largest military force since its first participation in the exercise in 1990, its amphibious assault ship ROKS Marado will also be deployed. The participation of Japan's destroyer Izumo for the first time after it was converted into a light aircraft carrier is also eye-catching. The greatest destructiveness of the RIMPAC is reflected in the poisoning of the atmosphere of regional peace, and the eventual degree of damage will depend on the immunity of countries in the Asia-Pacific region to the US Cold War clamor.Although it wants to use ""great power competition"" to muddy the waters of the Pacific Ocean, the hegemonic power of the US is limited, so it uses the method of ""wooing one faction and fighting another."" As long as most countries do not follow the US, its various irresponsible behaviors will face more constraints. Otherwise, the atmosphere for peace and development, not only in the Asia-Pacific region, but even the world, will be ruined by the US. Regional countries and even the international community must always maintain a high degree of vigilance toward this as well as toward the RIMPAC.",OPINION,EDITORIAL,"International Navy ships assemble for a photo exercise off the coast of Hawaii during the Rim of Pacific Exercise (RIMPAC) 2018, on July 26, 2018 in the Pacific Ocean.

280,South Korea’s trade deficit may continue while surplus with China keeps narrowing: expert,Global Times,2022-07-02," South Korea's trade deficit may continue as commodity prices remain high in the wake of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, harming the South Korea economy which relies heavily on imports of raw materials.South Korea logged a trade deficit for the third consecutive month in June, with faster growth in imports than exports, government data showed Friday.Per data from the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy, the trade deficit amounted to $2.47 billion in June. It has been in the red for three months since April and has shifted from a surplus of $4.37 billion in the same month a year earlier.It marked the first time in 14 years that the country registered a trade deficit for three months in a row and the country's trade gap for the first half of the year, at $10.3 billion, is also the biggest on record.The data is alarming as South Korea, the world's No.8 trading nation, had managed to keep a whole-year trade surplus for 13 years up to 2021. It also came as a senior South Korea official talked of ""decoupling with China"" talk during his visit to EU, sparking a wave of criticism. Earlier this week, Choi Sang-mok, senior presidential secretary for economic affairs, said at the NATO summit that South Korea should reduce its reliance on China for exports, which some analysts read as a sign that the administration is veering away from China in terms of the economy.Experts said the advisor's remarks reflected a desire among some in South Korea to be less dependent on China in terms of supply chains. But it remains to be seen if such efforts will work. The international division of labor and global supply chains have been formed by economic principles over decades, not politics, they noted.South Korea's overall exports remained strong, with major categories such as semiconductors, steel, batteries and bio-products all doing well. However, an 87.5 percent increase in energy imports wiped out the trade surplus. In June, exports to China declined 0.8 percent year-on-year, while exports to the US jumped 12.2 percent.Zhang Huizhi, vice dean of the Northeast Asia Studies College at Jilin University, told the Global Times on Thursday that South Korea's narrowing trade surplus with China was due to China's improved economic strength, which means a growing number of mid-range products no longer needed to be sourced from South Korea.According to data from China's General Administration of Customs, China's trade deficit with South Korea narrowed by 21 percent in the first five months this year in yuan terms.According to South Korea customs data, South Korea saw the first single month trade deficit with China, its largest trading partner, in May. A sharp 40.9-percent-incresase in China-made semiconductors was believed to be behind the reverse. Amid the US tech crackdown, the China mainland's semiconductor industry has made progress and for the first time the country's three top chipmakers - SMIC, HuaHong and Nexchip - accounted for more than 10 percent of global foundry revenue in the first quarter of 2022, according to media reports. Experts said that to cope with the complex global situation in the post-virus world, cooperation should be deepened rather than weakened for big trading nations such as China and South Korea.",SOURCE,ECONOMY,China South Korea Photo:VCG,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'South Korea': ('LOC', 10), 'Russia': ('LOC', 1), 'Ukraine': ('LOC', 1), 'China': ('LOC', 8), 'US': ('LOC', 1), 'Northeast Asia': ('LOC', 1), 'Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy': ('ORG', 1), 'EU': ('ORG', 1), 'NATO': ('ORG', 1), 'Choi Sang': ('PER', 1), 'mok': ('PER', 1), 'Zhang': ('PER', 1), 'Ji': ('PER', 1)}"

282,Three Chinese airlines to purchase nearly 300 Airbus aircraft,GT staff reporters,2022-07-02,"Three state-owned airlines - China Southern, Air China and China Eastern - announced on Friday a deal with France-based Airbus to buy 292 aircraft valued at around $37 billion in total.It is the second time China has signed such a big deal since China leaders visited EU in March 2019, when Airbus signed a deal worth tens of billions of dollars to sell 300 aircraft to China.In spite of disagreements between China and EU from time to time in political areas, the economic and trade ties remain tight and are mutually beneficial, China observers said.China Southern Airlines said it has signed a deal for 96  worth a total of around $12.25 billion.Hours later, Air China announced a deal for 96  worth around $12.21 billion. China Eastern Airlines announced a deal for 100  priced at around $12.79 billion.The carriers said the new orders, which are expected to be delivered from 2024, will help increase their flying capacity and meet the renewal needs as older aircraft are retired.China Southern said the aircraft will increase the group's flying capacity by 13 percent, and Air China said the deal will help increase flying capacity by 10.4 percent.""It is a release of years of pent-up demand,"" market watcher Qi Qi told the Global Times on Friday, adding that the big purchase shows China's market potential and also the airlines' confidence in the recovery of the China aviation market.Although the aircraft will be delivered within four to five years, the deal will barely be enough to meet the demand, said Lin Zhijie, another market watcher.It is a necessary move given China's colossal civil aviation market, Cui Hongjian, director of the Department of EU Studies at the China Institute of International Studies, told the Global Times on Friday.The EU economy has been hit hard by COVID-19 pandemic and the on-going Russia-Ukraine conflict, so the order represents good news, Cui said, adding that China and EU have formed a good cooperative foundation in the civil aviation industry.In May this year, top leaders from China and France held a phone conversation discussing cooperation in traditional fields, and the two sides agreed to enhance exchanges in nuclear energy, aerospace, artificial intelligence and clean energy. Boeing, the main competitor for Airbus, has struggled to win a big order from China recently. The last large deal was in November 2017 when China signed a purchase deal with Boeing for 300 aircraft. It came when US President Donald Trump visited China, and the order value was more than $37 billion.Since then, Sino-US relations have become more complicated and Boeing also lost confidence in the market due to crashes. Its best-selling B737 MAX has so far failed to return to service in China and has not received new orders. There have been some small orders, such as in May 2022, when China Eastern said it would introduce 38 aircraft, including four Boeing 787s.Airbus told the Global Times on Friday that it now has a market share of 53 percent. In 1995, its market share in China was only 9 percent.Cui said China's civil aviation market remains open and China airlines' cooperation with Boeing and Airbus has remained generally balanced as far, but it needs to be pointed out that the devastating plane crashes involving B737 jets have undermined the market's confidence toward the plane maker.The world's two largest aircraft manufacturing giants, Boeing and Airbus, respectively released their 2021 aircraft delivery transcripts. Airbus delivered a total of 611 commercial aircraft to 88 customers last year, an increase of 8 percent from 2020, maintaining its position as the world's largest aircraft manufacturer for the third consecutive year. Boeing delivered 340 planes, about half as many as Airbus, but also recorded a significant increase compared to 2020, up 117 percent year-on-year.With the gradual lifting of the 737MAX flight ban globally, deliveries of the 737 series have rebounded significantly, but the Boeing 787 Dreamliner has been hit by manufacturing problems and delayed deliveries.",SOURCE,ECONOMY,A320NEO aircraft,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'China Southern': ('ORG', 2), 'Air China': ('ORG', 3), 'China Eastern': ('ORG', 1), 'Airbus': ('ORG', 3), 'EU': ('ORG', 4), 'China Southern Airlines': ('ORG', 1), 'China Eastern Airlines': ('ORG', 1), 'Global Times': ('ORG', 2), 'Department of EU Studies': ('ORG', 5), 'China Institute of International Studies': ('ORG', 1), 'Boeing': ('ORG', 2), 'France': ('MISC', 2), 'COD': ('MISC', 1), '19': ('MISC', 1), 'China': ('LOC', 12), 'Russia': ('LOC', 1), 'Ukraine': ('LOC', 1), 'US': ('LOC', 1), 'Qi Qi': ('PER', 1), 'Lin Zhijie': ('PER', 1), 'Cui Hongjian': ('PER', 1), 'Donald Trump': ('PER', 1)}"
284,Spillover effect of US financial tightening sends Asian currencies tumbling,Global Times,2022-07-01," The spillover effect of US financial tightening has continued to push Asia currencies down this week, with the South Korea won falling sharply. China experts warned of risks from US monetary policies - which have shifted from being extremely loose to tightening in order to fight inflation - and suggested countries should take long-term measures in response.  Having depreciated by nearly 8 percent year-to-date, the South Korea won fell to its weakest level since July 2009 at 1,299.65 won to 1 US dollar on Thursday. Several other Asia currencies, including the Philippine peso, were also at their weakest level in over a decade. The peso was trading at 55.01 per US dollar on Thursday.The Japan yen was trading at 136.37 yen per US dollar on Thursday, its weakest level since the 1998 Asia financial crisis.Li Tianguo, associate professor at the National Institute of International Strategy, told the Global Times on Thursday that capital has begun to flow back to the US as a result of the Fed's interest rate hike, and this means the financial market stability in Asia countries will be put to the test. The debt burden will also be increased as countries are forced to raise their own interest rates following the US rate hike, which will hinder economic recovery.The impact of US financial tightening has continued to ripple across Asia, prompting central banks from developing economies in Asia to hike interest rates to contain the outflow of capital and prevent the depreciation of local currencies. Global credit conditions have turned more negative and will be tighter for the rest of the year amid rising borrowing costs, the prospect of a protracted Russia-Ukraine conflict, materially slower growth of the world economy and surging prices of energy and commodities, Moody's Investors Service said in a research note on Thursday.Imported inflation could also become a bigger problem with rising commodity prices and a likely decline in Asia countries' exports to the US due to waning demand, Li said.A report by the World Bank in April warned that a monetary policy shock in the US from a sharp rise in interest rates could hit developing Asia economies, curbing growth by as much as 0.4 percentage points in Malaysia and 0.7 percentage points in Thailand.",SOURCE,ECONOMY,"A currency trader passes by screens showing the Korea Composite Stock Price Index (KOSPI), center, and the exchange rate of South Korean won against the US dollar (right) at the foreign exchange dealing room of the KEB Hana Bank headquarters in Seoul on June 15, 2022.

285,FM denounces NATO as having blood of world's people on its hands after it smears China as ‘systemic challenge’ in new ‘strategic concept’,Wang Qi,2022-07-01," China on Thursday expressed strong opposition and denounced NATO, after the US-led military alliance vilified China's development as ""systemic challenges"" in its newly released ""strategic concept"" for the first time, which means Beijing was targeted as one of NATO's ""strategic priorities for the next decade."" Despite Russia being defined as the ""most significant and direct threat"" by NATO during the two-day summit in Madrid, China, which is viewed as Russia's ""ally"" by the West, was also among the targets of NATO's smear campaign. Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said at a Thursday press briefing that NATO's so-called new strategic concept document disregards facts, smears China's foreign policy, makes irresponsible remarks on China's normal military development and national defense policy, incites confrontation and smacks heavily of Cold War mentality  and ideological bias.China has always been a force for world peace, a contributor to global development and a defender of the international order, Zhao said. ""China has never invaded any country, never launched proxy wars, nor joined or formed any military blocs.""NATO, by contrast, poses systemic challenge to world peace and stability, Zhao said, noting that NATO claims to be a regional defensive organization, but in fact   is waging wars in various countries in the world and killing innocent civilians. ""NATO has the blood of their people on its hands,"" Zhao said. ""China people will never forget that 23 years ago when the US-led NATO committed the crime of bombing the China Embassy in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, and now NATO is extending its tentacles to the Asia-Pacific region in an attempt to export the Cold War mentality and replicate the bloc confrontation in Asia.""For the first time in history, leaders of Japan and South Korea joined the NATO Summit and expressed interest in underpinning a security alliance with the US' West allies. A 23-minute three-way summit between US, Japan, and South Korea was also held. Japan media Kyodo News said the three leaders agreed to boost security cooperation over the Korean Peninsula issue. South Korea and Japan leaders also participated in a four-way summit with Australia and New Zealand leaders on Wednesday for the first time. In the ""strategic concept"" document, China mainly appears in paragraphs 13 and 14. The rhetoric in paragraph 13 stresses ""China threats"" in terms of military build-up, cyber operations, technologies and supply chain. While in paragraph 14, NATO said the bloc ""remains open to constructive engagement"" with China.   ""Paragraph 13 which stressed competition and confrontation with China is more about US ideas, while  paragraph 14 reflects the will of some of NATO's EU members,"" a Beijing-based expert told the Global Times on condition of anonymity.""There is a complex situation of confrontation and engagement with China in the current process of NATO transformation. And if NATO's EU members do not take the initiative to exert influence over the US, they will become a tool of US manipulation against China,"" the expert said. Lü Xiang, an expert on US studies and research fellow at the China Academy of Social Sciences, further explained that for all its bluster and hostility toward Russia and China, NATO's ""strategic concept"" does not even spell out what EU will do if the Ukraine crisis spills over.NATO's vilification of China serves as a backdrop to the success of the China system and their anxiety about own system's ""institutional failures,"" Lü said. Shen Yi, a professor at the School of International Relations and Public Affairs of Fudan University, said that NATO's warning against China in its new ""strategic concept"" feels like ""a big-sized psychopath shouting your name.""""The document seems to assume that the world belongs to NATO.  But NATO's situation is like what the UK Prime Minister suggested to other leaders at the G7 meeting - be shirtless and ""show our pecs."" But he seems to have no well-shaped pecs to flex, Shen said. Even if the Taiwan question was not mentioned directly in the new ""strategic concept,"" NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said after presenting the strategic document that China is ""bullying its neighbors, threatening Taiwan,"" AP reported. Experts warned that given the increasing importance of the ""Taiwan card"" in the US Indo-Pacific strategy, it's likely that US would wield influence over NATO to manipulate the Taiwan question and even create a crisis, and concentrate the resources of NATO's EU members in the Asia-Pacific region.Any attempt to undermine peace, stability, solidarity, and cooperation in the Asia-Pacific region will be opposed by the China people and people of other Asia-Pacific countries, and will be doomed to fail, Zhao Lijian said. NATO should immediately stop making groundless accusations and provocative remarks against China, abandon the outdated concept of zero-sum game, renounce its blind faith in military might and misguided practice of seeking absolute security, and abandon dangerous acts that stir up EU and the Asia-Pacific, Zhao said.",CHINA,DIPLOMACY,NATO alliance shows cracks under a weakening US leadership.

286,US and the West's claims of representing the 'global community' yell out their hegemonic mentality,Shen Yamei,2022-07-01,"As the Russia-Ukraine conflict continues, the US and the West have imposed successive rounds of sanctions on Russia, and taken advantage of public opinion to make it ""the will of the majority"" of the world. But in fact, the West is just a part of the international community, which it should recognize as the sum of all the sovereign nations who participate equally in the discussion and governance of international affairs. The US and the West do not represent the international community. The narrative of the US and the West does not equal world opinion. Under the banner of the ""international community,"" the US and the West have made up a set of narratives in the Ukraine crisis, packaging their own demands as ""international opinion.""For example, the US and the West say that Russia's military action against Ukraine ""has shaken the foundations of international order,"" but the global community generally believes that the US-led NATO's adherence to cold war thinking and continued eastward expansions are the threat to the international order and the reason for the intensification of the Ukraine crisis. The US concocted the ""democracies vs autocracies"" narrative, which has long pushed countries with different systems, including some of the US allies, to the opposite side. It does not even represent its own allies. The position of the US and the West is not that of the international community. Instead of reviewing its own faults and responsibilities regarding NATO expansion and EU security issues, the US has dragged its allies into ""group fights,"" confusing right and wrong.But the US has no way to represent the West or the world. Many allies are increasingly at odds with the US over the perception of the ""Russia threat"" and arms assistance to Ukraine, which has weakened US mobilization capabilities. The US-proposed different solutions to the Ukraine crisis have all focused on how to perpetuate the crisis, which clearly contradicts the international community's call for a peaceful, diplomatic solution to the conflict as soon as possible. There is no ""united camp"" of the world against Russia. International sanctions should be strictly in accordance with the UN Charter, authorized by the UN, with clear objectives, provisions for periodic review, and conditions for lifting them. But the US has consistently imposed sanctions under its domestic law, executive orders, and even customary law, including the sanctions against Russia after the outbreak of the Russia-Ukraine conflict.However, only about 30 allies have followed US sanctions against Russia, while most countries oppose unilateral sanctions and advocate a negotiated solution. Some countries, considered US's partners, such as India and Israel, did not side with the US and the West to provide weapons to Ukraine or impose sanctions on Russia. A wide range of countries from Asia, Africa, and Latin US are generally making their own choices independently. For many nations, Russia is one of the world's largest exporters of oil, gas, wheat, and fertilizers, as well as a strategic partner, security guarantor and source of weapons. Most countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin US maintain strong economic and political ties with both the East and the West. For them, non-alignment and not taking sides help keep the diplomatic door open and better protect their interests. Developing countries are too familiar with the history of West interventions, invasions, staged coups, and ""color revolutions."" Many of them have long seen through the West's misdeeds and do not believe that it is doing justice for Ukraine, and thus have not joined the ""anti-Russia camp."" Some countries, seeing the way the West freely seizes Russia dollar assets, become more aggressive in seeking to establish alternative payment mechanisms that can bypass US and West manipulation.  The US and the West's claim to be the ""international community"" is essentially a reflection of the hegemonic mentality and the mindset of West centrism. In the view of some US and West politicians, the West world is the center of the global community for which they set the rules, and in the name of which they can engage in coercive diplomacy. They have constantly clashed with the interests of the rest of the world because of their sense of superiority, making it difficult for them to find a path to peaceful coexistence with others. The history and reality of the 21st century prove that the era of US dominance is far gone. In this new era, justice and rules are not defined by the US and the West, which need to dialogue with the international community on an equal footing. The author is director and associate research fellow with Department for US Studies, China Institute of International Studies. opinion@globaltimes.com.cn",OPINION,VIEWPOINT,Illustration: Liu Rui/Global Times,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'Russia': ('LOC', 8), 'Ukraine': ('LOC', 7), 'US': ('LOC', 16), 'West': ('LOC', 8), 'NATO': ('ORG', 2), 'EU': ('ORG', 1), 'UN': ('ORG', 2), 'Charter': ('MISC', 1)}"
287,Yoon admin caught in US-designed 'Asian war of attrition': South Korean scholar,Global Times,2022-07-01," Editor's Note:Since the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and South Korea 30 years ago, the two countries have developed into a strategic cooperative partnership and are promoting a high-level relationship. But after taking office this May, South Korea President Yoon Suk-yeol has shown a strong willingness to follow the US in containing China which threatens China-South Korea relations. Global Times (Global Times) reporter Yan Yuzhu talked to Woo Su-keun (Woo), head of the Institute of East Asia Studies of Korea, about his opinion toward the US involvement in the China-South Korea relations, the future of the partnership between the two East Asia countries, and the security mechanism needed for the Korean Peninsula. Global Times: NATO is gradually increasing its penetration into the Asia-Pacific. Some people think that the US could replicate the Ukraine crisis in Asia. Do you think South Korea, Japan and the island of Taiwan could be the ""Ukraine of Asia?""Woo: The most important thing is that force must never be used. From this point of view, the situation in Ukraine is very regrettable. There is a lot of debate around the causes of the situation in Ukraine, but there is a China saying ""There are no waves without wind,"" and a Korean saying ""There is no smoke without fire."" I believe that the conflict should be largely attributed to the US strengthening its efforts to contain Russia. What eventually led to the outbreak of the crisis is the US provoking the relationship between Russia and Ukraine by manipulating NATO's eastward expansion behind the scenes in order to maintain its own interests. There is no guarantee that such a scenario will not be repeated in Northeast Asia. There are similarities between the regional situation before the Ukraine crisis and the current situation here in Asia. For example, Ukraine ended up being the biggest casualty as a third party caught in the middle of the confrontation between the US as the provocateur and Russia as the defender. In Northeast Asia, the Korean Peninsula, as a third party, is likely to become a victim between the provocateur, the US, and the defender, China.Thus, it seems that the top leader of South Korea should not be overly biased between China and the US, but should try to carry out balanced diplomacy, improve relations with North Korea, and avoid war in Northeast Asia through China-South Korea cooperation. However, it seems that the Yoon administration is still caught in the pattern of the US-designed ""Asia war of attrition,"" which makes people feel quite anxious. Global Times: US President Joe Biden chose South Korea as his first stop on his first trip to Asia after taking office. South Korea's new President Yoon Suk-yeol said during his campaign that more US THAAD missile deployments were possible. Some people believe that China-South Korea relations will enter a downward spiral, do you agree? To what extent will the relations decline?Woo: There is a Korean proverb that says, ""You can tell what a tree looks like by observing its leaves."" What the diplomacy of the Yoon administration will pursue can be seen by the people he has promoted to key positions in the government's diplomatic security. Over the past 30 years, I have studied in China, the US, and Japan, lived in many countries, and now I often interact with people from all over the world, making me one of the few experts in South Korea on Northeast Asia. Some of my opinions were commented that ""I have never heard of similar views, but the more I listen to them, the more I feel that they are calm and reasonable thoughts.""I have some friends in the field of South Korea diplomacy and security. Many of these friends lamented the personnel arrangement in their field of the Yoon administration, saying, ""How can there be so many pro-US people who always follow the old ways?""I am a Korean. For me, the national interests of South Korea are more important than anything else. For the sake of the national interests of South Korea, it's necessary to build a close relationship with China. South Koreans often say ""personnel arrangement is the first of everything."" How can South Korea adopt a more balanced and calm diplomacy between China and the US through these pro-US officials?I think it is very unfortunate that China-South Korea relations will inevitably deteriorate, and it is very worrying that the deterioration will be probably at a rapid pace before the Yoon administration realizes its mistakes. But thankfully, there are many South Korea people who sincerely hope for improvement and further development of China-South Korea relations even when they are tending to be worse now. 


Woo Su-keun Photo: Courtesy of Woo Su-keun Global Times: Quad is considered to be a mini-NATO in Asia targeting China. South Korea is also considered a potential member of Quad. What are South Korea's considerations, and will it eventually join this paramilitary alliance against China?Woo: South Korea is aware that Quad is an anti-China coterie against China. Nevertheless, the Yoon administration has given various reasons in trying to join the mechanism. This demonstrates the distrust of those in power in South Korea toward China and their intention to hold China back, as well as their prejudice and lack of understanding against China.It can now be said that the key officials in charge of foreign affairs and security in the Yoon administration are trapped in an outdated way of thinking. They are familiar with the ""one-sided"" foreign policy based on the so-called South Korea-US-Japan trilateral security cooperation during the Cold War, and they have been working in the field of South Korea diplomacy and security for decades based on this perception. As the old saying goes, ""It is difficult to change one's nature,"" and their global consciousness is still bound by the ""unforgettable US."" Moreover, it is difficult to find among these people a proper understanding and appreciation of China today. Their minds are still filled with outdated memories of bad relations between the Korean Peninsula and China, and that China is an untrustworthy country with territorial ambitions for the peninsula. ""Ignorant and rash people are the most dangerous."" They who have just come to power have not only stubborn understanding but also inexhaustible enthusiasm to lead South Korea's diplomacy back to the Cold War pattern according to their own will, regardless of the changes in China and in the world.  Global Times: August will soon mark the 30th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and South Korea. These 30 years have witnessed both the economic take-off of each country and the great progress of bilateral relations. Can the economic ties between the two countries basically guarantee the sanity of bilateral relations?Woo: There is no need to emphasize the importance of the economy in people's lives, but the economy is not everything in life. If our lives are seriously threatened, then we should pay more attention to security than to economy. The economic ties between China and South Korea are the same. Based on economy, both countries can realize mutual benefit and a win-win situation. However, if the two countries become confrontational at the national security level, not only could the solid economic ties be affected, but it would also be hard for them to function and fully ensure that both sides remain rational. There were regrettable situations between China and South Korea over the THAAD missile issue； there is no need to say more. Global Times: What breakthroughs have been made in China-South Korea relations in the past decade?Woo: The bilateral relations have grown by leaps and bounds since the establishment of the diplomatic relationship. Trade has grown rapidly, with China becoming South Korea's largest trading partner and South Korea becoming China's third largest trading partner; social and cultural exchanges have developed rapidly, with each country becoming one of the largest sources of tourists for the other, and moving closer to the other on all fronts. But the deployment of THAAD in 2016 has chilled the relations, and both sides felt a strong sense of disappointment toward each other. After Moon Jae-in took office, relations between both countries have slowly begun to improve, although they have not returned to the desired level. However, the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic at this critical time has made it difficult for people to travel between the two countries, and the trend of improving bilateral relations has tapered off. Recently under the Yoon administration, the bilateral relations may fall into a rapid deterioration unprecedented since the establishment of diplomatic relations. However, there is a saying that ""there's no making without breaking."" Despite the inevitable downward bilateral relationship, the two countries may take the period under the Yoon administration as an opportunity to once again feel the value and importance of each other, reflect on the impact of the deterioration of relations, and seek together to build a more friendly and close future.Global Times: South Korea is an important part of the US plan in terms of the supply chain. The first thing Joe Biden did in South Korea this time was to visit the Samsung chip factory. But it is not in South Korea's interest for the US to control the supply chain. How can South Korea ensure its economic security and independence within the US-South Korea alliance system?Woo: The US is building its supply chain to defend its own interests, and is creating a sharp confrontation with China as a result. Therefore, South Korea should never make a decision lightly as its active participation in the US supply chain plan could damage its relationship with China. China, both in terms of economic and national security, is significant to South Korea. But China is the country that has the most influence over North Korea. It's clear to anyone with common sense that it's not in South Korea's national interest to ignore the relations with China or to be hostile to China. Meanwhile, South Korea's new government wants to further strengthen the South Korea-US alliance. But considering the current situation in Northeast Asia, such an idea is very worrying, as the alliance will eventually lead to rivalries and sharper tensions, which are dangerous for South Korea's national security. Both sides of an alliance must have a common enemy. Specifically in the South Korea-US alliance, the common enemy is undoubtedly considered to be China. But at the moment, China is not only no enemy to South Korea at all, but a crucial neighbor. The Yoon administration needs to undergo ideological innovation in line with the spirit of the times. The security of the country cannot always rely on the South Korea-US alliance alone. The wisdom of keeping up with the times should be kept in mind to build a new national security system that is the opposite of the Cold War era.  Global Times: Former president Moon Jae-in made a lot of efforts to promote reconciliation between South Korea and North Korea. Under the Yoon administration, how do you think the South-North relations will change?Woo: Yoon's policy toward North Korea is unrealistic. At the same time, the international community and North Korea are taking realistic actions. It's normal to urge North Korea to abandon its own ideas and work together for security and prosperity through greater cooperation with the international community. But what is known is that North Korea will not easily give up as long as the national security threat it faces does not disappear. Thus, the foundation of mutual trust should be built in the process of dialogue with North Korea. It's believed that North Korea will also reduce provocations and promote reconciliation to a certain extent. Yoon's unrealistic policies have poured cold water on the efforts of both countries on the peninsula, and the relationship has sharply become tense. The unstable situation in Northeast Asia will lead to social chaos and economic depression in South Korea. As a South Korea, I have no idea what good this will do to the national interests. But the US will be happy about it, and Japan will laugh silently. Global Times: China President Xi Jinping proposed the Global Security Initiative in April this year, calling for common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security. What kind of security mechanism do you think is needed on the Korean Peninsula? Is the South Korea-US-Japan security cooperation system still adaptable to today's Korean Peninsula?Woo: New mechanisms, instead of the trilateral security cooperation, should be adopted since the situations have changed after the Cold War, and China should not be regarded as an enemy by South Korea. Of course, for the sake of national security, South Korea has the motivation to make use of the South Korea-US alliance and the trilateral security cooperation, which, however, have a more negative effect on China's national security. Increasing one's own national security should not be done at the same time as compromising that of others. I hope the new government will pay attention to this. I believe that South Korea should not blindly engage in strengthening South Korea-US-Japan trilateral security cooperation, but should make efforts to adjust its functions while taking into account the national interests of South Korea today and the possible negative effects of the security cooperation involving the US on Northeast Asia. At the same time, South Korea should further promote its dialogue and cooperation with China in terms of national security.",OPINION,VIEWPOINT,Yoon Suk-yeol Photo: Xinhua,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'China': ('LOC', 8), 'South Korea': ('LOC', 7), 'US': ('LOC', 9), 'East Asia': ('LOC', 5), 'Korean Peninsula': ('LOC', 2), 'Pacific': ('LOC', 1), 'Ukraine': ('LOC', 7), 'Japan': ('LOC', 1), 'Taiwan': ('LOC', 1), 'Russia': ('LOC', 3), 'Northeast Asia': ('LOC', 7), 'North Korea': ('LOC', 1), 'Yo': ('LOC', 1), 'Yoon Suk': ('PER', 1), 'yeol': ('PER', 1), 'Yan Yuzhu': ('PER', 1), 'Woo Su': ('PER', 2), 'keun': ('PER', 1), 'Global Times': ('ORG', 2), 'Institute of East Asia Studies of Korea': ('ORG', 1), 'NATO': ('ORG', 2), 'Korean': ('MISC', 2)}"
288,China to give subsidies to domestic oil refining companies to cut costs for real economy,Global Times,2022-06-29," China will give phased price subsidies to domestic oil refining companies in a bid to safeguard stable supplies of processed oil and reduce the operating costs in the real economy, according to a statement published by the Ministry of Finance (MOF) on Wednesday. The subsidies will be issued when international crude prices surge above the upper limit of China's processed oil price stipulated by the government, which stands at $130 per barrel, the statement noted.With the subsidies, the price of processed oil won't increase at the market end. China's oil price has repeatedly increased this year against the background of surging global energy prices amid the Russia-Ukraine conflict. On June 14, China's processed oil price rose for the 10th time this year, with the price of gasoline rising 390 yuan ($58.2) for each ton.According to the MOF statement, the policy's duration time is temporarily set at two months. If international crude prices continue to remain higher than the upper limit of China's stipulated processed oil price, China will arrange relevant regulatory policies in response. The subsidies will be calculated every 10 working days, and the subsidy amount will be based on companies' actual sales volume of gasoline and diesel oil.Global oil prices have continued to show a rising tendency, particularly after leaders of the Group of Seven (G7) nations said recently they will explore a potential ban on transporting Russia oil that has been sold above a certain price as a kind of sanction against the country.  The Brent Crude Oil Continuous Contract rose by 0.43 percent to $114.29 per barrel by 10:31 am on Wednesday, according to the latest data displayed on marketwatch.com.",SOURCE,ECONOMY,CNOOC's oil and gas extraction facility (Photo/CNOOC),Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'China': ('LOC', 6), 'Russia': ('LOC', 2), 'Ukraine': ('LOC', 1), 'Ministry of Finance': ('ORG', 1), 'MOF': ('ORG', 2), 'Group of Seven': ('ORG', 1), 'G7': ('ORG', 1), 'Brent C': ('MISC', 1), 'Oil Con': ('MISC', 1)}"
289,"Kishida, Yoon debut at NATO, casting shadow on Asian peace",Wang Qi,2022-06-29,"For the first time in history, leaders of Japan and South Korea joined the NATO Summit in Madrid on Wednesday to express their interest in underpinning a security alliance with the US' West allies, following an ""unprecedented"" tough stance against China in a joint statement released after the G7 leaders' meeting wrapped up in Germany on Tuesday.On Wednesday, NATO members approved a ""new Strategic Concept for the Alliance,"" setting out the priorities, core tasks and approaches for the next decade. NATO official website said that the document defines Russia as the ""most significant and direct threat"" to Allies' security, while addressing China for the first time and the challenges that Beijing poses toward Allies' security, interests and values.China is closely paying attention to the three-way summit between US, Japan and South Korea on the sidelines of the summit, in which the Korean Peninsula issue will be discussed along with NATO's Asia expansion against China. As for China's two neighbor, China experts warned that guiding the way for the US-led NATO into Asia-Pacific at the expense of diminished diplomatic autonomy will not serve economic and security interests in the long run, and will no doubt exacerbate regional confrontation and division. Citing a government official, the Yonhap News Agency reported Tuesday that South Korea President Yoon Suk-yeol will pledge to start a new cooperation program with NATO in the second half of 2022 and will set up a mission to NATO in Brussels. Japan Prime Minister Fumio Kishida said on Sunday at the G7 Summit that the group should form a united front to prevent other countries ""drawing the wrong lessons,"" from the Ukraine crisis, a veiled shot at China, the Japan Times reported. Similar to the G7 leaders' meeting, the NATO Summit was described by some West media as an occasion to embrace confrontation with China, after NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg recently said the summit would directly address China for the first time, not just Russia. Earlier this month, US national security advisor Jake Sullivan said China ""will feature in the communiqué in a more robust way than we've ever seen before,"" the Guardian reported. Offensive move Prior to the NATO Summit, China was already high on the agenda of the G7 meeting. In the joint statement released on Tuesday, China was addressed 14 times in this year's communiqué compared to four mentions in the 2021 edition. The joint statement hyped China's internal affairs like Xinjiang, Hong Kong, as well as the Taiwan question, groundlessly criticizing China for alleged ""economic coercion"" and ""forced labor.""China Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said at a Wednesday press briefing that the G7, accounting for only 1/10 of the world population, is not qualified to represent the world, and not eligible to take their values and standards as universal ones.The G7 used its post-summit communiqué to advocate ""democracy against authoritarianism,"" grossly interfered in China's internal affairs, attacked and discredited China and incited confrontation, Zhao said. ""This fully shows that the G7 has no intention of conducting dialogue and cooperation on the basis of equality and respect. Instead, it adheres to the Cold War mentality, adheres to ideological prejudice and pursues bloc politics based on the interests of small groups.""The G7 members have benefited the most from globalization and are supposed to promote globalization and world economic growth… However, at a critical time for the international community to fight COVID-19 and recover, the G7, instead of seeking unity and cooperation, is keen on creating division and confrontation, without any sense of responsibility or morality, Zhao noted. The G7 summit opened Sunday in Schloss Elmau amid protests as hundreds of people took to the streets in the southern Germany town, the Xinhua News Agency reported. In Madrid, thousands of demonstrators rallied on Sunday to call for peace and protest against a NATO summit to be held this week, Xinhua said. Wang Yiwei, director of the Institute of International Affairs at the Renmin University of China, told the Global Times on Wednesday that as some EU countries are gradually adopting a mindset of confrontation, the so-called unity within allies is offensive and aggressive to others. China should be on guard against the trend of the US and its allies to hype the ""China threat"" theory, as well as US's new plan, Wang said. The US is turning globalization into a bloc-oriented globalization, Wang said. He explained that in the economy and supply chains, the US emphasizes so-called resilience, safety, autonomy and control, and in the security sphere, security with allies to counter ""China and Russia's threats"" is stressed. The Asianization of NATO is the US' way to reintegrate its alliances in Asia, which used to be a ""hub-and-spoke"" system centered on the US, but now it wants to strengthen intelligence and science and technology cooperation within allies, Wang said. Different calculationThere is nothing new with the cliché rhetoric of the G7, behind which is the intention of escalating the situation and offering excuses for NATO's Asia expansion at the NATO Summit, Da Zhigang, director of the Institute of Northeast Asia Studies at the Heilongjiang Provincial Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times on Wednesday.NATO's Asia expansion is the ultimate goal of Tokyo and Seoul, as the two are betting that after the Russia-Ukraine conflict, collective security defense would become ""mainstream"" under the US' peddling, Da said. On Tuesday, Stoltenberg announced that NATO reached a deal to admit Finland and Sweden after a last-minute deal was made with NATO member Turkey to support the Nordic nations' membership, media reported.  South Korea politicians may believe closer ties with NATO means greater deterrence to Pyongyang, but Seoul's defense moves will inevitably provoke North Korea, which could launch more nuclear and missile tests, escalating the tensions, Da noted. Due to the unpleasant wartime history in the World War II, Japan actually does not much trust the US although they are allies in defense, Da said. ""Therefore Japan wants to use NATO to drag its EU members into the situation in northeast Asia, saving the cost and sharing the risks of a confrontation against Russia and China,"" Da said.Even so, the complex interweaving of interests in international politics means that the economic and security order within the US-led bloc needs a long period of convergence and coordination, analysts said.Japan and South Korea, in their first appearance at NATO, seemed to have lost their independence by courting the US too much, and only they themselves know whether the two Asia heads of state are getting enough respect after flying long hours to boost support for US President Joe Biden, a Beijing-based expert told the Global Times on condition of anonymity. In one of the group photos of the G7 leaders circulating online, the Japan Prime Minister was blocked by UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson, which caused strong dissatisfaction among Japan net users.In a video clip posted by Korea Herald reporter Yim Hyun-su on Twitter with the words: ""When someone you think is your bestie doesn't acknowledge you at a party,"" South Korea leader Yoon, smiling and nodding his head, was given a ""no look handshake"" by Joe Biden. Yim's video is trending in South Korea and some described it as ""pathetic."" Describing NATO's possible Asia expansion as ""setting the wolf the keep the sheep,"" the expert said participation in US-led organizations is more about serving the interests of US, which has long been advocating  ""US first.""Japan and the South Korea should stick to the bottom line when it comes to their China policies. After all, the three nations are geographically close neighbors, but also highly complementary to each other in their economies. Following the US to contain China is clearly detrimental to Tokyo and Seoul's security and economic interests and is unwise, the expert said.",CHINA,DIPLOMACY,"South Korean President Yoon Suk-yeol (left), US President Joe Biden (center) and Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida attend a trilateral summit at the IFEMA Convention Center in Madrid on June 29, 2022.

290,"More risks, conflicts ensue as NATO formally invites Finland, Sweden to join after Turkey lifts veto",GT staff reporters,2022-06-30," NATO formalized its invitation to Sweden and Finland to join the alliance on Wednesday after the last minute agreement was made between Turkey, Finland and Sweden to allow the two Nordic countries to join the bloc. Analysts said that the negotiations are a bargain for Turkey but will not bring security assurance to Finland and Sweden as NATO's expansion will bring more risks and conflicts to the region with less buffer zone with Russia.NATO has formally and collectively decided to approve the countries' applications to join after Turkey dropped its objections Tuesday, paving the way for NATO's most consequential enlargement in decades, CNN reported.  The decision will now go to the 30 member states' parliaments and legislatures for final ratification. NATO's leaders said they expected the process to move quickly, allowing for an unprecedentedly swift accession, according to the report. It came after NATO said on the eve of NATO's summit in Madrid in Spain on Tuesday that a trilateral deal had been reached between the leaders of Turkey, Finland and Sweden. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg was cited by media as saying that the three countries have signed a memorandum that addresses Turkey's concerns, the Guardian reported. Turkey had opposed the two Nordic countries' bid to join NATO citing concerns of their lax approach toward groups that Turkey has deemed as security threats. For example, Turkey has accused Sweden for harboring members of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) while Sweden denied the accusation.Turkey's demands for NATO are clear, including requiring Finland and Sweden and other West countries to stop supporting  PKK, openly condemning it and deeming PKK and the People's Defense Units as ""terrorist organizations""; and demanding the EU to lift arms export restriction, Liu Zuokui, a research fellow on EU studies at the China Academy of Social Sciences (CASS), told the Global Times.Turkey also urged the US to lift sanctions on it to buy S-400 missile defense systems from Russia and include Turkey in the US' sales list of F-35. Turkey also wants to buy new F-16 fighters to reinforce its air force, said Liu. The expert noted that NATO cannot immediately agree with all of Turkey's demands as divergences on these issues have been accumulating for a long time. Turkey is dissatisfied with the unfair treatment from the West during its integration to the West world. ""But as Turkey had dropped its opposition, it may reach consensus with NATO members and Finland and Sweden on the timetable to solve the problems on the list,"" Liu said, noting that the West and the US' recent efforts in coordinating and persuading Turkey also showcased Turkey's status and increasing influence.  According to the Turkey presidency statement released on Tuesday, a four-way agreement has been made between Turkey and Finland and Sweden and the two countries will have ""full cooperation with Turkey in the fight against the PKK and its affiliates"" and they would lift their restrictions on selling weapons to Turkey, according to Al Jazeera. While NATO officials boasted the Tuesday agreement shows the alliance had resolved its differences, observers said that it has not - Turkey's open opposition is an epitome of complicated and jagged frictions within NATO and the recent incidents may also damage trust among NATO members and affect its decision-making system. Liu pointed out that the US and West's consistent criticism of Turkey and their interference in Turkey's affairs by using human rights excuses have led to increased anti-West sentiment in the country. Turkey's relations with Russia not only bring it huge economic benefits but also geopolitical room to seek greater international influence especially after the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Turkey's ""balanced diplomacy"" between the West and Russia and bargaining to seek its own interests may set an example to other NATO members, which may bring more difficulties for NATO to deal with internal frictions, Liu said. The leader of the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia (LDPR) and Chairman of the State Duma Committee on International Affairs Leonid Slutsky was quoted by TASS as saying that Sweden and Finland joining NATO is their choice, but these Nordic nations must realize the consequences this will have on their ties with Russia. Dmitry Medvedev, deputy chairman of the Russia UN, was also quoted by newspaper Argumenty i Fakty in an interview published Tuesday that Russia will station ballistic missiles and nuclear weapons on its border if Sweden and Finland are allowed to join NATO, and that Ukraine membership of the military alliance could trigger World War III.Liu noted that Finland and Sweden's joining NATO will allow NATO to fortify its eastern and northern flanks, making the buffer zone with Russia greatly shrink. And with more members in NATO, the risk of having conflicts with Russia has increased which may go against Finland's and Sweden's seeking security assurance.Analysts also noted that the two Nordic countries may also soon join the Baltic countries - Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania--in worrying about NATO's ""tripwire"" approach since NATO's relatively small number of troops would see these countries overrun before NATO takes measures to assist after 180 days, according to media reports. They noted that NATO attaches more importance to the interests of its 12 founding members and other countries either in the Baltic region or Nordic region may be sacrificed to protect the founding members in West EU.",CHINA,DIPLOMACY,"Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan (L, front) observes a military exercise in Izmir, Turkey, on June 9, 2022.

291,NATO’s steering wheel in the wrong hands of Washington,Global Times,2022-06-30,"Editor's Note:NATO, which is constantly looking for imaginary enemies and justifying its existence by inciting confrontation, is holding a summit from Tuesday to Thursday, and it also plans to extend its tentacles to the Asia-Pacific region. Behind its aggressive narrative, contradictions and divisions within NATO have become increasingly prominent. The Russia-Ukraine conflict is not going according to NATO's playbook. This series of articles will provide some clues regarding NATO's predicament. In the sixth and last piece, Global Times (Global Times) reporter Yan Yuzhu talked to Dr. Jenny Clegg (Clegg), a UK-based senior lecturer in Asia-Pacific studies, peace and anti-war activist, and author of China's Global Strategy: Towards a Multipolar World, about EU's attitude toward NATO and the problems exposed, what the US has been pushing EU to do under the NATO framework, and the potential crisis in the Asia-Pacific region. Global Times: Initially, the Russia-Ukraine crisis was seen by public opinion as a conflict that would strengthen NATO unity. But as the conflict drags on, differences within NATO have been increasingly exposed. As several EU leaders have mentioned ""Ukraine fatigue,"" there are even voices suggesting that Kiev ""will have to make some territorial concessions to Moscow to end the current conflict."" Does this conflict reveal more of NATO's dilemmas?Clegg: I think that things are quite up in the air. We've seen some major changes and shifting attitudes toward militarization in EU, weakening or really eradicating some of the pillars for peace that were set in place from the end of World War II.For example, we've seen big shifts in Germany in agreeing to send arms to conflict areas. We've seen the ending of neutrality of Sweden and Finland who both want to join NATO now. And we can remember that Donald Trump was really disparaging about NATO and demanded the 2 percent of GDP military spending. But at that time, EU was quite reluctant to do this. So we've seen that barrier being broken down, and Germany committed earlier in the conflict to 100 billion euros in military spending. We've seen quite a shift in EU, and it remains to be seen how this is going to work out. The Europeans pushed through a raft of measures very rapidly, for example, more or less immediately ending plans for Nord Stream 2. At the same time, we saw a lot of diplomatic activities, particularly on the part of Macron, who was speaking to Vladimir Putin, but it's really Joe Biden and Boris Johnson that have pushed the situation to become a proxy war between NATO and Russia and risk all the time a direct confrontation drawing NATO in. They've been pushing countries to commit to the supply of weapons. But as you say in the last few weeks, we're seeing some divergence over what the ""endgame"" of this actually is with people like Joe Biden and Boris Johnson insisting on the defeat and weakening of Russia, the overthrow of Vladimir Putin, with Macron saying, no, we mustn't humiliate Russia.We've seen Italy putting forward a peace proposal, with a high degree of autonomy for the Donbas region. So I think that this question of the ""endgame"" is still very much a matter of debate within NATO, with Joe Biden and Boris Johnson pushing for more sanctions and arms, demanding no negotiations with the ""butcher of Russia,"" and some of the Europeans still looking for another outcome.Global Times: The consequences of the Russia-Ukraine conflict are likely to be increasingly serious and EU countries are bearing considerable losses, such as soaring energy prices and inflation. Do you think that the ""security threat posed by Russia,"" as promoted by NATO, is convincing to EU societies?Clegg: It does seem as if the sanctions are hurting EU more than expected. They committed to banning 90 percent of Russia oil imports by the end of the year. Also, the squeezing of gas supplies will hit Germany and Italy very hard. Russia's action - its previous takeover of Crimea, and before that, its action against Georgia - surely is unsettling for its neighbours. But to view NATO as a defensive organization can't be sustained when NATO has launched wars in the Middle East, and it has a policy of the first use of nuclear weapons.Basically, I think the problem for EU is that it has surrendered its strategic thinking to NATO and the US, and has really abnegated any serious foreign policy beyond economic relations. It's been happy to trade with the rest of the world, but not to do any of the hard strategic thinking. Macron has talked about the idea of strategic autonomy, but is EU autonomy really possible when it doesn't have a foundation in its defense industry?Another thing is that EU has forged the idea of its civilization or superiority on the issue of human rights. It's constantly in a dilemma over questions of commercial interest vs liberal ideals. EU has really been caught in this dilemma of it's old transatlanticism and the prospects of a long-term rebalancing toward Eurasia, and EU has been found wanting. It's not prepared to radically rethink its positioning and stay away from reliance on NATO for its defense and security.Global Times: The economy is the primary political issue in any country. How do you think, for example, in the UK, voters will influence the diplomacy of their leaders? If the economic situation continues to deteriorate, what impact will it have on the direction of the Russia-Ukraine conflict?Clegg: Indeed, you think that the economy would be the primary political issue, but don't forget when you're talking about the UK you're talking about a country that voted for Brexit. Politics is not necessarily rational, and it's becoming more and more clear that Brexit is a factor now in why UK is the worst performing G20 country apart from Russia.I'd also secondly query this notion of leaders. I think that we're led by a bunch of crooks and cheats and liars. Having said that, certainly here in the UK, we're facing a summer of discontent. We've had strikes during the week by rail workers, which will be followed by strikes of UK airways workers. And then this week we're also looking toward decisions of teachers, health workers, postal workers. Indeed, it seems that at the moment, public opinion is quite sympathetic. There was a report this week that suggested that nearly half of households in this country are cutting back on food purchases. Inflation was rising as we were coming out of the pandemic. But looking ahead, the overall situation could get even worse if Russia cuts energy supplies to EU. However, in terms of the discussion about the cost of living crisis and inflation in this country, there's not much linkage between the inflation and the war situation.Our so-called leaders, like Elizabeth Truss, have been trying to tell US that we need to ""tighten our belts,"" and this is the ""price of freedom."" It's very heartening that we have some good trade union leaders, but they're not political leaders and they have to be very careful in terms of what they say. As far as changing UK's foreign policy in any fundamental way, this is an extremely tough task. Anything to do with the diminishing of UK's global status is just impossible to talk about. We still have been in the grip of a colonial mindset. Now the Tory government has embraced the idea of ""Global UK"" now that we're free of EU. This is built on the bedrock of the special relationship with the US.As I say, changing our foreign policy in any fundamental way is a very tough task. If, however, the government goes to the country anytime soon with a request for increasing military spending, I think that will really sharpen the contradictions. We may have even further protests and a politicization of the cost of living crisis.Global Times: After the NATO Summit in 2021, the organization adopted NATO 2030, which explicitly identifies China as a ""systemic challenge"" to NATO. Since then, how has NATO acted on dealing with China? Does this statement prolong NATO's life?Clegg: The US has been pushing NATO toward its so-called free and open Indo-Pacific agenda, and it's been doing so step by step to persuade the EU NATO members to face up to, what they've determined is, the ""China challenge."" And we can see that they've done so with quite a certain amount of circumspection. For example, first of all, they've been pushing on a commitment to freedom of navigation which NATO committed to two or three years ago. We've seen NATO members, as a result, taking part in military exercises with the UK, France and Germany sending warships into the China Sea. They also pushed for a ban on Huawei, and EU has been somewhat resistant to this. But I think that they will continue to push their agenda by drawing countries into their proposals on hybrid war, as I've suggested. It remains to be seen how the summit shapes up in continuing to shift the perceptions of threat as seen from the EU members of NATO.Global Times: Many believe that NATO will replicate the Ukraine crisis in the Asia-Pacific region and drag China down and that the potential ""Asia Ukraine"" could be Japan, South Korea, or the Taiwan island. What do you think? Is it likely that the Ukraine crisis will be replicated in the Asia-Pacific? Clegg: We have a new Prime Minister in Japan who sent offerings to the Yasukuni Shrine. So we have an indication of the kind of persisting attitudes that are amongst the elites in Japan. Again, After all, despite the drama and fanfare when Donald Trump took a little step over into the border, absolutely nothing has happened, which is extremely frustrating for the North Koreans. Let alone now South Korea has a more hardline government. I think that most attention has been directed toward the question of Taiwan, and it's very clear here that the US is coy with the one-China policy so as to aggravate China. China has made clear that it seeks a peaceful reunification with the island, but it has identified three red lines.First of all, it will take action if Taiwan declares independence; it will take action if negotiations on peaceful reunification are blocked, there's no way forward; and it will take action if there's a major incident. What a major incident would consist of remains to be seen. Clearly, as there are more military activities with the US becoming more militarily involved in Taiwan, there are always the dangers of an accident. It seems that from recent reports that I've heard, that the expectations among some people in Taiwan island that the US would intervene militarily in the case of a conflict with China mainland have completely collapsed following the Ukraine crisis.In that respect, China can bide its time. But clearly, the US is determined to draw a straight line from Russia to China using the Ukraine crisis as a lever, and claiming to build a new alliance of democracies which will be prepared to take a stand on Taiwan island.They've tried to draw parallels between Ukraine and Taiwan, which are completely different situations, because Ukraine is an independent country, and Taiwan is a part of China. The US in talking about a rules-based world order is really looking for that rules-based order to declare that only democratic entities are legitimate. I think that's how they're trying to build the case around Taiwan.",OPINION,VIEWPOINT,NATO alliance shows cracks under a weakening US leadership.

292,Make US’ ‘long arm’ toward China feel the pain: Global Times editorial,Global Times,2022-06-30,"On Tuesday, US President Joe Biden's administration placed five China companies on a trade blacklist for ""allegedly supporting Russia's military and defense industrial base."" On the same day, 20 other entities which have connections with China were also added to the blacklist by the US for allegedly helping Iran or supporting military application. This is the first time the US has taken action against China entities over Russia-related businesses since the Russia-Ukraine conflict broke out in February. US media claimed that the move was to demonstrate US' resolve and strength to implement sanctions against Russia. Who does US think it is? The UN? Or the judge and the police of the world? The US does not and should not have the privilege of being superior, and China will never accept any country that claims to be superior. The US' unilateral sanctions and long-arm jurisdiction have neither the basis of international law nor the authorization of the UN. They are completely illegal. Where does the US gain the confidence to set up a moral plaque for illegal actions? Once taking off the confusing disguise, the hegemony can be immediately revealed. After all, quite a few US elites today still regard the world of the 21st century as a ""jungle,"" and view the US as the most ferocious beast, or the only hunter in the jungle.However, the world is no longer a ""jungle society."" The rapid development of political civilization, economic globalization and the multilateralism has all made it difficult for the US to maintain its hegemony. More and more countries don't buy such US tricks, and the US' ability has been gradually falling short of its ambition. As a result, it starts to talk more about ""rules"" - using the ""rules"" to demand and constrain others, while the US itself is wandering outside the ""rules."" US hegemony seems to have become ""smarter,"" but the sly nature has not changed. China and Russia maintain normal energy, economic and trade cooperation. On what grounds is the US blocking the cooperation and ""punishing"" China? The China people are opposed to this, and will take necessary measures to safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of companies of our country. We must let the ""long arm"" of the US that has constantly reached out to China feel the pain and teach it a lesson.On the day that US announced sanctions against China companies, the G7 summit ended with a joint statement. The statement, which mainly reflects US's attitude, interests and style, is full of domineering and arrogant rhetoric and unreasonable content, creating a record in G7 history. It mentioned China 14 times, called on ""China to press Russia... to immediately and unconditionally withdraw its troops from Ukraine"" and urged China to give up ""expansive maritime claims"" in the China Sea. It also voiced ""grave concerns"" on China's human rights situation. Obviously, the illegal sanctions against China companies are consistent with this statement. This has reminded US of the Eight-Nation Alliance over 100 years ago, but today's China is not the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911) that could be bullied by foreign powers. Take Russia-Ukraine conflict as an example. Its essence and root cause are the contradictions between the US and Russia. It's the result of the strategic imbalance caused by the US-led NATO's eastward expansion. However, US has arbitrarily concocted the so-called ""China responsibility theory."" It's complete hooligan logic. People have seen that the sanctions against Russia by the US and its followers have ""reached the political limit,"" but they have failed to generate the expected effect. Instead they have fallen into the traps they dug, with energy shortages and soaring prices. If they don't clean up the economic chaos themselves, what qualifications do they have to put the blame on China, which has been working hard to promote talks and peace?It's worth noting that US National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said not long ago that there was little evidence China was supporting Russia militarily or was violating in wholesale fashion sanctions imposed on Moscow. The US government's contradictory statement on this issue has not only reflected the chaotic decision-making of the current Joe Biden administration, but also once again demonstrated the US' bad habit of shifting the blame to others. US wants to create a false impression in public opinion that ""China can take actions to solve the crisis."" On one hand, it tries to shirk its ""special responsibility"" for the Ukraine crisis, and on the other, creates new common enemies to maintain ""unity"" within the US-led camp.The US sanctions on China companies on Tuesday set another extremely bad precedent. According to past examples, once the US sets a precedent, it will continue to expand its scope of attack according to its own needs. The sooner the international community stops the US, the less damage it will cause. Opposing hegemony is not only a matter of international morality, but also a must-do for safeguarding legitimate interests.",OPINION,EDITORIAL,Illustration: Liu Rui/Global Times,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'US': ('LOC', 20), 'China': ('LOC', 9), 'Russia': ('LOC', 5), 'Iran': ('LOC', 1), 'Ukraine': ('LOC', 1), 'Joe Biden': ('PER', 1), 'UN': ('ORG', 2)}"
293,‘Unity of NATO’ a disguise of its existential crisis,Global Times,2022-06-30,"Not surprisingly, Turkey on Tuesday lifted its veto of Finland and Sweden's bid to join NATO after the three countries signed an agreement. In his speech after arriving in Madrid for the NATO Summit, US President Joe Biden stressed the unity of the organization, saying NATO was ""as galvanized as I believe it's ever been.""The accession of these two neutral countries to NATO will increase the organization's membership to 32 countries. NATO was never meant to be a so-called regional security organization, but rather an aggressive military bloc and political instrument set up in EU to help maintain US global hegemony. Despite what the US would like, EU essentially believes that NATO should be a defensive group of its own security. In US hands, NATO is the spear; in EU eyes, it should serve as the shield. As NATO continues to expand, the gradually exposed differences in the interests of NATO members will result in more disputes and conflicts within the alliance. And the expansion raises the problem of a security dilemma, in which the uneasiness of NATO's neighbor countries increases, in turn leading the entire region and even the world into an arms race and seriously changing the geopolitical landscape. Mistrust and the risk of war are on the rise, making the region and the world less secure. Song Zhongping, a China military expert and TV commentator, told the Global Times that NATO is just an outdated Cold War organization that has long lost its so-called unity or cohesion. The U-turn in Turkey's attitude was due to a deal that was more satisfactory to all parties. Turkey wants to receive assurances that the Nordic countries were willing to address support for the Kurdish groups Turkey designates as terrorist organizations, in particular the Kurdistan Workers' Party. And the memorandum says Finland and Sweden ""extend their full support to Turkey against threats to its national security,"" making sure they will not provide support to those groups. The Nordic countries also affirmed there were no national arms embargoes relating to Turkey, and the three countries would work together on extradition requests. According to Song, this is a huge victory for Turkey, which has been demanding major power status since Turkey President Tayyip Erdogan came to power. And it can even be said that Turkey is the only winner in Finland and Sweden's accession to NATO. ""Turkey confirms that it has a voice in NATO, while the two Nordic countries are more insecure after joining the alliance,"" Song noted. Erdogan achieved his political goals with this move, and the fact that NATO is internally scattered has come to the fore. The divisions within NATO grow as more countries are dragged in. The US hopes to bridge the divisions within NATO, but it's difficult to cater to all needs. On the issue of the Russia-Ukraine conflict alone, there are different demands among West countries, as Germany, France and Italy want to stop the war as soon as possible, and the US is calling on all NATO countries to make a common cause against Russia. Wang Shuo, a professor at the School of International Relations of Beijing Foreign Studies University, believes that in this situation, many EU countries are questioning whether NATO can solve the crisis in Ukraine. If it cannot work, what's the point of NATO's existence? At the moment when Europeans believe that NATO needs to play a role, it proved itself disunited and incompetent, another sign of NATO's existential crisis. Russia will probably have to swallow the bitter fruit - NATO's further expansion. But the two Nordic countries' joining NATO is a provocation and humiliation to Russia, and new enmity will be deeply sowed. EU will not become safer with this significant expansion. Wang pointed out that joining NATO is like buying medical insurance for serious illnesses, which is a psychological comfort for many EU countries: the insurance may be useful, but everyone wants to avoid it coming in handy. Joining NATO is not a no-cost benefit; countries may be ""extorted"" by NATO, the ""insurance company,"" as the latter brings far more trouble than benefits.Whether it is the hype of the ""Russia threat"" or the emphasis of the agreement between Turkey and the two Nordic countries, it has nothing to do with the so-called ""unity"" of NATO, but only a life-saving straw to prolong NATO's life.",OPINION,OBSERVER,Cartoon: Vitaly Podvitski,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'Turkey': ('LOC', 10), 'Finland': ('LOC', 3), 'Sweden': ('LOC', 3), 'Madrid': ('LOC', 1), 'US': ('LOC', 4), 'China': ('LOC', 1), 'NATO': ('ORG', 12), 'EU': ('ORG', 3), 'Global Times': ('ORG', 1), ""Kurdistan Workers ' Party"": ('ORG', 1), 'NATO Summit': ('MISC', 1), 'Cold War': ('MISC', 1), 'Nordic': ('MISC', 3), 'Kurdish': ('MISC', 1), 'Joe Biden': ('PER', 1), 'Song Zhongping': ('PER', 3)}"
294,EU’s ‘moral support’ for Ukraine masks a country beset by problems,Ding Gang,2022-06-30,"Last week, EU Council President Charles Michel announced the decision to grant Ukraine and Moldova the status of EU candidate members. Ukraine signed its application for EU membership on February 28 and was approved by the EU as a candidate in 115 days, which is much less than the time spent by previous Central and EU countries.Obviously, the EU considers this issue as a form of ""moral support."" This moral is actually a clear message to Russia. To tell Ukraine that ""you are our EU brother."" and also to tell Russia that ""Ukraine is not your comrade.""The latter is more important - as a signal to Russia that the EU will not back down because of the Russia-Ukraine war.For the countries that want to join the EU, this signal is meaningful. For example, Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro, Kosovo, North Macedonia and Serbia in the West Balkans all have the EU membership aspirations, and they have traditional ties with Russia.However, EU public opinion generally agrees that Ukraine still has some way to go before it can truly become a member, as it must implement reforms in accordance with EU standards. The assessment conditions include whether the country has a stable democratic system, respect for human rights and a free market economy. This includes strengthening the rule of law and improving human rights. At the same time, its success depends on whether Russia and Ukraine can finally reach a peace agreement. The EU will not lower these standards just because it is Ukraine. The issues involved in these criteria are the same reasons why countries like Sweden, Denmark and the Netherlands have been opposed to admitting Ukraine.In fact, Ukraine is still in the process of rebuilding its country after the end of the Cold War, and the process of dealing with the Cold War legacy is bound to be fraught with geopolitical risks.The EU's ""moral support"" for Ukraine is an encouragement to the pro-EU factions, but what does it mean for pro-Russia factions? Even if the war ends, I am afraid that the split will not be healed in the near future.After the Cold War, Ukraine faced problems not only from the involvement of external forces that affected the reconstruction of its political structure, but also from the heavy Cold War legacy that constrained its own reforms.Ukraine's corruption has become a focal point of unrest. The government also lacks the capacity to deal with minority issues, especially the ability to build a national consensus.Since gaining independence, Ukrainians have constantly demonstrated a desire to integrate and become part of EU, while at the same time the squeeze on ethnic Russia within its borders has grown stronger. This has given way to the possibility of intervention by outside forces.A comparison with neighboring Poland shows where Ukraine's problems lie. Long before the EU decided to expand to the east, Poland set out to resolve the issues of borders and minorities, namely the territorial integrity of the nation-state and the protection of the cultural rights of minorities. Ukraine today does not have the capabilities for solving these problems that Poland had at that time.What is more, any kind of political choice for Ukraine today has to be made between EU integration and Russia integration due to the sharp confrontation between the two powerful neighbors.The Cold War is seemingly over, but the long shadow is still there.The next small- and medium-sized countries that are going to join the EU have similar problems, and it might be naive to think that integration into EU will lead to a great national harmony.Attention to these issues is necessary as Asia faces a more active involvement of EU countries, especially the US-led NATO members, in the pursuit of the Asia-Pacific security frame.The author is a senior editor with People's Daily, and currently a senior fellow with the Chongyang Institute for Financial Studies at Renmin University of China. dinggang@globaltimes.com.cn.

This visit will be of great significance as observers expect that Xi Jinping will point out in his speech the direction of the city's future development, especially after the implementation of the national security law for Hong Kong and electoral system reform helped restore stability in the city.  Observers in Hong Kong and the mainland believed that Xi Jinping's visit to Hong Kong amid an increasingly complex geopolitical environment sends a clear message to Hong Kong and to the world that the ""one country, two systems"" principle is beneficial to the country and to the city, and will be unswervingly upheld for the long term despite smears and doubts by the West. It also serves as an important warning to some external hostile forces as well as extremist secessionists in the city that the country will never tolerate those who sabotage Hong Kong's prosperity or the country's sovereignty, security and development interests.Carrie Lam, the outgoing chief executive of the HKSAR, and Luo Huining, director of the central government's liaison office in Hong Kong, welcomed Xi Jinping and the first lady Peng Liyuan on the station platform. They were surrounded by local residents and students waving China national flags, flowers and banners with the words ""Warmly welcome President Xi Jinping to attend the celebration of the 25th anniversary of the city's return to the motherland and the inaugural ceremony of the sixth-term government of the HKSAR.""Inside the station, a lion dance was held and the atmosphere of excitement was palpable. Xi Jinping extended congratulations and best wishes to Hong Kong compatriots as he gave a short speech inside the station. He said he has always been concerned about Hong Kong and his heart is always with Hong Kong compatriots. ""It has been five years since my last visit to Hong Kong,"" Xi Jinping said upon arrival at the West Kowloon high-speed rail station.Over the past five years, I have been all along concerned about and caring for Hong Kong, and my heart is always with Hong Kong compatriots, Xi Jinping said.'A brighter future will beckon'In the recent period, Hong Kong has withstood many severe tests and overcome many risks and challenges. After many storms and hardships, Hong Kong has been reborn and shown vigorous vitality, Xi Jinping said, noting that the reality proves that the ""one country, two systems"" principle has strong vitality that will ensure the long-term prosperity of the city and benefits of Hong Kong compatriots. ""A brighter future will beckon, if we forge ahead with perseverance,"" said Xi Jinping, noting that as long as the principle is upheld unswervingly, Hong Kong will surely have an even brighter future and make new, greater contributions to the great rejuvenation of the China nation. ""It's expected that with the care of Xi Jinping and the central government, the practice of 'one country, two systems' will be stable and sustainable in Hong Kong, and the city's status and importance in the country will be more prominent with its prosperity and stability much guaranteed,"" Lau Siu-kai, the vice-president of the China Association of Hong Kong and Macao Studies, told the Global Times on Thursday. Accompanied by Lam, Xi Jinping met with some 160 people from various sectors of Hong Kong and representatives of the disciplined services at the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre on Thursday afternoon. The President also visited the Hong Kong Science Park to inspect Hong Kong's innovation and technology development while his wife Peng Liyuan visited the Xiqu Centre of the West Kowloon Cultural District. Chan Yung, vice-chairman of the Democratic Alliance for the Betterment and Progress of Hong Kong, who was also among the 160 representatives, told the Global Times that Xi Jinping's visit greatly boosts the confidence of Hong Kong people, especially after the city has been battling the epidemic for two years. ""Also, we face a growingly complex geopolitical environment as the Ukraine crisis goes on and the pandemic has not ended,"" Chan said. China adjusted its quarantine policy for close contacts and international arrivals ahead of Xi Jinping's visit. Chan, who also served as a deputy director for Chief Executive-elect John Lee's campaign office, said he believed it's a positive signal for Hong Kong's economic recovery, as many are expecting the resumption of mainland-Hong Kong exchanges. Xi Jinping's choice to go to Hong Kong by high-speed rail demonstrates the development of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, which shows a major achievement of the practice of ""one country, two systems"" in the area, Li Xiaobing, an expert on Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan affairs at Nankai University, told the Global Times on Thursday.Being a key part of China's high-speed rail network, the entire line of the Guangzhou-Shenzhen-Hong Kong Express Rail Link entered into service on September 23, 2022. The line is 141 kilometers long, of which 115 km is on the mainland and 26 km is in the Hong Kong SAR.While Hong Kong is still in the aftermath of the fifth wave of its COVID-19 epidemic and Macao is witnessing sporadic cases, and the current international situation is bringing about more uncertain factors, Xi Jinping's visit to the SAR shows his and the central government's trust in and concerns about Hong Kong, Li noted.Significant political messageNo matter how hard the West media and politicians twisted the ""one country, two systems"" and slandered the national security law for Hong Kong and electoral reform by claiming that the city has completely changed and there's no freedom anymore, the city has been moving on, ignoring those trivial voices and embracing a brighter future as the central government also points out a clear direction for it. During a meeting with Lam, Xi Jinping said the central government acknowledged her work over the past five years, as she made significant contributions to leading the HKSAR government to govern according to the law, uniting all sectors in society to stop violence, fighting COVID-19 outbreaks and integrating Hong Kong into national development while safeguarding sovereignty, security, development interests and the city's stability as well as prosperity. The implementation of the national security law for Hong Kong and the electoral reform crushed plots of a ""color revolution"", bringing order back to the city and giving an opportunity for the city to select qualified leaders and competent patriots.  While the ups and downs of the past few years have led to doubts among some people about whether China will continue upholding the ""one country, two systems"" principle, Xi Jinping's visit set the fundamental tone on this issue, serving as a political vow, Tian Feilong, a legal expert at Beihang University in Beijing, told the Global Times on Thursday. ""Also, it sent out a clear warning to those extremists in Hong Kong and the external forces that attempt to interfere in Hong Kong affairs: any force sabotaging stability, prosperity, security and development interests would meet a resolute crackdown by the central government,"" he said.",CHINA,POLITICS,"Chinese President Xi Jinping and his wife Peng Liyuan wave to the welcoming crowd upon their arrival in Hong Kong, on June 30, 2022.

""China has always placed ties with the Philippines in a prioritized position of diplomacy to neighboring countries.""In recent years, under the joint efforts of both sides, the China-Philippine relations have continually improved, and brought concrete benefits to the people of both sides, and the visit of Vice President Wang as special representative for President Xi Jinping to the inauguration ceremony of President Marcos thoroughly shows that China values ties with the Philippines, Zhao said.""Hopefully, this visit will be helpful for both sides to inherit friendship, improve mutual trust, continue cooperation, and open a broader future of development for China-Philippine relations,"" Zhao said.Chen Xiangmiao, an assistant research fellow at the National Institute for China Sea Studies, told the Global Times on Tuesday that thanks to the foundation laid by Rodrigo Duterte,  ties have witnessed a series of progress.""China continues to be the biggest trading partner of the Philippines, and also increased direct investments to the Philippines, especially in infrastructure construction, including hospitals, bridges, roads and hydropower stations, and there are still great potentials for both sides to improve the existing cooperation,"" Chen noted. Apart from the infrastructure cooperation and trade, in fields like energy and food security, as well as agriculture, the two sides still have space to cooperate, especially under the impact of the latest turbulence in the international situation, such as the Russia-Ukraine crisis and West sanctions against Russia, Chen said. ""The Philippines is facing challenges in these aspects,"" he noted.Another significant legacy for ties left by the Duterte administration is the handling of the China Sea issue, and dialogue and coordination mechanisms have been established to manage the problem, said experts.  ""For instance, in 2017, both sides established the bilateral mechanism for negotiations and coordination on the China Sea issue, and this mechanism has helped with timely communication and handling over the divergences and cooperation in the sea, which effectively avoid uncertainties brought by the China Sea issue,"" Chen said. Apart from this, China and the Philippines also established the law-enforcement cooperation mechanism between the coast guards of the two countries. In January 2020, a China coast guard vessel also made its first visit to the Philippines, which is a significant breakthrough for bilateral ties on maritime issues, Chen said. The six years of the Duterte administration's term saved and fixed ties worsened by the Aquino administration, said China analysts, noting that the ties are likely to continue this positive trend, and even if there are some challenges and impact from external forces, the general direction of  China-Philippine relations won't be changed significantly. ""Duterte has changed the former president Benigno Aquino III's one-sided policy toward the US,"" Xu Liping, director of the Center for Southeast Asia Studies at the China Academy of Social Sciences in Beijing, told the Global Times on Tuesday.Duterte adhered to an independent and pragmatic foreign policy toward China, and enhanced the political mutual trust between the two countries, Xu noted.The US is a key factor that could bring a negative impact to China-Philippine ties. The US doesn't want to see China-Philippine ties develop along the positive track, but wants to use the Philippines as a pawn to serve its strategy to contain and compete with China in the region, to lower the cost for the US to conduct military surveillance in the region and to use the China Sea issue to hype conflicts and increase arm sales, Chen noted.  The key to future China-Philippine relations is to properly handle the differences between the two countries, especially the China Sea issue. Relations should not be meddled by external factors, but should focus on common issues for efficient dialogue and consultations, including the promotion of some key strategic initiatives between the two sides, Xu said.",CHINA,DIPLOMACY,"Ferdinand Marcos Jr. arrives at his campaign headquarters in Mandaluyong City, Manila, the Philippines, on Monday, May 9, 2022.Photo: VCG","Reporter, Beijing","Yang Sheng is a chief reporter at the Global Times covering Chinese politics, diplomacy and military.","{'Philippines': ('LOC', 7), 'Manila': ('LOC', 1), 'US': ('LOC', 1), 'Russia': ('LOC', 2), 'Ukraine': ('LOC', 1), 'West': ('LOC', 1), 'China Sea': ('LOC', 13), 'Xi Jinping': ('PER', 2), 'Wang Qishan': ('PER', 2), 'Ferdinand Romualdez Marcos': ('PER', 3), 'Jr': ('PER', 1), 'Zhao Lijian': ('PER', 3), 'Chen Xiangmiao': ('PER', 3), 'Rodrigo Duterte': ('PER', 1), 'Foreign Ministry': ('ORG', 2), 'National Institute for China Sea Studies': ('ORG', 1), 'Global Times': ('ORG', 1), 'Philippine': ('MISC', 3)}"
299,Asia-Pacific countries should not stand under ‘dangerous wall' of NATO: Global Times editorial,Global Times,2022-06-28,"The NATO summit kicked off on June 28 in Madrid, Spain. In the eyes of onlookers, the bloc - the product of the old Cold War - is lifting the curtain on a ""new cold war."" An article in Foreign Policy, published on Monday, articulated that ""another, very different sort of cold war is beginning… as we will see at the NATO summit in Madrid - where the leaders of Japan, South Korea, Australia, and New Zealand will join the gathering for the first time - new battle lines are being drawn that could last for generations."" This somewhat pessimistic judgment reflects the international community's general concern about the current situation.Relevant reports, almost without exception, all said that China will be listed a ""challenge"" for the first time in NATO's so-called new Strategic Concept. US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said NATO's strategy paper would ""speak in ways that are unprecedented about the challenge that China poses."" But in terms of how to describe China, intense discussions are underway among NATO members.It is said that, unlike the US and UK's radical attitude toward China, countries such as France and Germany believe that more measured and cautious terms should be used to describe China. France President Emmanuel Macron previously warned that ""we shouldn't bias our relationship with China."" Some diplomats from Lithuania and Portugal also expressed concerns about focusing too much on China, as NATO countries do not share a single border with China. This ""fierce discussion"" itself is enough to show how absurd the rhetoric of ""China threatens NATO"" is. NATO has 30 member states, and their demands on interests and external attitudes cannot be the same, but US's strategic will is increasingly coercing and is kidnapping NATO. This makes countries that seek security guarantees by joining NATO often become vassals or pawns of US. In the end, their security environment will not fundamentally improve. They will face unpredictable worsening risks. In any case, NATO cannot change the nature of being a military and political bloc. Its very existence poses a threat to world peace and stability.Mencius, an ancient China philosopher, once said that a gentleman does not stand under a dangerous wall. To some extent, it can be said that NATO is the biggest ""dangerous wall"" in the world today.NATO directly caused and continuously strengthened EU's security dilemma and the outbreak of the Russia-Ukraine conflict is a manifestation of its disastrous consequences. Facts have proven that the extreme pursuit of absolute security under the name of collective defense will eventually lead to confrontation between camps. In other words, NATO is by no means an antidote to EU's security crisis, but poison. If anyone spreads such poison to East Asia, which is called ""the oasis of world peace and development,"" the behavior is insidious and appalling. Whatever the reason, Japan, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand, especially Japan and South Korea, should not be present at the NATO summit. This is a very negative move. What can participation in this transatlantic military and political gathering with a strong Cold War characteristic and strong hostility toward China bring to these Asia-Pacific countries? What will they lose? It's not difficult to figure out. The countries that are moving toward NATO, either actively or passively, may gain a few compliments from US, and make somewhat connections with the military bloc. However, the interests of Asia-Pacific countries are based on the peace and stability of the region. Catering to NATO's Asia-Pacificization is tantamount to inviting wolves into the house. It's an extremely unwise choice for any Asia-Pacific country and is bound to damage that country's strategic trust with China, inevitably leading to consequences. The sewage of the Cold War cannot be allowed to flow into the Pacific Ocean - this should be the general consensus in the Asia-Pacific region. If countries closely interact with NATO while intentionally or intentionally bringing Cold War into the Asia-Pacific, they will be no different to those people who insist on not driving drunk despite the fact they do. EU's security is at a complicated impasse and all parties are still trying to find a solution. Asia-Pacific countries must learn lessons from EU from a right angle. In general, all tendencies shown at this NATO summit are wrong and dangerous. For Asia-Pacific countries, keeping vigilance against and opposing the Asia-Pacificization of NATO is a due task to keep their eyes open and tell right from wrong.

300,NATO summit to show unity amid deeper cracks,Zhang Hui,2022-06-29,"The Joe Biden administration this week ramped up efforts to mobilize its EU allies in crafting long-term plans on prolonging the Russia-Ukraine conflict and dealing with China for the coming decade with the start of the NATO Summit in Madrid, to ensure EU will follow the US' playbook and show the world the West is more unified than ever, China analysts said. But will EU completely follow the strategic plan the US has imposed on them? Will this West unity prevail and will it stand the test of time? China analysts believe that under the seemingly unprecedented unity was unbridgeable divide among NATO's 30 members on major issues including how to define China, how to respond to the Russia-Ukraine conflict and the possible spillover of it, as well as how to deal with Turkey. They said that as the leader and coordinator of NATO, the US will try to consider the interests of different members, but the US-led alliance will sacrifice some members, noting that the Baltic region could be left vulnerable. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg reiterated at a pre-summit press conference on Monday that the NATO Summit will be transformative, including a new Strategic Concept for a new security reality which will address China for the first time, including challenges that China ""poses to our security, interests, and values."" In response, Zhao Lijian, China Foreign Ministry spokesperson, said at Tuesday's media briefing that the concept is nothing more than ""old wine in a new bottle,"" and has not changed the Cold War mentality of creating ""imaginary enemies"" and engaging in confrontation. The detailed Strategic Concept has yet to be revealed, but has divided the alliance into at least two different groups, with the US and UK trying to push for more forceful language in describing China, but France and Germany favor more ""measured references,"" Reuters reported. One diplomat said a compromise was taking shape under which China would be described as a ""systemic challenge,"" while including balancing language referring to a ""willingness to work on areas of common interest"" with Beijing, Reuters said. Belgian Prime Minister Alexander De Croo warned that ""the last thing we should do is turn our backs to China the way we are turning our backs to Russia"" on Monday, citing China is an important trading partner, the China Morning Post reported on Tuesday.Lü Xiang, a research fellow at the China Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times on Tuesday that NATO will politically show hostility toward China under US pressure, but will not have any real actions, especially militarily, targeting China. Dealing with Russia alone has fueled a cost of living crisis in many NATO countries with residents taking to the streets in protest. How can the alliance tackle China, the world's second largest economy? analysts said. They believe the leaders of France and Germany, the backbone of the EU, will remain rational. Twenty-one members of NATO's 30 members are also EU members, and in 2021, China was the third largest partner for EU exports of goods and the largest partner for EU imports. Analysts said the US is trying to kidnap EU for its China and Russia policy, but countries like France and Germany have been advocating EU's strategic autonomy and hold views different from the US on the global economic and security order. NATO allies planned to discuss longer-term support to Ukraine, apart from offering fuel and anti-drone systems, to help modernize the Ukraine armed forces, according to NATO. Analysts said that the US wanted its EU allies to prolong the Russia-Ukraine conflict to weaken Russia, but EU countries try to help end the Ukraine crisis through negotiations. Two days before Joe Biden arrived in EU, a Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll showed that his approval rating fell to 36 percent, the lowest since late May. Only 18 percent of US think the country is headed in the right direction, the poll said. Lü said Joe Biden's EU trip will not help in his midterm election. Donald Trump may run again in 2024, and if Donald Trump wins, the best result for NATO would be the US becoming indifferent to NATO, and NATO would likely see the US withdraw or even try to disband the alliance. Russia-Ukraine conflict Analysts believe Russia has been moving ahead in its military operation against Ukraine, which makes NATO uneasy, and the possible spillover of the conflict is a far bigger challenge for NATO. The US and its allies have been transporting weapons to Ukraine through Poland, and more provocative moves may eventually irritate Russia so that the Russia-Ukraine conflict could spill over to Poland, Lü said, noting he believes NATO has no mature plan on whether to protect Poland. It seems that NATO's plan to protect the Baltic region, which is another possible spillover region for the conflict, is not ready yet. Bolstering the defense of the Baltic region is deemed as one of the most important decisions for NATO leaders to discuss during the summit, CNBC reported on Monday. Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania have repeatedly called on NATO for an urgent update to its so-called ""tripwire"" approach, the report said. Financial Times quoted Stoltenberg as saying that ""we never share the details of operational plans,"" but said NATO has been able to protect countries bordering Russia for decades.To better protect its eastern flank, NATO plans to increase its rapid reaction troops from 40,000 to 300,000, the report said. But NATO attaches more importance to the interests of its 12 founding members, so it's possible that NATO may sacrifice the three Baltic countries to protect the founding members in West EU, Song Zhongping, a China military expert and TV commentator, told the Global Times. If countries like Lithuania provoke Russia leading to Russia launching military operations, NATO would not send  military forces to help the three Baltic countries, but more likely through offering military assistance like what they did to Ukraine, Song said. It's not known whether any progress in Sweden and Finland's admission into NATO will be made during the summit, but Turkey has said it is willing to delay Swedish and Finnish membership of NATO for more than a year. Liu Zuokui, a research fellow on EU studies at the China Academy of Social Sciences, believes that Turkey has dug a hole in the supposedly united West camp by voicing its dissatisfaction. Turkey's open opposition may damage the trust between Turkey and other NATO members, deepen the internal conflicts among the members and affect NATO's decision-making system, Liu said.",CHINA,DIPLOMACY,"NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg (right) and Spain's Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez deliver joint statements on the opening day of the NATO summit in Madrid, on June 28, 2022.

The NATO eastward expansion has not only failed to make EU secure, but sowed seeds of conflict. It is a lesson worthy of reflection, according to the UN brief on the meeting on Tuesday.While NATO leaders recently painted other countries as a threat, he stressed the organization itself is actually the cause of trouble. NATO must abandon its Cold War mentality based on bloc confrontation, he said, expressing concern over the organization's strategic adjustments.""We urge NATO to learn its lessons, not provoking camp confrontation with the excuse of Ukraine crisis, nor provoking a new Cold War, nor seeking out imaginary enemies in the Asia-Pacific region to create conflicts and divisions,"" Zhang said.China firmly opposes NATO's involvement in the Asia-Pacific region or the creation of an ""Asia-Pacific version of NATO.""

303,"Exclusive: US plants Trojan horse programs in hundreds of important Chinese information systems; new cyber weapon targets China, Russia",Zhao Siwei,2022-06-29,"On Wednesday, China's National Computer Virus Emergency Response Center and a leading cybersecurity company disclosed a new vulnerability attack weapon platform deployed by the US National Security Agency (NSA), which experts believe is the main equipment of the NSA's computer network hacking operation team, and it targets the world with a focus on China and Russia. The US' move raised wide suspicions that the country might be preparing for a bigger cyberwar, experts noted. Recently, a number of China research institutions have found traces of activity of the validator Trojan. A report the Global Times obtained from Internet Security Company 360 on Wednesday shows ""validator"" is a small embedded Trojan that can be deployed remotely or manually on any Windows operating system. It has a 24/7 online operation capability, allowing NSA system operators and data thieves to upload and download files, remotely run programs, obtain system information, forge IDs and self-destruct in emergency situations. The weapon allows the NSA to collect information about the environment of a targeted system, while also enabling the installation of more sophisticated trojans, the report shows. Earlier, the company discovered that the NSA had used a series of cyber weapons to launch continuous attacks against government agencies, important organizations and information infrastructure targets in countries around the world, including China. During the attack, the NSA would implant backdoor programs represented by ""validator,"" which could be hidden in the internet terminals of target users for a long time, and then launch more complex network attacks through these backdoor programs.The Trojan is believed to be the default version of the NSA's ""Acid Fox"" weapon. This indicates that the China research institutes mentioned above were subjected to cyberattacks by the NSA's Acid Fox vulnerability attack weapon platform. According to the report, the Acid Fox platform is an important infrastructure for the Tailored Access Operations (TAO), the cyber warfare intelligence agency under the NSA, to carry out cyber espionage operations against other countries. Notably, the server numbered XS11 was explicitly assigned to GCHQ, the UK intelligence agency, to conduct man-in-the-middle cyberattacks. In addition, TAO has dedicated servers for targets in China and Russia.An expert from China's National Computer Virus Emergency Response Center told the Global Times, on condition of anonymity, that the ""Acid Fox"" platform will detect the software and hardware environments of target hosts before exploiting their vulnerability. Details disclosed in the report shows that the weapon explicitly targets computer anti-virus software in China and Russia for ""technical confrontation."" In addition, the US has deployed cyber espionage servers targeting China and Russia on the internet to implant malicious programs and steal intelligence, the expert said. In order to maintain its cyber hegemony, the US has been monitoring the world. As recently as June 1, NSA Director and Cyber Command head Gen Nakasone confirmed that the US had launched a series of offensive cyber operations against Russia in support of Ukraine amid the conflict between Russia and Ukraine.While conducting espionage against global targets, the US also spares no effort to perform ""a thief shout to catch a thief,"" calling on its so-called allies to trumpet the ""China threat"" theory, slander China's network security policy and international economic and cultural exchanges plans, the expert said, then continued slamming the US for cracking down on China companies and news media operating legally abroad, for inciting discord, and for encouraging so-called hackers to launch cyberattacks on foreign targets.Based on the successful extraction of the ""validator"" Trojan horse program samples from the important information system of a domestic scientific research institution, 360 company carried out scanning and detection and found that different versions of the Trojan horse program had been running in hundreds of important information systems in China, and its implantation time was much earlier than the time when ""Acid Fox"" platform and its components were publicly exposed, indicating that the NSA carried out internet attacks on at least hundreds of important information systems in China. Multiple ""validator"" trojans are still running in some information systems, relaying information to NSA headquarters. According to 360 company's report, the discovery of ""validator"" samples in local network servers or internet access terminals indicates that these devices have been attacked by the NSA and important information in the system has been stolen by the agency.A large number of ""validator"" trojans are running in critical information infrastructure in other countries, which is far more than in China, the company said. According to a report published by the National Computer Virus Emergency Response Center, the NSA has used these weapons to cooperate with other ""Five Eyes"" countries' intelligence agencies to set up a global network information gathering system. The system deploys a global scale covert intelligence-gathering servers and springboard servers, which has maintained the largest scale of spy network in human history. It is still expanding and is becoming a common threat to all mankind.The expert from the center said despite the overwhelming evidence, the US will continue to conduct cyber espionage and cyber warfare in the future.On June 22, the US Congress passed a $761 billion defense spending bill for fiscal year 2023, which includes the $11.2 billion cyber space activities budget for the US Department of Defense, an increase of 8 percent compared with the previous fiscal year. The country also increased its cyber warfare forces from 137 to 142.The US has also introduced a series of consecutive bill, increased the scale of network security budget, strengthened their own critical information infrastructure security defense level, held all kinds of domestic and international cyber warfare exercises, and limited the export of sensitive network security technology.""Based on US' move, we cannot help raising the suspicion that the country is actively preparing for a larger cyberwar,"" the expert said.",CHINA,SOCIETY,hacker Photo: VCG,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'China': ('LOC', 7), 'Russia': ('LOC', 2), 'US': ('LOC', 1), 'UK': ('LOC', 1), 'National Computer Virus Emergency Response Center': ('ORG', 3), 'US National Security Agency': ('ORG', 1), 'NSA': ('ORG', 9), 'Global Times': ('ORG', 2), 'Internet Security Company 360': ('ORG', 1), 'Tai': ('ORG', 1), 'TAO': ('ORG', 2), 'XS': ('ORG', 1), 'GCHQ': ('ORG', 1), 'National Computer': ('ORG', 1), 'A': ('ORG', 1), 'Fox': ('ORG', 1), 'Trojan': ('MISC', 3), 'Windows': ('MISC', 1), 'Acid Fox': ('MISC', 3)}"

As of the end of February, there were 653 coal mines in the provinces, of which nine are large mines with capacity above 10 million tons a year.Impacted by the prolonged pandemic and the Russia-Ukraine conflict, the prices of fossil fuels including coal, oil and natural gas surged to record highs, which, along with soaring shipping freight and a strong US dollar, which have constrained China's coal imports this year.According to latest data released by the General Administration of Customs of China, China imported 95.96 million tons of coal in the first five months of 2022, down 13.6 percent on a yearly basis.Global Times",SOURCE,ECONOMY,"View of piles of coal on a quay in Rizhao, East China's Shandong Province Photo: cnsphoto",Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'North China': ('LOC', 4), 'Shanxi Province': ('LOC', 4), 'Russia': ('LOC', 1), 'Ukraine': ('LOC', 1), 'US': ('LOC', 1), 'Xinhua News Agency': ('ORG', 1), 'National Bureau of Statistics': ('ORG', 1), 'General Administration of Customs of China': ('ORG', 1), 'Global Times': ('ORG', 1)}"

306,"NATO expansionist agenda a threat to global security, a US tool to control EU and enhance hegemonic manipulation capacity",Ding Gang,2022-06-29,"Editor's Note:Amid the still ongoing Russia-Ukraine military conflict, NATO, which has been adding fuel to the conflict, started a three-day summit in Madrid, Spain, from June 28 to 30. The NATO alliance works to increase pressure on Russia over its conflict with Ukraine while underscoring their continued concerns about China. For the first time in history, leaders from four Asia-Pacific countries - namely Australia, Japan, South Korea, and New Zealand - were also invited to attend the NATO summit. The militant group which has already made troubles for EU is now trying to create its own Asia-Pacific chapter to interfere in Asia. How did the organization come about? How was it born from the Cold War mentality and gradually became a poisoner of world peace? Why is this military alliance extending its ""dark hand"" to Asia? The Global Times will publish a series of four articles on how NATO is expanding. This is the second installment.In April 1999, when NATO celebrated its 50th anniversary, it completed its first round of eastward expansion after the Cold War. The Global Times reporter was then stationed in Brussels, where NATO's headquarters are based, and witnessed the flag-raising ceremony to mark Poland, the Czech Republic, and Hungary joining NATO. Back then, some media outlets said NATO had formally set in motion the return of Central and EU. At that time, NATO had also pressed the button for the massive bombing of Yugoslavia. The bombing, code-named ""Operation Allied Forces,"" which began on March 24, 1999, lasted 78 days, killing more than 2,500 innocent civilians and displacing more than 1 million.This was the first time that NATO deployed forces without the approval of the UN and it targeted a sovereign country that had posed no threat to NATO members. This military action shows that NATO's development logic had begun to shift from a strategy of military defense to ensure collective security to one that looks beyond its traditional EU defense zone under the so-called banner of a ""humanitarian intervention mission.""NATO ""resurrected"" itself with the so-called humanitarian banner and the US once again found a handle that could bring the West world together under an ideological banner. However, NATO's expansion did not address the question of the non-West world's concerns, that is, who determined what a humanitarian crisis was, and what the basis of international law for interventions was that transcended sovereignty. If the US and NATO have the final say, it means that as long as they believe and decide it is a humanitarian crisis, they can wage a war to solve it. The logic behind NATO's expansion was never one for upholding peace.

Since its establishment in 1949, NATO has always been a military tool for maintaining and promoting US' and EU's Cold War strategy. It is also a political group with an inherent motivation to consolidate and advance ideology.In its early days, NATO's main task was that of military defense while preventing the resurgence of Germany militarism. From the 1950s to the 1980s, the confrontation and escalating deterrence of EU's two major military blocs, NATO and the Warsaw Pact, became a great threat to global peace. The reason why the Cold War did not turn into a ""hot war"" was because of the continuous escalation of deterrence actions on both sides, forming a ""balance of terror,"" although there was a thrilling moment in the form of the Cuban missile crisis. The confrontation between the two major blocs in EU has become the best realistic embodiment of the well-known ""balance of power"" theory.NATO is also a political bloc that serves ideology. After the end of World War II, both the US and the Soviet Union had a great sense of fear of each other. They also believed that the type of civilization promoted by the other side was bound to decline.Former US president Richard Nixon once defined US strategy during the Cold War as deterrence, competition, and negotiation. Among them, competition was the most important one. Both deterrence and negotiation were aimed at maintaining the balance of military power and the sphere of influence while expanding strategic influence. All these efforts were made to win the ideological competition. The confrontation between the two blocs showed the violent clash of different ideologies, meaning the pace of the expansion of West civilization in the world has never stopped. This expansion was a major reason for war in many regions during the Cold War era. As a military tool, NATO has always been at the beck and call of the US global strategy, and its role changes in accordance with the adjustment of this strategy. As long as the US does not change its ambition to maintain its global hegemony, NATO will definitely exist. As Marwan Bishara, a senior political analyst at international news channel Al Jazeera, pointed out, ""NATO has decidedly been the military arm of a privileged club of West capitalist democracies.""

Graphic: Tang Tengfei/GTA military tool to expand West civilizationWhen examining the logic of NATO's expansion, the merger of East Germany and West Germany in October 1990 should be the first to be analyzed as it was the real watershed moment in EU geopolitics. At that time, then West Germany chancellor Helmut Kohl believed the EU integration process would never stop at the Elbe River, one of the major rivers in Central EU. The merged Germany maintained its membership in NATO, further enhancing the power of the bloc, bolstering the ideological identity of the West, Central, and EU countries, and strengthening their sense of security. In 1999, Poland, the Czech Republic, and Hungary joined NATO. Behind the eastward expansion of NATO, the strategic dominance of the US can be clearly seen. The US uses expansion as a handle to control NATO and enhance its hegemonic manipulation over EU and the rest of the world. On December 8, 1998, then US secretary of state Madeleine Albright expounded that the ""North Atlantic Treaty involves commitments to collective defense, it also allows US to come together to meet common threats that might originate from beyond the North Atlantic area.""After joining NATO, Poland demanded the presence of US troops. About 3,000 US troops have been stationed in Poland on a rotational basis to train the Poland army ever since. The US also bases NATO's missile defense system along the Baltic Sea coast. However, none of these actions had alleviated its fear of Russia. In 2018, the Poland Ministry of Defense even offered the US financial support in the range of $1.5 billion to $2 billion for the deployment of a permanent US armored division in Poland, according to a ministry proposal, US-based Defense News reported in May 2018.The geopolitics of EU has undergone significant changes since the eastward expansion of NATO. These changes are obviously closely related to the strategy promoted by the US in EU since the beginning of the Cold War, and the rejuvenation of ""old EU"" also caters to and reinforces the consistency of this strategy, at whose core is also ideological consistency.The most remarkable aspect of this ideological consistency is the nature of the expansion of West civilization, which, from the very beginning, took world conquest as its mission. Therefore, as a military tool, NATO's defense can maintain its strong expansion capacity.NATO has a strong appeal to Central and EU countries mainly because it can provide the sovereign defense capability for countries that have only recently split from the former Soviet bloc. Besides, NATO itself has an ideological appeal.NATO also strengthened its ideological draw to new EU members, requiring new NATO members to solve problems in institutional construction, border demarcation, and ethnic conflicts. This is the main reason why some NATO members have been reluctant to admit that the current Ukraine crisis resulted from rash decisions. 'If I can't swallow you, I'll crush you.'Some NATO experts argued at the time that the ideal outcome of NATO's expansion would be to integrate a ""reformed"" Russia into the EU system, making EU a ""paradise of permanent peace."" But the ever-changing reality of EU soon showed that was simply an illusion.Former US president George Bush proposed, in 1989, the ""Beyond Containment"" strategy to promote the integration of the Soviet Union into the existing international system. However, Bush's successor, Bill Clinton, turned the strategic goals to ""strengthen US global leadership"" and prevent the emergence of a dominant power in EU or Asia that poses a strategic threat to the US.""If I can't swallow you, I'll crush you."" This is the strategic logic of the US toward any country that might potentially challenge its hegemony. Strategically, NATO wants to integrate Russia into the bloc and make Russia submit to US dominance of the global political and economic system, or NATO wants to break Russia down so that it can no longer fight back.There is a very stubborn logic in the expansion of NATO, that is, the order of West civilization represented by the US should be the order of EU and even the world. Other countries must follow this logic, or they may become potential enemies of the US and the West.The end of the Cold War reinforced US's belief that the basic principles of ""liberal democracy"" that NATO has boasted to defend and protect can be introduced to the world as common norms by which all nations must live. This understanding divides the world simply into ""democratic"" and ""undemocratic"" factions. This stubborn logic by the US did not die with the Cold War. On the contrary, the US has only shown its eagerness in triggering regime changes in other countries and regions. This perception also brought up theories such as ""the end of history."" Such logic also allows NATO, which calls itself a ""defensive organization,"" to wage wars, in violation of international law, against sovereign states NATO was involved in the Bosnian and Yugoslav wars in 1992 and carried out an aerial bombing campaign against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in 1999. NATO also joined the war in Afghanistan and the 2003 Iraq war, as well as intervening in the domestic conflicts of Libya and in recent military conflicts between Russia and Ukraine. All these military actions have brought lasting tragedy to the countries concerned and a tragic humanitarian legacy to the world.The goal of NATO's expansion has gradually projected beyond EU and directly to the Asia-Pacific region and the entire world. Today, in the 2020s, we still have to ask one major question: How, if at all possible, can countries with different civilizations, ideologies, political systems, and historical and cultural traditions live together in peace?",IN-DEPTH,IN-DEPTH,"Demonstrators take part in an anti-NATO protest ahead of the NATO summit in Madrid, Spain, June 26, 2022.

307,The Economist deletes racist tweet amid torrents of criticism,Global Times,2022-06-29," UK publication The Economist on Wednesday deleted a tweet which compared pigs with China people after it encountered a tidal wave of criticism for being racist and dehumanizing.The now-deleted tweet was published on Tuesday and was used by The Economist to promote an article titled ""Most of the world's grain is not eaten by humans.""""In 2019 pigs ate 432m tonnes of grain, 45% more than the people of China did,"" it read. The sentence is a direct excerpt from the article, which, published on June 23, claims that despites the food crisis amid the Russia-Ukraine conflict, the world in fact is able to produce enough grain to meet humanity's needs. The problem is that 43 percent of the grain ""is either burned as biofuel or used to feed animals,"" which is equal to six times the grain output of Ukraine and Russia combined.Considering that fact, reducing waste and turning wheat and maize into bread instead of animal feed is probably the best remedy while governments are mulling policies to get a greater share of grains into grub, the article concluded.Although the article mainly focuses on analyzing data of food consumption per country, area, and year, the inappropriate comparison between pigs and China was widely criticized for being ""awful,"" ""racist"" and ""dehumanizing.""""Humans don't write like that,"" veteran China journalist Liu Xin commented on Twitter.Some pointed out that the comparison had allegedly violated Twitter's rules on speech, and ""For Twitter to allow The Economist to make such incendiary statement is beyond the pale.""Some China netizens showed their disappointment toward the magazine after the issue emerged on China social media platforms.

On the heel of the G7 summit, NATO leaders are scheduled to convene in Spain from Tuesday to Thursday for their annual summit with the main focus on Russia and toughening up its stance toward China, while analysts said including China in the US-led military bloc's new strategic concept cannot help alleviate US divergences with the EU, especially on China, and severe domestic problems will also weaken US's ambitious plan to maintain hegemony. The NATO summit, to be held in Madrid, will for the first time include the top leaders of four Asia-Pacific countries, Japan, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand, and also for the first time, the bloc will identity China in its new strategic concept, a key document on NATO's future security trial and military development to be adopted at the summit. NATO and some of the US allies have ramped up efforts to hype the so-called China threat. For example, the White House released the readout on US President Joe Biden's meeting with Germany Chancellor Olaf Scholz on Sunday ahead of the G7 summit, in which it noted that the two leaders discussed the challenges posed by China. An anonymous White House official was also cited by Reuters as saying that the US is confident that NATO's new strategy document will include ""strong"" language on China. NATO will massively boost the number of troops on high readiness to over 300,000, Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said on Monday.The current NATO Strategic Concept which was agreed at the summit in Lisbon in 2010 did not mention China. Analysts said that it is not surprising to see the upcoming new strategic concept include China since during last year's summit in Brussels, the bloc had adopted a tough rhetoric on China's military build-up, growing influence and ""coercive economic"" measures. NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg also told an event organized by Politico in Brussels on June 22 that it is a big step for NATO to include China in its current Strategic Concept as ""China is openly contesting the rules-based international order"" and poses some challenges to ""our values, our interests, and our security."" At the G7 and NATO summits, the US is going to serve as the baton to mobilize the West to take China as an adversary - mostly by combining China and Russia. This is a new version of the cold war and by coercing other countries to reduce their exchanges with China on economy and other fields, the US attempts to exclude China from the global community, Xiang Haoyu, a research fellow at the China Institute of International Studies, told the Global Times. For example, on Sunday at their annual gathering, G7 nations pledged to raise $600 billion in private and public funds over five years to finance infrastructure in developing countries and counter China's Belt and Road initiative.The inclusion of China in the ""Strategic Concept"" means that China will become a priority of NATO in the next few years, which will also affect the direction of its foreign policy and strategy, Yuan Zheng, a deputy director and senior fellow of the Institute of US Studies, the China Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times on Monday.NATO, a legacy of the Cold War, is increasingly extending its reach beyond EU, to the Asia-Pacific region particularly, where it hopes to play a more prominent role, suppressing the development and influence of Russia and China, Yuan added.The focus of NATO's global strategy and geopolitics seems to be in the Russia-Ukraine conflict, but it is really in the Indo-Pacific region around China. The US sees China as a main competitor and is using all means to contain it. Other West countries also want to take good positions in the area given the region's significance in the global supply chain and future developments, Xiang said. Hyping so-called China threats will offer NATO and the US more excuses and ""legitimacy"" to be involved in the Indo-Pacific region, Xiang said, pointing out that some countries in the region, especially Japan, have been working to help serve as the pivot for NATO to enter Asia. On Saturday, before his five-day trip to EU, Japan Prime Minister Fumio Kishida was quoted by Japan media as saying that Japan hopes to boost cooperation with NATO ""to a new stage."" Analysts warned that Japan's advocacy of an ""Asia NATO"" or ""global NATO"" goes against the times and could lead to a new cold war or even a hot war given the previous catastrophes and destruction the US-led military alliance has made globally, including in Afghanistan.  In the context of the current Russia-Ukraine crisis, the US and the West have demonstrated an unprecedented unanimous tough stance, Yuan said, noting that the US has been hyping the theory of ""the axis of authoritarianism"" between China and Russia, which directly leads to rising anxiety in EU countries about China, and China-EU relations have encountered relatively great difficulties.


Divergences on ChinaWhile the US is working hard to impose its strategic purposes to its allies, attempting to tie China and Russia together, comparing Ukraine with the island of Taiwan, and to mix the security of Asia and EU together to seek profits, there are divergences between the US and some West countries, which may make it hard for the US to realize its ambitious plan, Cui Hongjian, director of the Department of EU Studies at the China Institute of International Studies, told the Global Times on Monday.Major powers in EU want to put the Russia-Ukraine conflict under control and bring the two sides to the negotiating table, while the US and Japan want to use the crisis to prolong the geopolitical conflict into a long-term confrontation, Cui said, noting that some countries in EU insist that China will not challenge the international order with military forces given its development paths in the past decades.Cui said that China and the EU have different stances on many issues but the two sides hope to work in the same direction and to stabilize relations not only in trade but also bilateral relations. The US hype of the China threat and pressure on the EU is a test for the leading countries in EU on whether they can maintain strategic autonomy.In last year's summit in Brussels, France President Emmanuel Macron was quoted by media as saying that NATO is an organization that concerns the North Atlantic, and that China has little to do with the North Atlantic. It's very important that we don't scatter ourselves and that we don't bias our relationship with China."" The US has been committed to expanding its alliance system around the world, but it is difficult to establish a new NATO in Asia. The culture, history, values and other factors of Asia-Pacific countries make China's influence in this region hard to ignore, Yuan said.Yuan also noted that China pursues an independent foreign policy of peace and win-win cooperation, and with the deepening of China-EU exchanges, EU countries' perception toward China will also improve. US political elites' plans to maintain its hegemony by using the Ukraine crisis have also worried some of its allies and such an ambitious global project will also be weakened by its domestic problems. Gun violence, racism, the wider and increasing rage toward the US' Supreme Court decision to overturn abortion ruling… all these have reminded the world that the US is far behind its Golden Age, analysts said. The EU also faces serious problems on energy, social welfare, soaring inflation, and human rights problems. Some observers have warned it may lose the best change to solve domestic problems and will only harm the world if still follows the US in making a speculative strategic arrangement.",CHINA,DIPLOMACY,NATO swallows the consequence of its expansion Illustration: Carlos Latuff,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'NATO Summit': ('MISC', 1), 'G7': ('MISC', 2), 'NATO Strategic Concept': ('MISC', 1), 'G': ('MISC', 1), 'Madrid': ('LOC', 2), 'Spain': ('LOC', 2), 'Russia': ('LOC', 1), 'China': ('LOC', 13), 'US': ('LOC', 7), 'Asia': ('LOC', 1), 'Pacific': ('LOC', 1), 'Japan': ('LOC', 1), 'South Korea': ('LOC', 1), 'Australia': ('LOC', 1), 'New Zealand': ('LOC', 1), 'White House': ('LOC', 2), 'Germany': ('LOC', 1), 'Lisbon': ('LOC', 1), 'Brussels': ('LOC', 2), 'St': ('LOC', 1), 'West': ('LOC', 1), 'VC': ('ORG', 1), 'NATO': ('ORG', 9), 'EU': ('ORG', 1), 'Reuters': ('ORG', 1), 'Joe Biden': ('PER', 1), 'Olaf Scholz': ('PER', 1), 'Jens Stoltenberg': ('PER', 1)}"

Photo: AFPJapan will fundamentally bolster its defense in five years with a substantial increase in military spending, Japan Prime Minister Fumio Kishida announced Sunday during the Group of Seven summit in Germany, following the country's high-profile drills with the US and Australia and prior to participation in the US-led large-scale Rim of the Pacific Exercise (RIMPAC).Making the announcement at the multilateral occasion ahead of Kishida's attendance at the NATO summit on Tuesday demonstrated Japan's ambition of gaining international support for its military expansion, China observers said, noting Japan's attempt risks breaking the power balance in Asia-Pacific plus Japan's domestic militarism resurgence, which poses great threat to regional stability. Kishida highlighted the severity of the security situation surrounding Japan during the G-7 summit in southern Germany, citing Beijing's dispatch of ships to waters around the Diaoyu Islands and its gas field explorations in the China Sea as attempts to change the status quo by force, according to Kyodo News. Kishida did not specify the amount of the increase. There have been strong calls inside Japan asking the government to increase the budget equal to at least 2 percent of gross domestic product, the spending target for NATO nations, according to media reports.Japan, with its pacifist constitution, has long capped its defense budget at around 1 percent of GDP in recent years.The high-profile announcement at G7 is clear proof of Japan's ambitions, as it wanted to justify its military expansion to the international community with an excuse of so-called China threat, observers said.Zhou Yongsheng, deputy director of the Japan Studies Center at China Foreign Affairs University, told the Global Times on Monday it is highly likely Japan will interfere in the Taiwan question, considering Kishida's repeated comparisons between Ukraine crisis and Taiwan question.Of the possible spiked military spending, a large proportion will be dedicated to unmanned equipment, cyber and electromagnetic capabilities as well as intelligence-related functions, according to Zhou. ""Most of the money will be spent on expanding and enhancing capabilities of the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force,"" the expert said. With China in mind, the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force conducted the Nobel Partner 22 drill, a trilateral exercise with the US Navy and Royal Australia Navy in the Pacific Ocean from June COVID-19-24. The JS Izumo light carrier, the USS Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier and the HMAS Canberra amphibious assault ship participated in the drill, Kyodo News reported on Saturday. Aimed at deterring China, the US-led RIMPAC exercise will begin on Wednesday with the participation of 26 countries including Japan, Yomiuri Shimbun reported on Monday.Analysts said these drills are not only aimed at deterring and containing China, but also to conspire in a possible military intervention in the Taiwan question at the tactical level.The US has been indulging in Japan's military development and expansion in the Asia-Pacific, because that conforms to the US' strategic goal to contain China while costing the US less, Zhou said. Japan  is eager to boost its military strength and pull the US and the NATO closer to the Asia-Pacific. Kishida, before flying to EU, said on Saturday Japan hopes to boost cooperation with NATO ""to a new stage,"" Mainichi reported.Kishida met with Germany Chancellor Olaf Scholz on Sunday at the G7 where the two leaders said security in EU and the Asia-Pacific region are inseparable. Kishida and Scholz agreed to strengthen security cooperation through the next ""two-plus-two"" meeting of defense and foreign ministers and other inter-governmental consultations, NHK reported.Kishida then met France President Emmanuel Macron and expressed his desire for France to continue and strengthen its engagement in the Asia-Pacific region, according to NHK.In apparent responses to Japan's recent military activities, the China People's Liberation Army (PLA) held large-scale drills of its own that saw a large number of warships and warplanes operating in the Pacific Ocean, according to Japan's Defense Ministry and the island of Taiwan's defense authority.According to the defense authority on the island of Taiwan, six PLA H-6 bombers accompanied by electronic warfare and electronic intelligence aircraft flew through the Bashi Channel and entered the Pacific Ocean on June 21. On Thursday, two H-6J bombers of the PLA Navy and a H-6K bomber of the PLA Air Force flew through the Miyako Strait into the Pacific Ocean, and a Y-9 intelligence reconnaissance aircraft followed on Friday, according to press releases published by Japan's Ministry of Defense Joint Staff.The PLA sent a Type 052C destroyer and a Type 056A corvette in waters between the island of Taiwan and Japan's Yonaguni Island into the Pacific Ocean, and a Type 052D destroyer and two Type 054A frigates through the Miyako Strait into the Pacific Ocean on June 21, with another Type 052D followed the next day, Japan's Ministry of Defense Joint Staff said at the time, with later reports saying the ships started to return on Thursday and Friday.A four-ship flotilla consisting of a Type 055 large destroyer, a Type 052D destroyer, a Type 903A comprehensive supply ship and a Type 815 electronic reconnaissance ship have been circumnavigating Japan  from its West starting June 12, with all four ships having arrived  south of Japan's main island by Sunday, according to Japan's Ministry of Defense Joint Staff. The PLA drills serve as a deterrent to ""Taiwan independence"" secessionist and foreign military interfering forces, showing that the PLA has the will, confidence and capability to safeguard China's sovereignty, security and territorial integrity from any force, military experts told the Global Times.",CHINA,DIPLOMACY,Japan's Prime Minister Fumio Kishida,"Reporter, Beijing",Defense reporter at the Global Times covering weapons and military development.,"{'Japan': ('LOC', 13), 'Changi Naval Base': ('LOC', 1), 'Singapore': ('LOC', 1), 'Germany': ('LOC', 2), 'US': ('LOC', 2), 'Australia': ('LOC', 1), 'China': ('LOC', 4), 'Asia': ('LOC', 1), 'Pacific': ('LOC', 1), 'Beijing': ('LOC', 1), 'Diaoyu Islands': ('LOC', 1), 'China Sea': ('LOC', 5), 'Taiwan': ('LOC', 1), 'Ukraine': ('LOC', 1), 'Taiwanber': ('LOC', 1), 'JS Izumo': ('ORG', 1), 'AFPJapan': ('ORG', 1), 'NATO': ('ORG', 2), 'Kyodo News': ('ORG', 1), 'Studies Center': ('ORG', 1), 'Foreign Affairs University': ('ORG', 1), 'Times': ('ORG', 1), 'Zhou': ('ORG', 1), 'Self': ('ORG', 1), 'Defense Force': ('ORG', 2), 'Maritime Self': ('ORG', 2), 'Fumio Kishida': ('PER', 5), 'Zhou Yongsheng': ('PER', 1), 'Group of Seven': ('MISC', 1), 'Rim of the Pacific Exercise': ('MISC', 1), 'RIMPAC': ('MISC', 1), 'G - 7': ('MISC', 1), 'G7': ('MISC', 1), 'Nobel': ('MISC', 1)}"
310,The US should take a serious look at the Global Security Initiative: Chinese diplomat,Xie Wenting and Bai Yunyi,2022-06-27,"Diplomats, experts and journalists participate in a teleconference on the BRICS on Monday in Beijing. Photo: Xie Wenting/Global Times""I hope the US can take a serious look at the Global Security Initiative (GSI) that China proposed as it is an important player in world security and the GSI ushers in new elements to uphold global peace,"" said Li Kexin, Director-General of the Department of International Economic Affairs of China's Foreign Ministry, during a teleconference on the BRICS cohosted by the China Public Diplomacy Association on Monday afternoon. The event attracted diplomats, experts and journalists from many countries.""I hope that that US can take a look at this initiative very seriously because they do have a very strong state for the world security. We'd like to see that China, with other major countries including the US, can work together to push, develop and materialize important GSI together,"" Li said.China's State Councilor and Foreign Minister, Wang Yi, told media on Friday after a series of BRICS meetings that, for some time now, the Cold War mentality and bloc politics have been on the rise. Traditional and non-traditional security threats have emerged one after another and some countries are seeking to expand their military alliances in pursuit of absolute security, coerce others to take sides and create confrontation, and disregard other countries' rights and national interests. International instability, uncertainty and insecurity are on the rise and the world faces a real risk of division and confrontation.Li noted that security is a major cooperation area of the BRICS. At this year's meetings, the Ukraine crisis, hot issues in the Middle East, counter-terrorism and other security issues were discussed.As Li pointed out, the GSI is underpinned by ""six commitments,"" namely, staying committed to the vision of common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security; staying committed to respecting the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all countries; staying committed to abiding by the purposes and principles of the UN Charter; staying committed to taking the legitimate security concerns of all countries seriously; staying committed to peacefully resolving differences and disputes between countries through dialogue and consultation; and staying committed to maintaining security in both traditional and non-traditional domains.Li remarked that important principles like non-interference in international affairs, rejecting Cold War mentality and upholding the principle of indivisible security, among many others in the GSI, reflect a comprehensive thinking about the new development and collective ideas to address security issues in the world.When asked about the issue of inflation that is troubling numerous countries, Li said the BRICS countries discussed this important issue in addition to measures including macro-policy coordination to address it.The XIV BRICS Summit Beijing Declaration made a ""call upon the international community to foster partnerships while underlining that it is imperative to strengthen macro-policy coordination in driving the world economy out of the crisis and shaping a strong, sustainable, balanced and inclusive post-pandemic economic recovery. We urge major developed countries to adopt responsible economic policies, while managing policy spillovers, to avoid severe impacts on developing countries.""According to Li, inflation is a systematic issue and there is no single reason for it, citing the quantitative easing one or two years ago as one reason.At the same time, the Ukraine crisis triggered unilateral sanctions which made commodity prices soar this year, Li said adding that ""this also gave a huge push to the inflation.""A report by Reuters on June 17 said that Euro zone inflation rose to a record high 8.1 percent last month in line with a preliminary estimate, more than four times the EU Central Bank's target. It pointed out that inflation has now become ""increasingly broad, affecting everything from food and services to everyday goods.""At the end of May, the EU decided to ban 90 percent of all oil imports from Russia by the end of the year, part of a wider array of sanctions which further escalates already exorbitant energy prices.Li noted that another element is the high tariffs imposed by some countries which also give strong push to inflation.He said that it is important for some countries to change their current policies, geopolitically and economically, to address the systematic issue of inflation.According to Li, the discussions related to the expansion of the BRICS also made positive progress. Argentina's Ambassador to China, Sabino Vaca Narvaja, previously told the Global Times that ""the BRICS cooperation mechanism is of great significance for the building of a new, more multipolar and balanced world.""""We are interested in joining the BRICS because it is a cooperation mechanism composed entirely of emerging economies. There are no strings attached and all cooperation is mutually beneficial,"" Vaca said.",CHINA,DIPLOMACY,Picture description not found,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'BRICS': ('MISC', 4), 'Global Security Initiative': ('MISC', 1), 'GSI': ('MISC', 4), 'Cold War': ('MISC', 1), 'Charter': ('MISC', 1), 'Beijing': ('LOC', 1), 'US': ('LOC', 3), 'China': ('LOC', 4), 'Ukraine': ('LOC', 1), 'Middle East': ('LOC', 1), 'Xie Wenting': ('PER', 1), 'Li Kexin': ('PER', 5), 'Wang Yi': ('PER', 1), 'Global Times': ('ORG', 1), 'Department of International Economic Affairs': ('ORG', 1), 'Foreign Ministry': ('ORG', 1), 'China Public Diplomacy Association': ('ORG', 1), 'UN': ('ORG', 1)}"
311,"S.Korea warned over fraying China ties, losing ‘diplomatic independence’ in bloc’s Asia push before NATO summit",Wang Qi,2022-06-28," South Korea President Yoon Suk-yeol is expected to meet with US President Joe Biden and Japan Prime Minister Fumio Kishida at the NATO leaders' summit from Wednesday to Thursday in Madrid, which would become Yoon's in-person debut on a multilateral stage. One day before Yoon's departure Monday, North Korea accused the US, South Korea and Japan of building a NATO-like military alliance in Asia, Reuters reported, citing a statement from North Korea's foreign ministry.  China experts said the US aim to further promote NATO's Asia-Pacific expansion through talks with Asia allies will create tensions on the Korean Peninsula, while Seoul's relations with Beijing will be more complicated if the Yoon administration gradually loses its diplomatic independence by relying on the US.An official at Seoul's presidential office confirmed on Sunday Yoon's meeting with the Japan and US leaders, marking the first three-way summit since 2017, on the sidelines of the 72nd session of the UN,  Reuters reported. South Korea's Yonhap News Agency said the lull was due to ""badly frayed relations between Seoul and Tokyo.""Some media claimed that the US wants to take the rare occasion with Tokyo and Seoul on the same table to improve ties between its two allies which have territorial disputes and wartime labor issues between them. However, Yonhap reported Saturday that Tokyo said it is unlikely to see the one-on-one leader summit or a pull aside meeting between Japan and South Korea leaders during the NATO summit.Media reported that Yoon aims to seek more international support for his administration's approach in dealing with the North Korea nuclear issue, which would also likely be one of the topics in a separate trilateral summit. Although the South Korea presidential office has previously explained that Yoon's Madrid trip should not be interpreted as a shift to an anti-Russia or anti-China policy, some analysts said the Seoul's new government is losing its strategic independence in boosting its alliance with the US, from exchanges at the US-led QUAD security dialogue, to participation in the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework and the upcoming NATO summit. And it's unrealistic to expect a zero response from Beijing. The summit between US, Japan and South Korea leaders is a step to promote the Asia-Pacific expansion of NATO, a Beijing-based expert told the Global Times on condition of anonymity. He explained that US alliances in the Asia-Pacific are mainly bilateral, and it wants to integrate them and promote smaller multilateral mechanisms, so it starts with Japan and South Korea.Besides security, media reported that Yoon will also hold talks with leaders from nine NATO nations, discussing topics like a secure chip supply chain, exporting nuclear reactors and weapons, South Korea presidential office said.The new South Korea government is trying to demonstrate its loyalty and support to US at a time when the Joe Biden administration needs to show off unity within its clique, the expert said. Lü Chao, an expert on the Korean Peninsula issue at the Liaoning Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times on Monday that although Seoul is restrained compared with Tokyo, which actively participates in anti-China activities, cooperating with Japan and the US in NATO's Asia expansion will have a negative impact on   peace and stability, especially northeast Asia and the Korean Peninsula, and even cause divisions and confrontations in the Asia-Pacific region.North Korea's Foreign Ministry on Sunday accused the US of ""making a full-fledged move to establish an Asia-style NATO"" by holding joint military exercises with Japan and South Korea, Reuters reported, citing the statement from North Korea's foreign ministry.The US wishes to have Japan and South Korea in the front for deeper interference in other issues in Asia with NATO at its back, said Lü.""After taking office, Yoon adopted a policy of almost unconditional deference to the US. The new South Korea government wants to enhance its status by interacting with US on the international stage. But it will damage South Korea's long-term national interests,"" the Beijing-based expert said. ""If the US asks South Korea to deploy more THAAD on its territory, South Korea will face strong backlash from China, Russia and North Korea, but it's also difficult for South Korea to turn it down. If the US demand that South Korea sacrifice its disputed territory to Japan in exchange for better cooperation within the clique, the South Koreans would also be in a dilemma,"" the expert noted. The US way to maintain its hegemony at a time of serious domestic problems is by bringing in allies to share the risks and costs. But if they cooperate with the US and NATO interference in the Asia-Pacific that harms China's interests, China will respond firmly, Lü said. China hopes South Korea can carefully assess the situation and give priority to the cooperative relations with China and other countries, experts said, noting that US policymakers may be thinking of creating a bigger crisis in the international community than the Russia-Ukraine conflict to ease its inflation, gun violence, racial issues and low approval ratings at home.",CHINA,DIPLOMACY,Yoon Suk-yeol Photo: Xinhua,"Reporter, Beijing","Global Times reporter covering international affairs, cross-Straits relations and Chinese society; a captive of his experiences.","{'South Korea': ('LOC', 6), 'US': ('LOC', 10), 'Japan': ('LOC', 5), 'Madrid': ('LOC', 2), 'North Korea': ('LOC', 3), 'Asia': ('LOC', 5), 'China': ('LOC', 2), 'Pacific': ('LOC', 4), 'Korean Peninsula': ('LOC', 1), 'Seoul': ('LOC', 5), 'Beijing': ('LOC', 3), 'Tokyo': ('LOC', 3), 'Russia': ('LOC', 1), 'Yoon Suk': ('PER', 7), 'yeol': ('PER', 1), 'Joe Biden': ('PER', 1), 'Fumio Kishida': ('PER', 1), 'NATO': ('ORG', 6), 'Reuters': ('ORG', 2), 'UN': ('ORG', 1), 'Yonhap News Agency': ('ORG', 2), 'Framework': ('ORG', 1), 'Indo': ('MISC', 1)}"

313,NATO’s expansion stumbles as members calculate costs,Yury Tavrovsky,2022-06-28,"Editor's Note:NATO, which is constantly looking for imaginary enemies and justifying its existence by inciting confrontation, is holding a summit from Tuesday to Thursday, and it also plans to extend its tentacles to the Asia-Pacific region. Behind its aggressive narrative, contradictions and divisions within NATO have become increasingly prominent. The Russia-Ukraine conflict is not going according to NATO's playbook. This series of articles will provide some clues regarding NATO's predicament. This is the fifth piece.NATO, the NATO, was established in 1949, but to this day it remains an important tool for suppressing the opponents of the West. The initiative to unite 12 countries originally belonged to the US, which became the most powerful world leader after the end of World War II. The US was the foundation of the organization's military power, a source of economic and financial assistance to member countries. It goes without saying that not only the highest command posts belonged to the US, but they also defined strategic objectives at all stages of NATO's activities. The main mission of this organization from the very beginning was the unification of military and economic resources under the command of the US to prepare an all-out war against the Soviet Union. The countries of another military bloc, the Warsaw Pact Organization (ATS), led by the USSR, also became enemies. It was created only six years after NATO - in 1955.NATO played an important role in weakening the USSR and its allies. After the collapse of the Soviet Union and the dissolution of the Warsaw Pact in 1991, the question arose about the feasibility of continuing the existence of NATO. But the US, which really ruled the bloc, set a new task for it - to involve former ATS member countries and post-Soviet republics in its structure. This was considered necessary to expand the zone of US's strict control over EU as the most important part of the world at that time. NATO was also used to ""sweep"" the EU space during the war against Yugoslavia. NATO and its de facto twin in the field of economics and politics - the EU - were used in organizing the ""color revolution"" in Kiev and provoking the current Ukraine crisis. In these situations, the US uses NATO as a tool for dirty work, saving the US from the loss of ""precious US lives"" and the risk of retaliatory strikes on the territory of the US.NATO's successful fulfillment of its tasks in EU led US to think about using the potential and experience of the bloc in another part of the world. Having recently identified China as the most serious threat to the international order, US is faced with a lack of resources to contain and suppress the growing China power. In order to mobilize the existing resources, the Joe Biden administration has developed a concept of Indo-Pacific security, strongly resembling a similar concept for the North Atlantic. The concept has already been reinforced by the creation of the Indo-Pacific Command of the US Armed Forces. Already available resources were activated - military alliances with Japan, South Korea and Australia. The AUKUS military group was created. The activity of the QUAD military-diplomatic group is stimulated. The creation of the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework was recently announced. But even these actions are not enough for US. Therefore, it is urgently necessary to extend the scope of NATO's responsibility to the Indo-Pacific region as well. Obviously, US efforts are aimed at uniting all Asia and EU allies, their military, economic and geostrategic resources to create a new tool for the realization of US global ambitions. It can be conditionally called the Indo-Pacific Treaty Organization according to the patterns of NATO.Of course, the arrival of NATO to the East, especially since the new military bloc of the West, will threaten the security interests of Russia as a Pacific power. But first of all, it will be directed against China. Strengthening the militarization of the region will also contradict the interests of economic stability and security of ASEAN, APEC and other groupings of the region. Serious obstacles may arise in the way of implementing Joe Biden's chess game. We are not talking about the fluctuations of EU satellites in NATO such as ""ready for anything"" Poland, the ""Baltic troika"" or the Balkan neoplasms. It is unlikely that we will talk about England with its age-old anti-China traditions and loyalty to US at the level of a conditioned reflex. But such large ""stakeholders"" as Germany, France, Spain and Italy may think hard about the consequences of entering into a military confrontation with China, taking into account their trade and economic interests. These powers are well aware of the benefits of bilateral trade with China, which amount to tens and hundreds of billions of euros. They are also aware of the intention of the White House to lift trade sanctions against China in an attempt to bring down the threatening increase in inflation. The role of trade and economic ""cannon fodder"" is unlikely to entice figures claiming some level of independence even within the framework of NATO. In Madrid, the leaders of significant EU powers are unlikely to voice their doubts, but then they will try to ""put on the brakes"" in implementation of Joe Biden's Indo-Pacific plan.Another important reason for avoiding the dubious honor of becoming a member of the anti-China coalition may be US's inconsistency. Just two years ago, then US president Donald Trump reproached NATO member countries for the insufficiency of military efforts, the desire to ""ride for free"" and even promised to dissolve the military bloc. What will happen after the next presidential election? Will Donald Trump come back? Won't those business and political circles that oppose the dispersion of the waning power of their power, for the concentration of resources on solving domestic economic and humanitarian problems, win?Europeans are already suffering losses from following Joe Biden's anti-China course. The ratification of the China-EU Comprehensive Investment Agreement has been disrupted. Taking into account the hostile policy of Poland and the Baltic countries, China logistics companies are reviewing the routes of goods delivery to EU via the Silk Road. Beijing is studying the experience of ""crippling sanctions"" against Russia. After all, US has threatened to impose similar sanctions not only in case of the aggravation of the situation around the Taiwan island, but even if China refuses to participate in sanctions against Russia.The US' convulsive attempts to return itself to the role of world hegemon are unlikely to succeed. But they can cause considerable harm to mutually beneficial relations between countries, which will be difficult to compensate quickly.The author is head of the ""Russia Dream-China Dream"" analytic center of the Izborsk Club. opinion@globaltimes.com.cn",OPINION,VIEWPOINT,Illustration: Carlos Latuff,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'NATO': ('ORG', 14), 'Warsaw Pact Organization': ('ORG', 1), 'ATS': ('ORG', 2), 'Warsaw Pact': ('ORG', 1), 'EU': ('ORG', 4), 'Asia': ('LOC', 1), 'Pacific': ('LOC', 1), 'Russia': ('LOC', 1), 'Ukraine': ('LOC', 2), 'West': ('LOC', 1), 'US': ('LOC', 11), 'Soviet Union': ('LOC', 2), 'USSR': ('LOC', 2), 'Yugoslavia': ('LOC', 1), 'Kiev': ('LOC', 1), 'World War II': ('MISC', 1), 'post': ('MISC', 1), 'Soviet': ('MISC', 1)}"
314,Internal development of China lays foundation for global efforts: Swedish scholar,Global Times,2022-06-28,"Editor's Note: For the China people, the past decade was epic and inspirational. The country, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China with Xi Jinping at its core, has made great endeavors in boosting its economy, deepening reforms, improving the rights of its people and acting as a responsible power globally.The Belt and Road Initiative which was put forward by President Xi Jinping in 2013, with 149 countries and 32 international organizations participating in it to date, has injected growing impetus and stability into global cooperation in a world of uncertainties. Stephen Brawer (Brawer), Chairman of the Belt and Road Institute in Sweden, in an interview with Global Times (Global Times) reporter Yu Jincui shared his views on how the initiative has boosted development of countries along the route, and also debunked West attempt of demonizing the Belt and Road with false narratives such as ""debt trap."" This is the 11th article of the series about this special decade.Global Times: How do you evaluate China's development over the past 10 years, and what changes have impressed you the most?Brawer: The internal developments of China are unique in human history. Over the last 10 years, in addition to launching the Belt and Road Initiative, which President Xi Jinping announced in 2013, there has been an incredible investment and development of infrastructure, which has raised China as an economic power worldwide, as well as the remarkable achievement of eradicating extreme poverty.This is also a completely unique type of world development in terms of economic progress. China has primarily achieved this through an incredible development perspective in both modernizing and achieving major infrastructure projects, primarily the development of high-speed railway, which has changed the entire internal ability of China to both provide and transport economic goods internally.But it is not limited to that. There has been a massive investment in eliminating pollution in terms of development of environmental factors, which has put China in a leading role in cooperating with West EU as a whole. Sweden has obviously been very interested in collaborating with China on the improvement of green technology and environmental issues.And beyond this, you have what President Xi Jinping has emphasized on, a commitment of the nation to innovation and technological improvement. And one can see that China has been in the forefront in terms of space development. There has been the first landing on the far side of the moon that was achieved by China. This has never been done by any other nation. You also have the development now of the China space station. In addition, China has been reaching out not simply to maintaining its own internal developments, but through the combination of BRICS. There is an increasing emphasis on how to promote a development perspective that has been lacking, unfortunately, in the West under what has also been called the unipolar world.So I think that the internal developments of China have laid the foundation for an incredible global effort, primarily through the Belt and Road, which can not only continue China's forward development, but also influence many of the other developing nations. Global Times: What role do you think has the CPC played in China's development?Brawer: I'm not an expert in internal China political organization. However, it's very clear that there is a historical commitment in China to what I would call the common good. That is the policy which China has pursued as the People's Republic and a centralized form of decision-making in the government that has been a key factor in being able to shape and direct policymaking.Global Times: In recent years, the West's narrative of the CPC has often avoided the positive role of the CPC in China's social progress and world economic development. Why can't the West face the CPC objectively?Brawer: There is a very big problem in West thinking, and it's extremely narrow-minded. There is not an ability to recognize in reality that China has become an enormous economic power in the world, and that in many ways it's directly related to China's political system. This narrowness in thinking in the West is preventing not only the West as a whole, but the populations of the West from recognizing and understanding the reality of what has occurred.This is, in my view, a deeper problem. The reason for that is there is a refusal on the part of the West to accept the fact that there is a rising new world order, which is referred to many times as multicultural or multipolar. Their lack of willingness to actually situate China in any kind of positive, legitimate and realistic role in the present world history is quite arrogant.Global Times: Your institute focuses on BRI studies. What do you think of the advancement and development of the BRI over the past nearly nine years? What changes has this initiative brought about? Brawer: This has been the leading initiative in modern history to bring about a new global development order, which is fundamentally based on the same ideas that have allowed for the internal improvements of China itself. It is emphasizing the necessity of modernization of infrastructure in order to overcome poverty in all areas of the developing world, and that initiative, although it is unfortunately generally looked at in a very negative way or even rejected by the Swedish government at this particular time, represents a unique initiative that is open to global cooperation. Now I see no other positive initiative of the type as the Belt and Road Initiative. At this time, there is nothing that has shown itself to be functioning in the scope and in the direction that the Belt and Road Initiative has actually done.The BRI is essential and unique at this particular point. I think that it's only to break through this kind of narrowness of thinking that is controlling the West that would open the door to collaboration and cooperation from the US, from EU, from the EU, which is in the interests of all nations.Global Times: Some West media and analysts attributed debt problems in countries like Sri Lanka to China and claimed the BRI is a tool of ""debt-trap diplomacy."" How do you respond to such narratives? Brawer: My colleague Hussein Askary, vice president of the Belt and Road Institute in Sweden, published an article on our website recently which specifically addresses the fraudulent nature of this attempt to characterize China as trying to manipulate and take over countries like Sri Lanka based on controlling the debt. I recommend people to read about it. My colleague wrote an excellent article showing that the majority of debt that Sri Lanka owes, about 90 percent, is to the West. Exactly as in the case of Pakistan, China's share of the external public debt of Sri Lanka is only 10 percent. West financial institutions hold the lion's share of the debt. It's those West international speculators who have caused the enormous debt problems in Sri Lanka, and it is not in any way a result of China's involvement in investing in Sri Lanka.So this debt trap narrative is a deliberately false narrative that has no substance. Noticeably, the debt trap narrative was not originally created by an economist, but some US ""researchers"" with background in security matters, who were commissioned by the US State Department to write a report ""Debtbook Diplomacy"" in 2018, and even stated that they would make Hambantota Port the ""template"" for this narrative. And that was launched precisely with the purpose of attempting to discredit or characterize in a completely false way what China's role has been and what the Belt and Road Initiative is really based on. So when you check the facts - the facts are presented quite nicely in my colleague's article, one sees that there is no truth to the so-called debt trap. It is just propaganda that is being circulated by the West. Global Times: The EU and the US in recent years have also come up with their global infrastructure plans, namely the Global Gateway and the Build Back Better World (B3W) initiatives. Both moves are viewed as attempts to rival the BRI. How will those plans affect the BRI? What do you think of the mindset of viewing the BRI in a zero-sum way? Brawer: These initiatives have no substance. They are basically being propagated in the name of countering what they see is the growing influence of the BRI. The BRI is actually built on the concept that nations accept voluntarily cooperation with China and want to be helped to develop their infrastructure. That has been shown to be a successful characterization of the developments in Ethiopia and the developments in Kenya with the building of rail systems. None of those things over decades have ever been even remotely considered by all of the so-called West financial institutions or the initiatives that have come from the West. These West initiatives, such as the Build Back Better World, have, in my view, nothing to offer in reality. They may attempt to throw some money with NGOs at the countries that they believe they have to prevent the BRI from taking form. But they are not based on true development perspective.To be very frank, most of the countries in the developing world are aware of this. That is why you have nearly 150 countries joining the BRI. I don't know of any countries at the moment who have joined Build Back Better World.Global Times: Has the EU fully tapped the potential of the BRI? In what ways can China and the EU deepen BRI cooperation?Brawer: Despite a West narrow-minded thinking and arrogance that is affecting the ability of cooperation, which otherwise could be expanded dramatically, there is increasing developments of trade that are going forward in light of the BRI. The BRI is not being stopped and it's going forward. But the question why the West is refusing to recognize that constitutes a serious problem. We have taken up the fact that the dramatic crisis that the world is facing right now in Ukraine could in fact have been and can be resolved if Ukraine would become the link or the bridge for economic development of China into EU. But there is a faction in the West that does not want peace, and they do not want that cooperation. So that's one of the characterizations of why the problem in Ukraine continues, and the people of Ukraine are suffering. The world is being put in a very, unfortunately, dangerous position, which could lead to an unnecessary global conflict. Therefore, if EU would embrace a much more open spirit of cooperation, which is what we advocate, as well as recognize the importance of trade in light of what the BRI offers, there will be no question that the difficulties that are even apparent in Sweden and in other EU countries could be resolved in a very positive way. Hopefully that will begin to change. But for the moment, as I've already outlined, the think tanks and the politicians who have accepted an enemy image of China and also Russia at this point, are at the moment controlling the mass media in the West and making it very difficult for people in the West to actually understand what the BRI is and how it could be beneficial. However, we are working actively and will continue to do so in order to give the real picture and to engage those businesses and others who recognize the benefits of cooperation rather than confrontation.",OPINION,VIEWPOINT,"A China-Europe freight train departs from Hefei, Anhui Province on June 24, 2022.

315,FM urges politicians refrain from making irresponsible remarks after Aussie PM warns China to learn from Putin's 'strategic failure',Xu Keyue,2022-06-28,"In response to a question over Australia Prime Minister Anthony Albanese' warning against China to learn from Russia President Vladimir Putin's ""strategic failure,"" a spokesperson of the China Foreign Ministry at a regular press briefing on Tuesday urged certain politicians to refrain from making irresponsible remarks, reiterating there is no comparison between Ukraine and the island of Taiwan given that the latter is not a sovereign state. Zhao Lijian said that China has stated its stance over the Ukraine crisis multiple times. Also, China has stressed multiple times that the island of Taiwan is not Ukraine and there is no comparison between the two.Zhao's comment came after Albanese made remarks on the Taiwan question in an interview with the Australia Financial Review (AFR) en route to the NATO (NATO) summit in Madrid, Spain.Albanese claimed in the interview that the Russia-Ukraine conflict has been a ""strategic failure"" that has made Russia a ""global pariah,"" something of which China should also take note.Chen Hong, president of the China Association of Australia Studies and director of the Australia Studies Center at China Normal University, told the Global Times on Tuesday that the latest remarks by Albanese are unsurprising as the new Australia prime minister is catering to the essential focus of the NATO summit - countering China.Albanese's anti-China remarks expose that the NATO summit is nominally focusing on the Ukraine crisis but essentially trying to coerce NATO members and four countries from the Asia-Pacific region - Australia, Japan, New Zealand and South Korea - to counter China, Chen pointed out.Amid the tensions between China and Australia in recent years, Chen warned the new Australia prime minister of the need to clearly understanding the significance and sensitivity of the Taiwan question and not blindly follow the US to challenge China's bottom line, which would draw fire against Australia itself.Since taking office in May, Albanese, who is a ""greenhorn on diplomacy,"" has largely taken a similar line to the US on China issue, which Chen said was dangerous as the  anti-China rhetoric would erode China-Australia relations.After Australia's new Prime Minister Anthony Albanese was sworn in last month, many had hoped that the new government could bring its ties with China back on track. Against this background, if pessimism persists among Aussie business communities, it should remind the Albanese government what they have done so far may be not enough to rebuild market confidence, and that more should be done to warm up Australia's economic relations with China.This year marks the 50th anniversary of the establishment of China-Australia diplomatic relations, which provides an opportunity to look back at all those good years and reassess the two countries' engagement and partnership.Under the former conservative Morrison government's strategy of antagonizing and confronting China, Australia's trade relations with its largest trade partner fell to their lowest level before Albanese took office.",CHINA,DIPLOMACY,Zhao Lijian Photo: VCG,"Reporter, Beijing","Global Times reporter following Australia and Japan issues, also with a focus on social issues and overseas studies.","{'Australia': ('LOC', 8), 'China': ('LOC', 14), 'Russia': ('LOC', 3), 'Ukraine': ('LOC', 5), 'Taiwan': ('LOC', 4), 'Madrid': ('LOC', 1), 'Spain': ('LOC', 1), 'Asia': ('LOC', 1), 'Pacific': ('LOC', 1), 'Japan': ('LOC', 1), 'New Zealand': ('LOC', 1), 'South Korea': ('LOC', 1), 'US': ('LOC', 2), 'Anthony Albanese': ('PER', 8), 'Vladimir Putin': ('PER', 1), 'Zhao Lijian': ('PER', 2), 'Chen Hong': ('PER', 4), 'Foreign Ministry': ('ORG', 1), 'Australia Financial Review': ('ORG', 1), 'AFR': ('ORG', 1), 'NATO': ('ORG', 5), 'China Association of Australia Studies': ('ORG', 1), 'Australia Studies Center': ('ORG', 1), 'China Normal University': ('ORG', 1), 'Global Times': ('ORG', 1), 'Alba': ('MISC', 1), 'Au': ('MISC', 1)}"
316,How NATO began with confrontation and ends with poisoning world peace?,Zhang Hao,2022-06-28,"Editor's Note:Amid the still ongoing Russia-Ukraine military conflict, NATO, which has been adding fuel to the conflict, started a three-day summit in Madrid, Spain, from June 28 to 30. The NATO alliance works to increase pressure on Russia over its conflict with Ukraine while underscoring their continued concerns about China. For the first time in history, leaders from four Asia-Pacific countries - namely Australia, Japan, South Korea, and New Zealand - were also invited to attend the NATO summit. The militant group which has already made troubles for EU is now trying to create its own Asia-Pacific chapter to interfere in Asia. How did the organization come about? How was it born from the Cold War mentality and gradually became a poisoner of world peace? Why is this military alliance extending its ""dark hand"" to Asia? The Global Times will publish a series of four articles on how NATO is expanding. This is the first installment. 

If the USSR - better known as the Soviet Union - were considered to be included in NATO, the organization of a military alliance ""would cease to be a closed military alignment of states and would be open to other EU countries which, together with the creation of an effective system of EU collective security, would be of cardinal importance for the promotion of universal peace."" This was what the Soviet Union said in the diplomatic note the country issued on March 31, 1954 to West powers stating its willingness to have considered joining NATO.Unsurprisingly, the Soviet Union was rejected.What's more, UK general Hastings Ismay, then NATO's secretary general, opposed in May 1954 the request made by the Soviet Union, saying that ""the Soviet request to join NATO is like an unrepentant burglar requesting to join the police force."" Ismay thus made it apparent that the NATO alliance was directed against the Soviet Union. In May 1955, over the objections of the Soviet Union, NATO brought into its fold West Germany, which the Soviet Union saw as a buffer zone. In response, soon afterward, the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact was formed, setting the stage for a confrontation between the world's two largest military blocs during the entire Cold War era.A military clique born of a confrontation mind-set NATO's origins lay mainly in the inherent hostility of West capitalist nations, with the US and the UK at its core, to the world communist movement, as well as in the so-called Red Scare - the West's fear of the Soviet Union's power during World War II.On March 5, 1946, in one of the most famous orations of the Cold War period, former UK prime minister Winston Churchill condemned the Soviet Union's policies in EU and declared, ""From Stettin in the Baltic to Trieste in the Adriatic, an iron curtain has descended across the continent."" Churchill's speech is considered one of the opening salvoes announcing the beginning of the Cold War.In the founding of NATO, if the Iron Curtain speech was a passing attack before a goal was scored, the final kick was the Truman Doctrine. On March 12, 1947, one year after the Iron Curtain address, then US president Harry Truman delivered a speech to a joint session of US Congress, in which he devided the world into two camps: ""liberal democracy"" and ""totalitarian communism."" In response to what he called the ""threat"" from the Soviet Union, he said actions must be taken to intervene and contain it, which came to be known as the Truman Doctrine.Starting from the Truman Doctrine, the US pursued the ""Marshall Plan"" in foreign economic policy and led the entrenchment of NATO in military and security policy. The Truman Doctrine was regarded as the ""starting point"" for the NATO mechanism and the Cold War trigger, by shifting from traditional policy from the Roosevelt era, which regarded the Soviet Union as an ally, to a policy aimed at containing the Soviet Union.On April 4, 1949, the US and 11 other countries jointly signed the North Atlantic Treaty in US, and NATO - NATO - was officially established. The principle of collective defense is at the very heart of NATO's founding treaty and is enshrined in Article 5 of the US Treaty. Collective defense means that an attack against one ally is considered an attack against all allies.Looking back on the founding of NATO, it is not hard to see that from the very beginning, the organization was formed in the Cold War era as a clique engaged in bloc confrontation and military threat. NATO, which was born out of this mind-set, built a grotesque Iron Curtain during the Cold War era.

About 2,700 military personnel from Georgia and other NATO members take part in the exercise. Photo: VCGTo confront the Soviet Union and control EuropeNATO's mode of conduct has a lot to do with the personalities of its military chiefs.Ismay, NATO's first secretary general, was remembered primarily for his role as former UK prime minister Winston Churchill's chief military assistant during World War II. In that capacity, Ismay served as the principal link between Churchill and the Chiefs of Staff Committee. Having brought down the ""Iron Curtain"" of the Cold War, Churchill recommended his right-hand man as the NATO secretary-general and put him at the forefront of the Cold War.As the first NATO secretary general, Ismay was ""assuming an entirely new role in the history of international organizations,"" and as such he helped to define the position itself. While in the post, Ismay was also credited as having been the first person to say that the purpose of NATO was ""to keep the Russia out, the US in, and the Germans down,"" a line that has since become shorthand meant to describe the alliance.The saying inherited and ""carried forward"" the UK's centuries-old policy of balancing of power - using NATO to fight the Soviet Union on the one hand, and using the US to hold down the continental challenger, Germany, on the other.Under Ismay's motivation, the US and the UK reached a consensus to use NATO to control the EU continent and to compete against the Soviet Union. Ismay once said that the NATO ""must grow until the whole free world gets under one umbrella.""Enlarging and setting firesAfter the establishment of NATO and in the face of increasing pressure from this organization, EU socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union signed the Warsaw Pact in 1955. Notably, the treaty was valid for only 20 years. In 1975, when the Warsaw Pact expired, the member states issued a statement reaffirming their willingness to not dissolve until NATO was disbanded. There is no doubt that such a statement is just a dream. NATO continued to exist, and the Warsaw Pact could not be dissolved. So the validity of the Warsaw Pact kept getting extended from 1975, until March 31, 1991, when the Warsaw Pact announced its dissolution after the disintegration of the Soviet Union.However, as a product of the Cold War, not only has NATO not withdrawn from the stage of history following the end of the Cold War, but instead it has continued to expand and grow. In order to justify its continued existence following the end of the Cold War, NATO updated its strategic concept many times over the decades since the demise of the Warsaw Pact, and the topics involved have also expanded from confronting military threats in the past to responding to terrorism and international and regional crises.In 1999, NATO absorbed Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic - three former Warsaw Pact members - as its official members, breaking the long-term stable geostrategic pattern after World War II, and casting a shadow over the multipolar trend that emerged after the Cold War. Since then, NATO has expanded eastward five times, and its member countries have increased from the original 12 in 1949 to the 16 in 1999 to the current 30. In the process of its expansion, NATO has also been ""moving forward"" toward Russia, reaching Russia's extremely sensitive ""homeland in history,"" - Ukraine - also known as the ""heel of the Russia Empire"" in Napoleon's eyes.Facing the looming squeeze, in December 2021, the Russia government was forced to draw its final ""red line"" in a draft security initiative submitted to NATO and the US. But since the disintegration of the Soviet Union, the security concerns of Russia, which lost its hegemonic status, have never been a concern in the eyes of the US and NATO. The West has not only brutally rejected Russia's draft security initiative, but also fanned the flames between Russia and Ukraine, leading to a military conflict between the two countries with deep historical ties. At present, tens of millions of people in Ukraine have been forced to leave their homeland, and the global economy has suffered as a result.In addition to keeping a close eye on Russia's every step, NATO also, in the name of safeguarding ""democracy, freedom, and human rights,"" has extended its dark hand of military intervention to the Middle East, Africa, and other regions, causing many countries to descend into war. In 1999, NATO launched an attack against Russia's traditional ally, Yugoslavia. In 2001, NATO, led by the US, launched a war in Afghanistan. After the Iraq and Libya wars broke out one after another, NATO had been ""killing and setting fires"" across the world, while the people in the invaded countries wept and mourned on the ruins of once-prosperous societies.The actions of NATO over the past decades have proven that its character, as engraved on its bones, cannot be changed, that is to despise the international system upheld by the UN at the core and the international order based on international law, turn international relations into camps, military blocs, and pan-nationalist ideology, poison regional and world peace and stability.

Graphic: Tang Tengfei/GTHeading Asia-PacificIt is worth noting that in the process of NATO's expansion, it has become more than just a military alliance. It is also a tool for West countries to promote their ""values"" and for the US to seek global hegemony. While taking advantage of the Russia-Ukraine conflict to enhance cohesion in EU, NATO has also accelerated its ""Asia-Pacific"" process. In the NATO 2030 agenda, NATO has clearly identified Japan, South Korea, New Zealand and Australia as its four major partner countries in the Asia-Pacific region.On May 5, 2022, South Korea announced its participation in the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence, becoming the first Asia country to join the organization, the Korea Herald reported. On May 16, Koji Yamazaki, chief of staff, joint staff of Japan's Self-Defense Forces, attended the NATO Military Chiefs of Defense meeting for the first time, the Nikkei reported.Where is NATO heading? Julianne Smith, the US Ambassador to NATO, revealed on June 1 that NATO plans to adopt a ""new strategic concept"" at the ongoing Madrid summit, which will list Russia as ""NATO's top priority"" and will include China as well.NATO leaders attending the meeting in Madrid should not forget that the two world wars, the Cold War between the US and the Soviet Union, and the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine have all proven with bloody facts that the Cold War mentality will only damage the global peace framework. Hegemonism and power politics will only endanger world peace, and a group confrontation will only exacerbate global security challenges.As the team leader of NATO, the US has been trying to transform NATO from a US strategic geopolitical tool in EU to its global strategic geopolitical tool in recent years.Wherever NATO's ""dark hand"" reaches, people there are irrevocably alerted.

317,GT Voice: Expanded BRICS bodes well for developing world against risks,Global Times,2022-06-28,"At a time when the world economy is facing serious challenges from a confluence of factors, including COVID-19 pandemic, the Russia-Ukraine conflict and West sanctions, many developing countries have shown a growing interest in joining BRICS, whose rising global profile has been largely overlooked by the West but is gaining popularity in the vast developing world. In the latest development, Russia Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova said on Monday that Argentina and Iran have applied to join BRICS, Russia state news agency TASS reported on Tuesday. Currently, BRICS stands for Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa - five major emerging market economies, which collectively account for 41 percent of the world's population, 24 percent of global GDP and 16 percent of international trade. But talks of BRICS expansion are gaining fresh momentum.  At the recently concluded BRICS summit, the expansion of BRICS was one of the hottest topics among participants, especially those from outside the bloc. Observers believe if more countries join BRICS, the economic bloc's global profile will undoubtedly be further enhanced. More members will bring together more resources and industrial advantages, resulting in more cooperation opportunities, which will increase the economic complementarities of the BRICS network significantly.Moreover, the increased economic strength of BRICS cooperation will better help developing countries collectively tackle various economic shocks caused by the hegemony and unilateralism of some developed countries, particularly the US, whose reckless foreign policymaking as well as inept and irresponsible domestic economic policymaking are causing havoc on the global economy, especially developing nations. Take the global food crisis as an example. An expanded BRICS could have great potential when it comes to food supply cooperation among developing countries. Argentina, which has applied to join the BRICS, is the world's biggest soybean oil and meal exporter, the second largest corn exporter, and a key global supplier of wheat. Russia is the world's largest wheat exporter; Brazil is the world's top producer and exporter of soybean; and India is one of the world's largest rice exporting countries. And China is a major importer in the international grain market. If more countries could join BRICS, the ability of the mechanism in coordinating resources to address the food problem faced by developing countries will be greatly enhanced. BRICS could establish a coordination mechanism for emergency food reserves to safeguard supply, which will be conducive to helping emerging economies and developing countries withstand any future food crisis.Likewise, in terms of energy cooperation, an expanded BRICS would also be stronger in coping with global risks. Russia and Iran, which has applied to join the BRICS, are the world's major oil producers, while China and India are major importers of crude. Also, both China and India have made significant progress when it comes to the development of the renewable energy. The participation of more countries to BRICS would bring more cooperation opportunities and enable BRICS to have a bigger influence on global energy markets in the future.Admittedly, while there are great prospects for an expanded BRICS, there is still long way to go for members in coordinating and establishing new mechanisms to not only bolster intra-bloc cooperation on a wide-range of areas clearly identified by a series of documents, including the recently adopted Beijing Declaration, but also expand cooperation with other emerging market economies and developing countries.  Moreover, for BRICS to lead and coordinate cooperation in the developing world, a great deal of groundwork is necessary in a long list of areas, including financial payment systems, currency swap arrangements, coordination of resource reserves. However, the daunting tasks ahead do not mean the mission is not worth pursuing. In fact, with all that's going on in the world, a more united and stronger developing world against West dominance and exploitation led by the US is worth striving for more than ever.",SOURCE,GT VOICE,BRICS File photo: VCG,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'COVID - 19': ('MISC', 1), 'West': ('MISC', 2), 'Russia': ('LOC', 5), 'Ukraine': ('LOC', 1), 'Argentina': ('LOC', 2), 'Iran': ('LOC', 1), 'Brazil': ('LOC', 2), 'India': ('LOC', 2), 'China': ('LOC', 2), 'South Africa': ('LOC', 1), 'US': ('LOC', 1), 'BRICS': ('ORG', 11), 'Ministry': ('ORG', 1), 'TASS': ('ORG', 1), 'BRIC': ('ORG', 2), 'Maria Zakharova': ('PER', 1)}"
318,"Iran, Argentina’s applications to BRICS underscores pursuit of development, solidarity",GT staff reporters,2022-06-28,"Iran's application to the BRICS mechanism, following a similar move by  Argentina, is a move that China analysts believe underscores the pursuit by developing and emerging countries of development not disturbance, of true multilateralism not ideological confrontations, and of solidarity not division.The expansion of the BRICS group of Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa will also help amplify peaceful power to stabilize the international order at a time when small cliques and unilateral sanctions have been weaponized based on geopolitical considerations, analysts pointed out. Iran has formally submitted its application to become a member of the BRICS family. ""BRICS countries have played a vital role in practicing true multilateralism and promoting unity and strength among developing countries. Iran stands ready to offer all its resources and advantages, including energy reserves, human resources and scientific achievements, to help the BRICS countries achieve their goals,"" read a statement that the Iran Embassy sent to the Global Times on Tuesday. ""Iran is a sustainable and trustworthy partner of BRICS countries,"" it said.On Monday, the Iran Foreign Ministry spokesperson Saeed Khatibzadeh was also cited by Iran newspaper Kayhan as saying that a series of consultations on Iran's application to join BRICS have been held in this regard.While attending a series of meetings during last week's BRICS summit, the Iran President Ebrahim Raisi expressed the country's readiness to share its vast capabilities to help BRICS attain its goals. Argentina's President Alberto Fernandez also said that his country is ready to become a full member of BRICS.In responding to Iran and Argentina's applications to BRICS, China Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian told a press conference on Tuesday that since its establishment, the destiny of BRICS and new emerging and developing countries have been closely interwoven. China, with this year's BRICS' chairmanship, actively supports the mechanism's expansion. At the BRICS summit on June 23, leaders of the BRICS countries also agreed to discuss the standards and procedures to expand the family.  Feng Xingke, secretary general of the World Financial Forum and director of the Center for BRICS and Global Governance, told the Global Times that apart from Iran and Argentina which had previously expressed willingness to join BRICS, more and more countries have also shown interest in joining the mechanism, which demonstrates the allure BRICS has for new emerging countries as a system to seek common ground for development.Feng noted that including Iran in BRICS will mean closer and more effective channels between resources and markets, which will benefit all members. Argentina, as a representative of new emerging economies, will also help promote cooperation between BRICS and other regional countries in Latin US. Argentina's Ambassador to China Sabino Vaca Narvaja told the Global Times in an earlier interview that Argentina hopes to become a BRICS member as soon as possible. He noted that the BRICS cooperation system has profound significance for the building of a more balanced global order where cooperation will be unconditional and mutually beneficial. If Argentina joins BRICS, this move would also be conductive to the further development of China-Latin US relations, he said. Argentina's Ambassador to China Sabino Vaca Narvaja told the Global Times in an earlier interview that Argentina hopes to become a BRICS member as soon as possible. He noted that the BRICS cooperation system has profound significance for the building of a more balanced global order where cooperation will be unconditional and mutually beneficial. If Argentina joins BRICS, this move would also be conductive to the further development of China-Latin US relations, he said. Pakistan on Monday congratulated China on its successful hosting of the BRICS meetings, appreciating China's role in promoting the interests of the developing countries including Pakistan. Being the host country, China engaged with Pakistan prior to the BRICS meetings, where decisions are taken after consultations with all BRICS members, the foreign ministry statement said.""We do hope that future engagement of the organization would be based on the principles of inclusivity keeping in view the overall interests of the developing world and in a manner that is devoid of narrow geopolitical considerations,"" said the statement.""Regrettably one member blocked Pakistan's participation,"" The Hindu reported on Monday, citing Pakistan's Foreign Office. Though the office did not name any country, it was apparently referring to India, given the history of the relationship between the two nations, the report said. As BRICS is not a treaty, any application to join in needs to be discussed among the five founding members. Whether the applicants will be firstly listed as observers or will have to undergo other protocols to obtain membership status will be decided by the members, Feng explained.The expansion of BRICS was a heated topic during the just-concluded 14th BRICS Summit last week. China Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin told a press conference on June 24 that as the BRICS chair country, China actively supports the BRICS in starting the membership expansion process and expanding the BRICS Plus cooperation, additionally China will encourage all BRICS parties to formulate standards and procedures for membership expansion based on consensus.Currently, BRICS countries represent 40 percent of the world population, account for 25 percent of the global economy and 18 percent of world trade, and contribute 50 percent to the world's economic growth.Although BRICS has not added new members over recent years, the BRICS Plus mechanism, which was first promoted in 2017, has offered an effective and successful system to link new emerging economies, BRICS countries and developing countries and to build consensus on how to deal with challenges to global development and how to achieve sustainable development, Wang Lei, director of the Center for BRICS Cooperation Studies at Beijing Normal University, told the Global Times. Wang explained that in previous years, different representatives of developing countries and new emerging economies have been invited to attend past BRICS meetings. For example, in 2017, Egypt, Mexico, the Republic of Guinea, Tajikistan and Thailand were invited to attend the BRICS meeting held in Xiamen, the capital city of China's Fujian Province, marking that BRICS Plus cooperation has surpassed regional limitations. Feng pointed out that the expansion of the BRICS Plus cooperation globally has also prepared BRICS to include more members. Moreover, the New Development Bank (NDB), a multilateral financial institution established in 2015 by BRICS countries included Bangladesh, the UAE, Uruguay and Egypt in 2021. The allure of the BRICS group and the BRICS Plus cooperation has increased with its success in pushing concrete development. By promoting solidarity within new emerging economies and developing countries, it allows these countries to jointly push forward the reform of global governance, consolidate the UN' core position in the international order, promote global peace and stability, uphold true multilateralism and globalization and protect the interests of developing countries, Wang said. On Monday, commenting on Iran and Argentina's applications to the BRICS, Russia Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman Maria Zakharova wrote on her Telegram channel that ""While the White House was thinking what to disconnect, ban or spoil in the world, Argentina and Iran applied for joining BRICS,"" Russia news agency TASS reported. The BRICS group also represents a similar stance to that of other developing countries and new emerging economies, opposing ideological confrontations and a new cold war, Feng said, noting that emerging economies pay more attention on issues such as food crisis, security, post-pandemic economic recovery and global financial stability against the backdrop of the Russia-Ukraine conflicts. Compared with US-led cliques such as G7 and NATO, which bring no solutions to the severe challenges facing the world, all the while attempting to foment global discord, analysts noted that BRICS group stands higher and sees further, representing the future of the world, a future characterized by more emerging economies aiming to promote global progress through development.",CHINA,DIPLOMACY,BRICS File photo: VCG,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'Iran': ('LOC', 11), 'Argentina': ('LOC', 4), 'China': ('LOC', 4), 'Brazil': ('LOC', 1), 'Russia': ('LOC', 1), 'India': ('LOC', 1), 'South Africa': ('LOC', 1), 'BRICS': ('ORG', 17), 'Global Times': ('ORG', 2), 'Foreign Ministry': ('ORG', 2), 'Kayhan': ('ORG', 1), 'Xi': ('ORG', 1), 'World': ('ORG', 1), 'Forum': ('ORG', 1), 'Center': ('ORG', 1), 'Saeed Khatibzadeh': ('PER', 1), 'Ebrahim Raisi': ('PER', 1), 'Alberto Fernandez': ('PER', 1), 'Zhao Lijian': ('PER', 1), 'Feng': ('PER', 1)}"
319,"US eyes Russia, China at G7 summit amid woes at home",Deng Xiaoci,2022-06-27,"Aiming to keep pressure on Russia and seek solidarity to cope with challenges from so-called systemic rival China, the G7 summit is convening in southern Germany, as leaders of the group including US President Joe Biden began arriving on Saturday afternoon local time. According to media reports, leaders of the world's seven most industrialized countries are gathering in the Bavarian alpine resort of Elmau Castle, with the topics of the discussion including a possible cap on Russia oil imports and reaching agreements on banning imports of gold from Russia. Joe Biden tweeted on Sunday that ""Together, the G7 will announce that we will ban the import of Russia gold, a major export that rakes in tens of billions of dollars for Russia."" The US Treasury Department will issue a determination Tuesday to prohibit the import of new gold into the US, which the CNN source said would ""further isolate Russia from the global economy by preventing its participation in the gold market.""Xi Jinping Junyang, a professor at the Shanghai University of Finance and Economics, said that it is possible the world's two major gold exchange centers in the US and UK will cut gold trading with Russia. ""Unlike oil and natural gas, West countries' demands for gold are not rigid, and their sources of gold are much more diversified,"" Xi Jinping told the Global Times, adding that the ban on Russia gold will further raise gold prices and drive up inflation.But some experts also noted that similar to energy products, Russia could reduce the impact of West bans by turning to emerging markets to trade gold.Veteran macroeconomist Tian Yun told the Global Times on Sunday that the new sanctions would have limited impact on Russia's economy, much smaller compared with previous rounds of sanctions. According to Tian, against the background of global energy price hike, Russia crude oil has become a ""hard currency."" Even if EU, the US or Japan does not buy oil from Russia, other countries will still purchase it. In fact, West countries' sanctions on Russia oil will only make emerging markets benefit more from energy trading, such as getting discounts from Russia traders. He also noted that to curb global inflation by sanctioning such a heavyweight global energy exporter is a totally wrong decision, as one important reason for the current inflation is because the recovery of supply chains is lagging behind the recovery of demand, especially under the liquidity expansion policies of the US and other central banks. Lin Boqiang, director of the China Center for Energy Economics Research at Xiamen University, told the Global Times that West countries' idea of putting a cap on Russia oil would be ""unfeasible"" in reality. ""As long as the governments allow businesses to trade with Russia exporters, the so-called cap is hard to implement,"" Lin said. According to him, the measures reflect a paradoxical mindset of many West countries, as they want to punish Russia while also want cheap oil. But this is hard to obtain at the same time.Sanction harmful to all UN chief Antonio Guterres urged Friday to take practical steps to stabilize food markets and reduce commodity price volatility. Guterres said in a video message to a meeting of officials from around the world in Berlin on Friday that ""we face an unprecedented global hunger crisis."" Guterres said there could be no effective solution to the crisis unless Ukraine and Russia, which produce about 29 percent of global wheat exports, find a way to properly resume trade.Shipments from Ukraine ports have been halted. Moscow wants certain West sanctions lifted in order to resume its grain and fertilizer exports. The UN and Turkey are trying to broker a deal, Reuters reported. West powers are grappling with several crises, including surging inflation and energy prices. In the US, inflation has hit 8.6 percent, while the UK has registered inflation of 9.1 percent year-on-year, and in the eurozone, the number has hiked to 8.1 percent, media reported. Russia President Vladimir Putin has blasted the West for trying to shift blame for the skyrocketing inflation, saying that it is the result of many years of irresponsible macroeconomic policy of the G7 countries.""Chen Jia, a research fellow at the International Monetary Institute of the Renmin University of China, told the Global Times that the core reason for the EU's high inflation is that in the past years, the US-led world order, particularly geo-politics, is becoming more and more chaotic. According to a CNBC report, core inflation excluding food and energy rose 6 percent in May in the US from one year ago. In comparison, core consumer prices in the eurozone excluding energy, food, alcohol and tobacco increased to 3.8 percent in May from 3.5 percent in April, according to tradingeconomics.com. Chen said that although the EU's energy inflation had shown signs ahead of the Ukraine crisis, it was after the EU largely slashed energy imports from Russia that the region's energy inflation level surged to an unprecedented level. ""It's without doubt that the accelerating inflation speed is caused by the energy sanctions after the Russia-Ukraine crisis,"" Chen noted.Anti-China agendaAlready having many problems ranging from galloping domestic inflation to a looming food crisis and energy shortages, the US is still promoting its anti-China agenda of seeking bloc politics and camp confrontation against China, and according to the White House on Saturday, the G7 leaders will address ""what they see as China's use of forced labor and intellectual property theft and other issues.""The G7 summit and the imminent NATO Summit in Madrid, Spain, would very likely be Joe Biden's last dance in EU, as the Democrats will probably lose the midterm election in November. Joe Biden is making a final charge to convince and rally EU leaders to come onboard the anti-China chariot, Wang Yiwei, director of the Institute of International Affairs at the Renmin University of China, told the Global Times.The US will exploit topics related to Russia to push for its ultimate goal of containing and competing with China in order to maintain its hegemonic status in the world, Wang noted.The CNN report spelled out the US' logic as Russia's special operation in Ukraine has amplified Joe Biden's oft-spoken warnings of autocracies versus democracies, and Joe Biden would hope to convince fellow leaders to take a tougher line toward China and make China's ""coercive economic practices"" a bigger topic of conversation"" than during last year's G7 summit.The US is using political and ideological narratives to abduct EU, as it has realized its power is significantly waning and it is impossible to take on China on its own in a fair competition, Wang said. It is a stark contrast between the confrontation-focused G7 Summit and the inclusive and open BRICS Summit that just concluded and was hosted by China as the group's rotating chair this year, analysts said.Such differences showcase conflicts of the fossilized civilization of the US-led West powers and the emerging economies. And it is apparent to all that the West cold-war mentality is not in line with the times' theme of peace and development, nor with the common will of people, Wang said. About 4,000 protesters gathered in Munich as the G7 powers prepared to hold their annual gathering in Germany's Bavarian Alps, local media reported. Organizers said they hoped to mobilize up to 20,000 protesters in the Bavarian city and were disappointed by the initial low turnout at Munich's Theresienwiese park, Germany news agency dpa reported.

321,"With respect and equality, BRICS walks on the road of a new civilization",Wang Wen,2022-06-27,"In recent days, I have read some media reports about the just-concluded 14th BRICS Summit, and I found in these reports that there was an obvious tendency to deviate from the facts.BRICS is not an anti-West camp, nor is it a group to fight the West. The keywords of this year's BRICS meeting are ""development,"" ""cooperation,"" ""stability"" and ""peace,"" which aim to bring the world back on the right track.Peace and development are the original mainstream of the global situation, but the US has led it astray. The Russia-Ukraine conflict is also purposefully misled by the US. Now BRICS is bringing back the right track, telling the world on behalf of more than 170 developing countries and regions that we want development, cooperation, stability and peace.In China President Xi Jinping's remarks at the High-level Dialogue on Global Development on the next day after the BRICS Summit's opening, his first sentence goes, ""Development is a timeless theme for humanity."" Then he sincerely said that ""only through continuous development can the people's dream for a better life and social stability be realized.""Today, the West is engaging in protectionism, small cliques, maximum sanctions and decoupling, which are obviously leading the whole world into the gutter. From this perspective, the greatest significance of the BRICS Summit this time is to have reached an international consensus to promote development. This is the right track of the world and of humanity.Some media said that BRICS wants to engage in a different camp from the West. This is obviously wishful thinking, bringing BRICS down to the same level as the West. The position of BRICS is much higher than that of G7.In terms of the Russia-Ukraine situation, the West media also has misunderstandings about the BRICS mechanism. The position of the 14th BRICS Summit Beijing Declaration is not to help Russia fight the West, but to make peace, engage in negotiations, and truly have humanitarian concerns for Ukraine.The US did not do any of this. The US in fact hopes that the Russia-Ukraine conflict will continue. It is in line with the US' interests to let Russia and Ukraine continue to fight for a long time. Arming the Ukrainians, rather than providing real humanitarian aid, is an important proof that the US wants the two countries to continue their fighting. The US is hypocritical. It is BRICS that really wants to resolve the situation in Russia and Ukraine.The 14th BRICS Summit Beijing Declaration gives Russia enough face as well as pressure. The so-called saving face means that the declaration mentioned only ""the situation in Ukraine,"" and it did not use the phrase ""Russia-Ukraine conflict."" The declaration also commends the discussions during the Meeting of BRICS Ministers of Foreign Affairs/International Relations on May COVID-19 and the 12th Meeting of BRICS National Security Advisers and High Representatives on National Security on June 15. The declaration reaffirms the UN's sole authority for imposing sanctions, which means saying no to the US-style sanctions. These are all responses to Russia's concerns.But on the other hand, the BRICS system has given Russia three types of pressures that Russia itself has to agree with. The first is to emphasize peaceful settlement of differences and disputes between countries through dialogue and consultation. The second, as noted in the declaration, is that ""we support talks between Russia and Ukraine."" This also shows that Russia is willing to negotiate. The third is to discuss the humanitarian concerns for Ukraine.However, BRICS is still the most trustworthy reliance for Russia. It will not harm Russia. All BRICS countries are increasing oil imports and conducting normal trade, and they have not followed West sanctions. These countries are the warmest and sincerest friends of Russia on the international stage. But such friends are not fair-weather friends. If you beat others and some people cheer for you, then they are very likely to be fair-weather friends. Those who say you should not be impulsive and who persuade you to negotiate are real friends.India's role is equally worthy of recognition. India has always been wooed by the West, but this time, it did not follow the West. This approach is correct.India strategists should believe that India cannot become a vassal of the West. By roping in India, the West only wants it to return to its second-tier role under the colonial system of the past. Compared with being in the West camp, India can enjoy the role of a great power that owns equality and dignity more in the BRICS system.And such equality, justice and mutual respect are the symbol that BRICS represents the future of the world. BRICS is not to rebuild a military alliance, nor to walk again on the path of the G7, or to form a small faction to fight against another. Instead, it hopes that the humanity will walk on the road of a new civilization.The author is professor and executive dean of Chongyang Institute for Financial Studies at Renmin University of China. wangwen2013@ruc.edu.cn",OPINION,COLUMNISTS,BRICS File photo: VCG,Author title not found,Wang Wen is professor and executive dean of Chongyang Institute for Financial Studies at Renmin University of China.,"{'14th BRICS Summit': ('MISC', 2), 'Dialogue on Global Development': ('MISC', 1), 'BRICS Summit': ('MISC', 3), 'Ukrainian': ('MISC', 1), 'BRICS': ('ORG', 8), 'G7': ('ORG', 1), 'West': ('LOC', 7), 'US': ('LOC', 6), 'Russia': ('LOC', 5), 'Ukraine': ('LOC', 5), 'China': ('LOC', 1), 'Beijing': ('LOC', 1), 'Xi Jinping': ('PER', 1)}"
322,West's lecturing approach toward Hong Kong a result of its failure to grasp HK is part of China,Global Times,2022-06-27,"Editor's Note:This year marks the 25th anniversary of Hong Kong's return to the motherland. Despite the West interference in Hong Kong affairs over the decades, especially in the past three years, Hong Kong has become peaceful and stable, and will remain that way, thanks to the implementation of the National Security Law for Hong Kong. How should we view the China central government's thinking and policies in governing Hong Kong since the implementation of the National Security Law for Hong Kong?  What led to the defeat of West interventionism? Global Times (Global Times) reporter Wang Wenwen talked to Richard Cullen (Cullen), a visiting professor with the Law Faculty of the University of Hong Kong, over these issues.Global Times: Could you talk about the changes in Hong Kong taking place between when you first arrived in Hong Kong and now? What is your deepest feeling?Cullen: I first arrived in Hong Kong in November 1991, 30 years ago. I've spent some years back in Australia, but I've been in Hong Kong more than 25 years. I think the obvious changes are material changes, like the MTR [Hong Kong's subway system] which is now much bigger with several more lines going to many more places, and the new buildings and things like that.I had a really good feeling about Hong Kong when I first arrived. I thought it was a marvelous place to visit and to come and live. Here I am now 30 years later, and it still seems just as marvelous. I really love Hong Kong, so I think that's my deepest feeling. I liked it very much at the outset, and I love it even more today.Global Times: How do you summarize the changes of the China central government's thinking and policies in governing Hong Kong since the implementation of the National Security Law for Hong Kong? How effective are they?Cullen: I think I've come to realize, going back before 2019, that Beijing's responses to Hong Kong have been relatively ""hands off."" And its responses affecting Hong Kong have been in reaction to what happened in Hong Kong and they have been relatively limited. After 2019 and the insurrection, we've seen, increasingly, a much more hands-on response, but it's still a reaction to what's happened. The National Security Law [for Hong Kong], when I look at it and look at the provisions, I can see how it was largely drafted to address real problems that arose during the very serious insurrection in 2019, which grew out of several major protest marches. So it's a reaction to the watershed event in Hong Kong. I think it has been effective. It's a radical change, there's no question about that, to the legal framework in Hong Kong. But it has been effective and very important to help restore stability. And I think it will continue to act to underpin stability in Hong Kong. The National Security Law has played a very important role in making Hong Kong safe again.I would say the NSL so far remains relatively minimal in its impact. I think some of the extreme and radical protesters were hoping there would be a military intervention in Hong Kong from the PLA or the people's armed police. That's been completely avoided. The solution that's been found is legal and constitutional. On balance, this hands-on approach has been necessary - and a good thing - for Hong Kong.Global Times: The democratic development of Hong Kong under the ""one country, two systems"" has its inherent historical logic, institutional logic and practical logic. Why do you think the West does not understand or try to understand the democracy in Hong Kong?Cullen: I think one of the aspects underpinning this attitude really is historical, both for the UK and the US and the Europeans generally in their relationship with Hong Kong.There's a well-known book by a quite famous journalist called Richard Hughes, who was an Australia as I am. He lived in Hong Kong for many years. And indeed he reported from China before 1949. In his book Hong Kong, Borrowed Place, Borrowed Time, he said, in 1968, on page one, that ""Hong Kong is China."" He was very, very experienced and he was reportedly a part-time UK secret agent as well. But he had a very clear view that ""Hong Kong is China."" I think that has been difficult for certain people to accept. Some leading commentators seem to see Hong Kong, even today, as a kind of international concession city that ultimately belongs to China but is subject to some level of control or influence by leading Anglo-EU powers.So there has been a problem adjusting to the reality that ""Hong Kong is China"" or is part of China. And we're still going through the process of making this adjustment, at least for some leading commentators, including the last governor of Hong Kong, who developed a special and genuine affection for Hong Kong, but also developed a kind of proprietary feeling about Hong Kong, which I think is not appropriate.

Richard Cullen Photo: Courtesy of Richard CullenGT: In the past three years, Hong Kong governance has been subject to West interference, but Hong Kong has managed to shake off the turmoil and restore the social order. What do you think of the defeat of West interventionism? Do you think the US and some West countries will continue to use the Hong Kong-related affairs to put pressure on the China central government in the future? What form might it be?Cullen: I think it's a pity that we came to the point where things got so bad in 2019 that measures like the National Security Law [for Hong Kong] - and the electoral reforms as well - were needed. I'm not pleased that we came to that point, but these remedies were needed as the turmoil in Hong Kong at that time was so great. I'm sure not all within the opposition agreed with what was going on, but no one within that group did anything to stop the turmoil. The broad opposition seemed to be basically controlled by its most extreme elements. They seemed to have no way of controlling and organizing their own behavior in a rational and civil way. And so we had constant riots, fire bombs and so on. So we needed the remedies which were put in place. I do think that pressure will continue to be put on Hong Kong by those who want to contain the rise of China. This is a very big project led by the US, in which it has tried to get many other countries to participate. So there will continue to be pressure on Hong Kong, certainly a lot of critical pressure. And I would expect to see that that pressure might be intensified over the coming months as there will be a new government in Hong Kong. So those most opposed to the rise of China may aim to intensify criticism of the new [HKSAR] government to make its life more difficult as it commences its job of governing Hong Kong.I think there's a lot of lobbying and pressure in the US and the West to increase the use of sanction measures to apply more pressure on Hong Kong officials. I think this is a great pity. West interference is misguided at the very least. But unfortunately it is to be expected. A number of West people have a very strong attachment to Hong Kong and a very high regard for Hong Kong, but they do not accept in the way they should that Hong Kong is fundamentally part of China. They regularly talk in ways which suggest that Hong Kong has some kind of special, separated status within China, which gives them permission to interfere, in extreme cases, and to make continuous comments about how Hong Kong should be run according to West political norms, which they advance.And really, they've got so much to deal with in their own backyards that needs political attention, whether it's the US, the UK or EU with a major war now raging within EU. And yet they still find all this time to lecture Hong Kong.This lecturing approach connects back to the historical period of Hong Kong under UK rule and to the fact that the people who make these instructing comments have difficulty coming to terms with the reality that Hong Kong is now completely confirmed as part of China. The West - led by the US - and China should be putting far more emphasis on cooperating to deal with major global issues, including global warming, managing COVID-19 pandemic and the huge economic pressures which are emerging related to economic performance and inflation, and also the world needs to deal, together, with the terrible war in Ukraine. We need to find a way to secure a cease-fire so that serious negotiations can begin.Global Times: In your article for other media, you indicate that the EU adopted double standard toward Hong Kong secessionist forces and forces who have tried to secure independence from Spain for Catalonia. What do you think this double standard will lead to in EU? Will the separatist trend rise in EU?Cullen: First, EU does seem to have brought the biggest, violent separatist problems under control. So it appears to have better control of separatism now than the EU had 20-30 years ago. But the EU impulse to lecture Hong Kong and China about how Hong Kong should be run indicates, frankly, a lack of clear thinking. And you need clear thinking for positive problem-solving. So, when I observe such poorly informed EU thinking applied to US here in Hong Kong, I hope that the EU is thinking more clearly about their many problems in EU.Interestingly, perhaps the most significant separatist problem, at the moment, is now outside the EU: I see that there are further calls in Scotland for another referendum to see if Scotland should become an independent country somehow separated from the United Kingdom.This is happening after Brexit has seen the UK leave the EU. I don't know whether this new call to create a separate Scotland will be successful or not and there are legal arguments about whether Scotland can go ahead and hold such a referendum without permission from London. But let's suppose Scotland does hold a referendum and the referendum says Scotland should separate from England and Wales and leave the United Kingdom and become a separate country. It does occur to me that this will be quite a big headache for the EU, because, presumably, the EU will then be approached by Scotland to see if Scotland can join the EU as a new member. But if Scotland were to leave the UK without full agreement at least in London, then this puts the EU in a difficult position, because it surely does not want to be seen to be encouraging separatism in the UK.In summary, I think it would be a very good idea for the US, EU and the UK to put most of the continuous effort they put into criticizing the way that Hong Kong is run - and the role of Beijing - into trying to solve these many problems within their own backyards.",OPINION,VIEWPOINT,Photo: IC,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'Hong Kong': ('LOC', 19), 'China': ('LOC', 2), 'Australia': ('LOC', 1), 'Beijing': ('LOC', 1), 'West': ('MISC', 2), 'National Security Law': ('MISC', 5), 'Global Times': ('ORG', 4), 'Law Faculty': ('ORG', 1), 'University of Hong Kong': ('ORG', 1), 'MTR': ('ORG', 1), 'Wang Wenwen': ('PER', 1), 'Richard Cullen': ('PER', 4)}"
323,NATO’s strained capability not matched by strength,Timofei Bordachev,2022-06-27,"Editor's Note:NATO, which is constantly looking for imaginary enemies and justifying its existence by inciting confrontation, is about to hold a summit, and it also plans to extend its tentacles to the Asia-Pacific region. Behind its aggressive narrative, contradictions and divisions within NATO have become increasingly prominent. The Russia-Ukraine conflict is not going according to NATO's playbook. This series of articles will provide some clues regarding NATO's predicament. This is the fourth piece.Despite all the investment in the conflict, NATO is not able to stop Russia from fulfilling the goals of its military operation in Ukraine. That gives Moscow the possibility to regulate the intensity of the military activities on the ground accordingly to Russia's own planning and strategic considerations. Very soon, the US and its allies will have to face a choice between the different ways of recognizing Russia's legitimate security considerations in EU. The reason for this dilemma is simple - NATO, governed by the US, has long ago overstretched its actual capabilities which cannot be matched by its strength. In recent months, NATO allies have sent colossal financial resources to the Ukraine government and imposed the most severe economic sanctions on Russia ever used in international politics. The number of weapons that were transferred to Kiev is enough to equip the army of a small EU or Asia country. There are also several thousand mercenaries from NATO countries in Ukraine - all of them trained fighters with combat experience. Some EU NATO allies admit that they have already exhausted all stocks of their military equipment available. Delivering new supplies to Kiev will need a significant production effort that will take months or even years.     Sometimes one even gets the impression that Ukraine is becoming for NATO what the war in Afghanistan (1979-89) became for the Soviet Union - a huge waste of resources for the sake of the goal which is both incomprehensible and far from the interests of citizens. Ordinary people in EU and in the US fully understand that Russia is not threatening their home countries or essential interests. And we can expect that in the fall, the people of the NATO countries will begin to ask their governments questions - Why should they have to further endure economic difficulties? So, NATO's failure does not only stay on the battlefield - it seems an entire US post-Cold War strategy is doomed to collapse. And the US will need to adjust its own vision of global order with that of the other members of the international community. The expansion of NATO after the end of the Cold War looked like an easy and funny game. Russia was willing to cooperate with the West and weakened by the painful economic and societal reforms during the 1990s. The aggressive NATO expansion was the result of excessive self-confidence by the US and the desire to seize as much territory as possible after the disintegration of the Soviet Union. Instead of using the opportunity for the joint international effort to establish a just world order, the West has tried to maximize its advantages. As we see it today - at the expense of global stability and its own credibility as a security provider.   Even by the early 1990s, many analysts argued that NATO's expansion had not taken into consideration the strategic implications for the bloc itself. Many responsible thinkers in the US and EU cautioned the necessity of such a decision, warning that it will not only antagonize Russia but also put the US' own reliability at risk if Moscow challenges NATO on the ground. However, these warnings have not been heard by the subsequent US administrations. Basically, the only possible scenario was reliant on the ever-lasting US global dominance and inability of the others to confront NATO with anything but words. It worked for several decades - all NATO military operations after the Cold War have been directed against much weaker and isolated countries such as the former Yugoslavia (1999), Afghanistan (2001) and Libya (2011). But present-day events have confirmed that it was unrealistic from the very beginning. Even though NATO will now increase its military presence in EU, it still by all estimates will not be enough to represent a conventional challenge for Russia. EU NATO countries such as France, Germany and Italy are already calling for the peace-settlement in Ukraine. They have neither the desire nor resources to increase the level of engagement in the ongoing conflict. So, recklessly putting ambitions before the rational calculation, the US places itself into a position of further losing its credibility as a leader of the West community. This is not to speak about the internal US troubles ranging from the substantial COVID-19 consequences to consumer prices rise and race problems.     The author is Moscow-based Valdai Club program director. opinion@globaltimes.com.cn",OPINION,VIEWPOINT,Illustration: Carlos Latuff,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'NATO': ('ORG', 12), 'EU': ('ORG', 3), 'EU NATO': ('ORG', 16), 'Asia': ('LOC', 2), 'Pacific': ('LOC', 1), 'Russia': ('LOC', 6), 'Ukraine': ('LOC', 5), 'Moscow': ('LOC', 1), 'US': ('LOC', 5), 'Kiev': ('LOC', 2), 'Afghanistan': ('LOC', 1), 'Soviet Union': ('LOC', 1)}"

325,EU should avoid being 'junior partner' of US: former Belgian prime minister,Global Times,2022-06-27,"Editor's Note: The ongoing Ukraine crisis, triggered by the US-led NATO's repeated eastward expansion, has aroused reflection on the international security system among the international community. The unilateralist security architecture dominated by the US has brought a great deal of conflict and instability to the world. The new era calls for a new security. How will the China-proposed Global Security Initiative contribute to global security? What is the take of a EU toward NATO's five rounds of eastward expansion? Yves Leterme (Leterme), former Belgian prime minister, shared his insights on these topics with Global Times (Global Times) reporter Lu Yuanzhi. Leterme also shared his view on different approaches toward COVID-19 epidemic control among different countries. Global Times: The Russia-Ukraine conflict is now the focus across the world. From a non-EU perspective, NATO's eastward expansion to Russia's doorstep is the root of the Ukraine crisis. As a EU, what's your take on the bloc's five rounds of eastward expansion?Leterme: I represented Belgium at the NATO-Summit in Bucharest in 2008 when different former nations that were part of the Soviet bloc were awarded NATO-Membership Application Programs. The demand for NATO membership was tabled by the leaders of these new independent nations. The fact that the expansion of NATO came quite early after the collapse of the Soviet system certainly created some legitimate concerns and resentment outside of EU and the US.However, these concerns can never be used as an argument for the unacceptable, unilateral aggression and violation of the territorial integrity of Ukraine as a sovereign country by President [Vladimir] Vladimir Putin.  Global Times: China President Xi Jinping in April proposed a Global Security Initiative which stressed a commitment to the vision of common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security.

I agree with the need for a new global security and with the underpinning principles put forward. I hope that leaders from all over the globe will join the debate and agree on a strengthened multilateral framework that can be a guarantor of the six principles and of the global security. China is the key partner to make lasting peace prevail.Global Times: Some EU leaders underline EU's strategic autonomy. How do you see the prospect of EU strategic autonomy? Against the backdrop of EU's pursuit of strategic autonomy, what's your opinion about the future of China-EU cooperation?Leterme: I think the EU should - notwithstanding the productive cooperation and strong ties - avoid being just a ""junior partner"" of the US. The EU needs to take own positions in the interests of its citizens and in order to rebuild strong and better-balanced global multilateral cooperation. The EU is part of the Eurasian continent. Given the impressive progress made by China in all domains and the leading role of China in the future of the world, it is in the interest of the Europeans to deepen the cooperation with China. This must be one of the leading principles of the EU position in global affairs. The goal of deepening the friendship and cooperation with China should prevail over the differences in opinion that sometimes create turbulences in the EU-China relations. Some EU politicians should invest more in a sincere, respectful and open-minded interaction with China. The opening of China to the world and the increasing role China is taking up in multilateral organizations should be better welcomed.Global Times: You posted a piece entitled ""COVID-19's lessons for democracies"" this March. The novel coronavirus has resulted in 15 million deaths across the world. Do you think democracies have learned sufficient lessons to better deal with COVID-19 in the future?Leterme: It is a fact that West democracies have been reacting with some avoidable delay to the extremely rapid spread of COVID-19. This has certainly led to human suffering and economic damage that could have been prevented.Democracies have a very important self-correcting dynamic. Lessons have been learned from the pandemic and are leading to better preparedness to counter future health crises. I am advocating for a systematic review of emergency planning and increased capacity of effective risk and disaster management.Global Times: When the number of Omicron infections worldwide is ramping up, most West countries have reopened their economies. In the absence of full knowledge of the novel coronavirus, do you think that adopting some measures to control and prevent the spread of the virus is still necessary?Leterme: In most cases, the policy to counter the spread of the pandemic and the human suffering and casualties has been based on striking a balance between the need to effectively counter and overcome the pandemic through very tough restrictions and on the other hand, trying as much as possible to safeguard the continuity of the core activities of the societies and the functioning of vital parts of the economy. It is good that even today there are still some limitations to free movement and mandatory protection measures like masks and vaccines. We should be prepared for a surge of the number of infections.Global Times: The US co-hosted the second Global COVID-19 Summit in May. It has also long passed the mark of more than 1 million COVID-19-related deaths, the highest figure of any country. What's your take on this?Leterme: The US has indeed been very severely hit. To a certain extent this is due to a kind of denial at the beginning of the pandemic and the priority given to the further functioning of the economy. Then president of the US, Mr Donald Trump, also made effective measures against the spread of the virus more difficult by erratic communication.Global Times: During the epidemic, it seems that developed West countries have not showed their due leadership toward the world. Instead, they have displayed some chaotic, selfish moves. This seems to have resulted in damage to the West's overall image. What is your opinion on the ability of West countries to provide public goods in the future?Leterme: Analyzing the way the needs of the developing countries have been addressed, it is clear that more solidarity could have been displayed. I have, together with colleagues, been asking for an exceptional lifting of the intellectual property rights on the vaccines that were quite rapidly produced by the pharmaceutical industry. COVID-19 virus has also turned out to be an inequality virus. Within our West societies, poorer people were more exposed to infection and people with lower-paid jobs had to face the potential risk and could not work from home. Protection against infection through vaccination has not yet been sufficiently and fairly spread over the world. The developing world is still lagging behind. This is very worrying, not the least since no world citizen is 100 percent safe until everybody is safe. West countries could indeed do more to make vaccines and other prevention accessible as public goods.",OPINION,VIEWPOINT,Former Belgian prime minister Yves Leterme Photo: Courtesy of Leterme,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'Ukraine': ('LOC', 4), 'China': ('LOC', 3), 'Russia': ('LOC', 2), 'Belgium': ('LOC', 1), 'Bucharest': ('LOC', 1), 'US': ('MISC', 4), 'Global Security Initiative': ('MISC', 2), 'Belgian': ('MISC', 1), 'COVID': ('MISC', 1), '19': ('MISC', 1), 'non': ('MISC', 1), 'NATO - Summit': ('MISC', 1), 'Soviet': ('MISC', 2), 'Membership': ('MISC', 1), 'NATO': ('ORG', 6), 'EU': ('ORG', 4), 'Global Times': ('ORG', 2), 'Yves Leterme': ('PER', 3), 'Lu Yuanzhi': ('PER', 1), 'Vladimir Putin': ('PER', 2), 'Xi Jinping': ('PER', 1), 'Xi Jin': ('PER', 2)}"
326,The era of humiliation of China is decisively over: Aussie sinologist,Global Times,2022-06-26,"Editor's Note:During the past decade, the world has increasingly witnessed a trend of ""the East is rising, and the West is declining"" in the spheres of economy, security and discourse power. West countries, particularly the US, plagued by internal woes, have sought the old path of passing the buck and instigating turmoil elsewhere to ease their own pressure. China, representative of the emerging countries, is proposing the new solutions to global problems. By advocating win-win development, facilitating consultation and reconciliation and proposing a balanced and effective security mechanism, China is striving to build a community with a shared future for mankind.In the third of the series, Colin Patrick Mackerras (Mackerras), an Australia sinologist and Emeritus Professor at Griffith University, shared with the Global Times how he views China's development and changes over the past decades, especially the past 10 years. He believes the balance of geopolitical and economic power between the US and China over the last several decades has changed significantly in China's favor and it is the Communist Party of China (CPC) that gives China the stability many countries lack.Global Times: Do you remember when China President Xi Jinping talked about your contribution to the development of China-Australia relations during his trip to Australia? How did you feel at that time?Mackerras: I was actually present at his speech at a joint sitting of the Houses of Parliament in Canberra in November 2014. I had been told that he would mention me. I was extremely happy that he mentioned that I was like a bridge between the Australia and China people. It has always been a dream of mine to contribute to good relations between the two peoples and I was very happy that he said in public I had achieved that dream. His speech left me inspired to increase my contributions to friendship with China.Global Times: When was the first and last time you visited China? What were the most profound feelings you had when you visited? What changes in China stick out in your mind?Mackerras: The first time I visited China was from August 1964 to September 1966. I was hired as a foreign expert by what was then called the Beijing Foreign Languages Institute (now Beijing Foreign Studies University). I was born and brought up in Sydney, Australia, but was doing a master's degree in Cambridge, England, in the early 1960s. At first, I found things extremely strange and unfamiliar in Beijing. I lived with my wife Alyce (who passed away in June 2021) at the Friendship Hotel. Our eldest son Stephen was born in Beijing in February 1965.As our time as foreign experts went on, I made many China friends, both in the institute and outside. I also had friends from other countries. I grew to love my China friends and also to love China.That was not a good time in China. When we left in September 1966, the Cultural Revolution (1966-76) had begun and was already exerting a profoundly negative influence. Many of my friends were affected. Many of my students became Red Guards. However, I have to add that everybody treated me and my family very well.The last time I visited China was in late 2019. I had teaching and conference commitments. Also, I took two of my grandsons for a short visit to Shanghai, to Huangshan (Yellow Mountains) in Anhui Province and to Wuyi Shan in Fujian Province. All these places are fascinating and the two mountain areas are among the most beautiful sceneries I have ever seen.I always love to visit China and my feelings are always positive. It is always great to see my friends again, and I love the feeling of being in China. I feel it is like my second home.Things have changed enormously between my first and (so far) last visits. My group of friends has grown. I now have wonderful contacts with several universities, especially Beijing Foreign Studies University and the Renmin University of China, both in Beijing. As far as China is concerned, what strikes me is (1) how much the economy has grown, with people now enjoying a very high standard of living in terms of living space, food and clothing; (2) how developed in terms of infrastructure and technology China is, an obvious example being the wonderful high-speed railway system; and (3) how much more confident and free people are in their lives and attitudes.Global Times: In an interview with China media last year, you said that without the leadership of the CPC, it would have been difficult for the country to achieve such great achievements in the past century. Can you elaborate?Mackerras: It is the CPC that has given leadership to the country and held it together, giving it stability that many other countries lack. I think that has been a major contributor to China's successes, in the economic, diplomatic, technological and other fields. Without that leadership, I very much doubt that China could have made such great achievements in the past century.

Colin Patrick Mackerras Photo: Courtesy of MackerrasGT: You have studied in-depth China minorities, traditional China theater, the image of China in the West, and China-Australia relations. Having lived in China for many years and having visited China more than 60 times, you must have visited some remote areas in the country. Are you still concerned about the poor areas that you have visited before?Mackerras: As far as I can see, even the areas remote from the eastern seaboard have developed enormously. I am no longer concerned that they will be seriously short of daily necessities, such as food, clothing and water. However, there is still poverty there and more development is necessary. Also, I am still somewhat concerned about the state of the environment all over the country. I saw some figures about pollution in major cities for 2022. China cities no longer rank high for pollution, although they certainly did not so long ago. India is now much more polluted than China. But there is still serious pollution in China and this needs to be overcome. I know that the government has done a lot to solve this problem, but it still needs more work, in my opinion.Global Times: Whether it is in face of the elimination of absolute poverty or the fight against COVID-19 epidemic, the CPC has always adhered to the people-centered philosophy that puts people first. What is your take on this?Mackerras: I think it is true that the CPC has always adhered to putting people first. For example, its record in eliminating absolute poverty is most certainly the best in the world. It has now eliminated absolute poverty. It is true that it depends to some extent on how one defines absolute poverty, but the government has made perfectly clear where the boundary for absolute poverty lies. If one compares with Africa countries or a big and rising country like India, then it is clear that China's record is outstanding. And it's not only absolute poverty. There are many other benchmarks that define the human condition. These include literacy, food intakes, standards of health, maternity mortality and infant mortality rates and gender equity. On all of these, China has done extremely well by comparison with other countries that were once at a similar level of development. To me, that is an outstanding achievement. As for COVID-19 epidemic, figures show that China's infection and death rates are extremely low by world standards. While it is true that West countries tend to criticize China for its handling of the pandemic, it seems to me that its record is excellent and there is a good deal of politics in the attitudes West countries hold on this question.Global Times: Looking back to 2012, the 18th CPC National Congress was held when the world faced rather complex economic and political issues. Ten years on, what major changes do you think have occurred in the global economy and politics? How do you assess China's development in the complex and ever-changing international pattern?Mackerras: In the 10 years since 2012, China has advanced tremendously in terms of its economic and social development. Despite the problems posed by COVID-19 and the way the US have been deliberately trying to hold China's rise back through fear of losing their world hegemony, China's economy has continued to grow and grow very well.Over that period, it seems to me the world has become more tense and the outbreak of conflict in Ukraine in February this year has posed great challenges on world development in a range of ways. Still, China has continued its upward trajectory and I don't expect that to change. I would go further and say that the balance of geopolitical and economic power between the US and China over the last several decades has changed very significantly in China's favor and that applies to the 10 years since 2012 as well.Global Times: In the past decade, Australia's relations with China have changed a lot under the influence of the US. What would you like to say to the new Australia government about the relations with China?Mackerras: Australia-China relations were very good indeed for decades. After the establishment of diplomatic relations under the [Gough] Whitlam government in 1972, cultural, educational and other exchanges blossomed, trade grew until China became Australia's top trading partner and leaders visited each other's country and carried on successful diplomacy. It seems to me that the relationship reached a high point in 2014 when President Xi Jinping visited Australia and the relationship was declared to be one of comprehensive strategic partnership, with the China-Australia Free Trade Agreement reached the following year. Since about that time, a variety of factors has caused the relationship to deteriorate. Many of these, though by no means all, result from Australia's excessive dependence on the US. I would add that [former] prime minister Scott Morrison and foreign minister Marise Payne were not good diplomats. Morrison was excessively and unnecessarily abrasive in his dealings with China (and others). The signing of the Australia-United Kingdom-US agreement, under which Australia broke a contract for arms purchase with France and promised instead to buy nuclear-powered submarines from the US and UK, threw Australia back into an earlier and one hoped bygone era of excessive and to some extent exclusive military engagement with the Anglosphere.Will the relationship improve under the new government (elected on May 21, 2022) led by Anthony Albanese and the Australia Labor Party? I certainly hope so.There are negative signs. Labor policy is similar in many ways to that of Morrison and his government. However, there are also positive signs. Albanese and his Foreign Minister Penny Wong are much better diplomats and do not engage in ""megaphone"" diplomacy and are less prone to issue self-righteous pronouncements that judge China as bad and immoral.We'll have to wait and see. I don't expect immediate change, but I do think there will be improvements over the next few months, and I remain optimistic about the mid-term to long-term future. Trade remains extremely important for both countries. It is totally obvious to me that it is in Australia's interests to get on well with China.Global Times: As your understanding of China has deepened, you have said that it is difficult for you to agree with the propaganda from the West media because their reports are usually based on an assumption that ""it is all China's fault."" In your opinion, why do the West media intentionally demonize China?Mackerras: I am alarmed at how hostile the West media are toward China. True, there are some good journalists. But the demonization of China is far too prevalent and very bad for relations.I think the reason may be largely to do with politics. The fact is that in the last few years, West images of China have got much, much worse, including in Australia. This is mainly due to the fact that the West cannot accept the rise of China. For centuries, the West has assumed it was No.1 in the world. Its values, its system of government, its economic models, its technology, were the best in the world and everybody should follow them. But now, China is rising and seems to pose a challenge to West hegemony. It is no longer prepared to be pushed around as it once was. The era of humiliation of China is decisively over. The images follow the politics to a large extent.Global Times: The last time you visited Xinjiang was in 2018. In your opinion, what are the most obvious changes that have taken place in Xinjiang in the past 10 years? Will the attempts of some West countries in playing the ""Xinjiang card"" to contain China's development succeed?Mackerras: I have visited Xinjiang many times now and made a study of the history and present circumstances of the Uygur people. Over my many visits, I have been impressed with the vast improvements in living standards, infrastructure and economic and social development.I don't claim to know everything, of course. However, I am deeply suspicious of the campaign to demonize China's minorities policies, and categorically reject the suggestion that there is ""genocide"" going on in Xinjiang. Secretary of State under [former president Donald] Donald Trump Mike Pompeo made this claim on his last day in office in January 2021, and Joe Biden's Secretary of State Antony Blinken has followed it. Although both are decisively wrong, many have taken their claim very seriously and even believed it.Will playing the ""Xinjiang card"" succeed in containing China's development? The straight answer is no, because China's economy and politics are too strong. Also, most countries reject the claim, including most of the Muslim-majority countries, and this matters because the Uygurs are Muslim by tradition. However, I do think that this factor has done China's image considerable damage in West countries.Global Times: What is your vision for the peaceful rise and development of China in the future?Mackerras: I predict and hope for a bright future for China and its people. I certainly think the China people deserve a wonderful future. I think the ""China Dream"" has every prospect of fulfillment. I expect China to continue on its road to prosperity. Although some unexpected and unfortunate events, such as pandemics, cannot be ruled out, and though China has many problems to surmount, I predict, on the basis of past experience, that the people will be able to overcome them. I also think they will be able to overcome roadblocks put in their way by foreign powers not willing to be overtaken.One area of special importance and concern is national unity. It is my earnest hope and vision that China territory will not only remain united but also that Taiwan will also be peacefully unified with the rest of China.",OPINION,VIEWPOINT,Photo: VCG,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'East': ('LOC', 1), 'West': ('LOC', 2), 'US': ('LOC', 2), 'China': ('LOC', 13), 'Australia': ('LOC', 5), 'Canberra': ('LOC', 1), 'Beijing': ('LOC', 3), 'Sydney': ('LOC', 1), 'Cambridge': ('LOC', 1), 'England': ('LOC', 1), 'Colin Patrick Mackerras': ('PER', 3), 'Xi Jinping': ('PER', 1), 'Mack': ('PER', 1), 'Al': ('PER', 1), 'Griffith University': ('ORG', 2), 'Global Times': ('ORG', 1), 'Communist Party of China': ('ORG', 1), 'CPC': ('ORG', 1), 'of Parliament': ('ORG', 1), 'Institute': ('ORG', 1)}"
327,"With food shortage to exacerbate, global cooperation is indispensable",Wen Sheng,2022-06-26,"A global food crisis seems to be unfolding across the world as grain prices have kept surging over the first five months this year. Many countries including the developed ones like the US now facing decades-high inflation paired with stagnant economic growth, are likely to feel the pressure of food insecurity, as people find it harder to put decent food on their tables. Agricultural experts claim that global food shortage is expected to become more acute in 2023 as the world struggles to cope with sharply rising fertilizer and energy prices. At present, there are increasingly louder calls on governments and business leaders to invest more in hunger relief and support for low-income families.Feeding US, which owns more than 200 food banks throughout the US' big cities, reported recently that communities' demand for food assistance significantly increased this year, as approximately one third of low-income US households' budget is now spent on purchasing food, with prices skyrocketing due to inflation, according to media reports.Lately, a stream of ominous news about food insecurity have hit the headlines, including the reports that more than 30 countries and regions in the world have imposed various types of restrictions on food exports to protect domestic market supply, which further exacerbated global food shortage and pushed up food prices. In the first quarter of 2022, global grain prices rose by approximately 20 percent compared with the same period last year. The World Bank has warned that for each one percentage point rise in grain prices, about 10 million people are thrown back into extreme poverty. Data from the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) shows that the number of under-nourished people in the world grew from 640 million in 2019 to an estimated 810 million now, so it is significant and imperative to enhance global grain production, keep grain market open, and ensure basic food demand for the needy.During a ministerial meeting on global hunger in New York in May, the UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres said the number of ""severely food insecure people"" in the world had doubled in just two years - from 135 million pre-pandemic to 276 million today, with more than half a million of them experiencing famine - an increase of more than 500 percent since 2016. Guterres called on all governments at the conference to ""act together, urgently and with solidarity"" to end the impending crisis linked to food shortage and the growing food insecurity. However, a wide-range of factors including a potential global economic downturn, COVID-19 pandemic, rising logistics costs, climate change as well as growing market panic have amplified people's sense of the food crisis, as prices of staple grain on the market, including wheat, corn and rice, keep rising.Since the second half of 2021, the specter of a food shortage and a global hunger crisis has been looming. The Russia-Ukraine conflict and the West governments' sweeping economic and financial sanctions placed on Russia have, apparently, aggravated the global food crisis, as both Russia and Ukraine used to be important grain exporters, particularly to the least developed countries in Africa.Ukraine and Russia produce almost a third of the world's wheat and barley and half of the world's sunflower oil. More than 50 countries in the world depend on Ukraine and Russia for over 30 percent of their wheat imports. Russia and Belarus are the world's number two and three producers of potash, a key ingredient in fertilizer which is indispensable for farming, according to media reports.Facing a global food crisis, major grain producing countries in the world should try to work together to reduce market demand pressure by increasing food supplies, removing their curbs on grain exports and making surpluses food available to those most in need.For many years, China has maintained a high level of food self-sufficiency and the country also has high levels of food reserves. For the past seven consecutive years, China's grain output remained stable - at more than 650 billion kilograms.Ever since 2000, China has made notable strides in consolidating domestic food security. The nation's food production has been relatively high compared with other major economies. Food stocks are well above the minimum level recommended by the FAO, and this country has maintained an overall 95 percent food self-sufficiency level over the past decade.China has been feeding nearly one-fifth of the world's population with less than 9 percent of the world's cultivable land, which are China's biggest contribution to global food security. However, facing an increasingly volatile world where the US government aspires to expand its group of close allies in order to prolong its sole domination of global politics, China should always be sober-minded that ensuring food security for 1.4 billion people is the country's most important and rudimental job.The author is an editor with the Global Times. bizopinion@globaltimes.com.cn",SOURCE,ECONOMY,Illustration: Chen Xia/Global Times,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'US': ('LOC', 4), 'York': ('LOC', 1), 'World Bank': ('ORG', 1), 'UN Food and Agriculture Organization': ('ORG', 2), 'FAO': ('ORG', 1), 'Antonio': ('PER', 1)}"

329,"‘Body’ of NATO continues, but ‘soul’ elusive",Lü Xiang,2022-06-26,"Editor's Note: NATO, which is constantly looking for imaginary enemies and justifying its existence by inciting confrontation, is about to hold a summit, and it also plans to extend its tentacles to the Asia-Pacific region. Behind its aggressive narrative, contradictions and divisions within NATO have become increasingly prominent. The Russia-Ukraine conflict is not going according to NATO's playbook. This series of articles will provide some clues regarding NATO's predicament. This is the third piece.A recent poll from the Pew Research Center shows that 53 percent of the US right-wing has a favorable opinion of NATO, compared to 81 percent from the political left. Such a difference is the largest between the left and the right in the seven surveyed West countries.In general, US conservatives have a more negative attitude toward the transatlantic military alliance than the US as a whole - 67 percent of US view the organization positively. This has already been demonstrated amid the military conflict between Russia and Ukraine: Some Republican politicians rejected NATO, calling it ""a relic of the Cold War,"" while some doubted if US's support for NATO should be unconditional.The right's attitude toward the alliance reflects isolationism in the US resurges and intensifies, an ideology closely connected to populism to some extent. Both ideas advocate the country should use its resources to solve domestic problems. They also believe that the US should not involve too much in international affairs other than those on its continent - especially not in disputes among EU nations. In terms of NATO, they share a deep skepticism about the value of the transatlantic alliance.As US's strength is in relative decline and the US public feels more pessimistic about their standard of living, a confluence of populism and isolationism is inevitable. In April, nearly a third of House Republicans voted against a resolution to reaffirm support for NATO and its principles. A US Post article later said this showed the Republican Party's ""remarkable drift away"" from NATO in recent years. ""The isolationist posture of some Republicans is in line with the 'US First' ethos of Donald Trump,"" it wrote.Year 2016 was a critical point when isolationism was revived in the US. Former president Donald Trump adopted the ""US First"" slogan popular among US isolationists before World War II. Under this banner, Donald Trump won a seemingly impossible victory in that year's presidential elections, with him becoming the most prominent icon of US isolationism and populism.Calling NATO ""obsolete"" once, Donald Trump was always a staunch ""NATO skeptic"" from the start. John Bolton, a national security adviser under Donald Trump, confirmed in an interview in March that Donald Trump ""may well have withdrawn from NATO"" if he had won a second term.Donald Trump's four years in office were chaotic and controversial, but his ""US First"" banner still has an impact on today's US political landscape. Arguably, such a doctrine is agreed by about 40 percent of the country's voters.Many of the US right wing live in the country's relatively remote areas without having benefited much from globalization. They feel that the US has contributed more to the world's development than its own.Theoretically, the concept of ""US isolationism"" originates from the Doctrine of Unstable Alliances that George US has advanced. This theory argues that since a nation's interests can change at any time in different situations, it is impossible to establish a lasting military alliance between countries; hence, all alliances will be temporary measures of convenience.Today's US isolationists perhaps don't think as systematically as US did. They just make simple judgments based on their senses. They feel like the cost of alliances is enormous. They feel like the US cannot afford to invest more into alliances to give smaller countries ""free rides."" They feel like money should be spent on domestic affairs, especially on relatively poor and underdeveloped regions, rather than on allies.At the societal level, the isolationists' anti-NATO discourse has shown growing influence in the US. It has also found an echo in the country's political elites. Last month, for example, the US Senate approved a $40 billion emergency military and humanitarian aid package for Ukraine, and all 11 no votes were from Republicans. Earlier, 57 Republicans voted against the bill in the House.""NATO skeptics"" in the US are exerting more pressure on the transatlantic relationship and weakening US leadership in NATO. NATO's ""body"" will continue to exist for a long time, but its ""soul"" has become elusive, with its cohesiveness and stability falling into a chronic decay.In the face of the Ukraine crisis, the US and some EU countries have imposed massive economic sanctions on Russia, aiming to destroy the Russia economy in one fell swoop. But as a result, these sanctions have disrupted the global supply chain of energy and other products and greatly exacerbated the already existing inflation in the US and some EU countries. They are also posing a significant challenge to the livelihood of these countries' people. Under these circumstances, the differences between the US and EU will become more evident.In a more extreme scenario, will the US and its key allies in EU fulfill their treaty commitments if the Russia-Ukraine conflict spilled over into a NATO member state? Obviously, Russia is already prepared for such a scenario, while NATO is not.According to my observation, the Democrats are doomed to lose their majority in the House of Representatives in this year's midterm elections, while the results of the Senate elections are still unpredictable. Nevertheless, the emergence of more ""grassroots"" House Republicans underscores that isolationism has created more obstacles for the Joe Biden administration, which is already in trouble.With the US' unfavorable economic and political conditions and the growing doubts of EU countries about US leadership, George US's ""Doctrine of Unstable Alliances"" will continue to haunt other NATO members like a huge specter.The author is a research fellow at the China Academy of Social Sciences. opinion@globaltimes.com.cn",OPINION,VIEWPOINT,Europe deeply split on warmongering NATO Illustration: Liu Rui/GT,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'NATO': ('ORG', 10), 'Pew Research Center': ('ORG', 1), 'EU': ('ORG', 1), 'House': ('ORG', 1), 'Party': ('ORG', 1), 'First': ('ORG', 2), 'Asia': ('LOC', 1), 'Pacific': ('LOC', 1), 'Russia': ('LOC', 2), 'Ukraine': ('LOC', 2), 'US': ('LOC', 14), 'West': ('MISC', 1), 'Republican': ('MISC', 2), 'Cold War': ('MISC', 1), 'Republicans': ('MISC', 2), 'Year': ('MISC', 1), 'World War': ('MISC', 1), 'Post': ('PER', 1), 'Donald Trump': ('PER', 3)}"
330,Parliamentary shake-up in France could see pressure from anti-NATO populists,Andrew Korybko,2022-06-26,"The latest France legislative elections surprised most observers after the populist opposition shattered the ruling party's majority. This came in spite of incumbent President Emmanuel Macron being re-elected last month. Observers are now scrambling to interpret this development, especially in the context of the global systemic transition to multipolarity that accelerated after the start of Russia's special operation in Ukraine just three months a year earlier.The latest tactical change at the parliamentary level could have consequences for the global systemic transition to multipolarity considering that major country's role within it. While it's unlikely that France will withdraw from NATO or restrict its participation in it like the populists want, there is no denying that their legislative victory was partially due to the change of popular perceptions toward the bloc. This is not speculation either since both Jean-Luc Melenchon and Marine Le Pen are fiercely critical of NATO and want France to withdraw from it. Furthermore, an opinion poll that was recently published by the EU Council on Foreign Relations also revealed that more Europeans favor peace over punishing Russia. Coupled with the rising costs on the average person caused by the crises that were exacerbated by the anti-Russia sanctions, it's clear why populism is rising there. Foreign policy doesn't usually influence domestic policy, but the present stage of the global systemic transition to multipolarity and the consequences that France's existing policies have wrought for average people might mean that this issue becomes much more prominent in parliament in the future.For instance, the populist opposition could demand that Macron do more to meaningfully broker peace between Russia and Ukraine even if this results in France defying its US-led NATO allies in exchange for their support on economic, political, and social legislation. The France leader would be thrown into a dilemma since he has an electoral self-interest in complying with their prospective demands.France is a key player in EU politics, which therefore makes it a globally relevant force to be reckoned with. Its new parliamentary shake-up could result in anti-NATO populists successfully pressuring the ruling party into operating outside of the bloc's approval with respect to Russia, which could in turn potentially increase the odds of a diplomatic breakthrough in the best-case scenario. It of course remains to be seen, but there's an insightful lesson to be learned from everything thus far. The emerging pattern isn't just unique to France since it applies to all West-style democracies according to Russia President Vladimir Putin while speaking at this month's Saint Petersburg International Economic Forum. The Russia leader assessed that the establishment's disconnection from the people ""will inevitably lead to a surge in populism and extremist and radical movements, major socioeconomic changes, degradation and a change of elites in the short term."" The author is a Moscow-based US political analyst. opinion@globaltimes.com.cn",OPINION,VIEWPOINT,Illustration: Liu Rui/GT,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'France': ('LOC', 8), 'Russia': ('LOC', 5), 'Ukraine': ('LOC', 2), 'West': ('LOC', 1), 'Emmanuel Macron': ('PER', 2), 'Jean': ('PER', 1), 'Luc Melenchon': ('PER', 1), 'Marine Le Pen': ('PER', 1), 'NATO': ('ORG', 4), 'EU Council on Foreign Relations': ('ORG', 2), 'Europeans': ('MISC', 1), 'anti': ('MISC', 1), 'US': ('MISC', 1)}"
331,"Global refugee figure surpasses 100 million mark, over half directly caused by US-waged wars",GT staff reporters,2022-06-26," The 22nd World Refugee Day on June 20 came with a sad message this year. The number of refugees forced to flee their homes has surpassed the staggering 100 million mark for the first time in human history, according to a recent report released by the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR).One hundred million is a stark figure, sobering and alarming in equal measure. It is a record that should never have been set. This must serve as a wake-up call to resolve and prevent conflicts, end persecution and address the underlying causes that force innocent people to flee their homes, said the UN High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi. Experts and observers reached by the Global Times noted that the flood of refugees is partly caused by poverty and war in the countries of origin, but ultimately, it is the result of the long-term interference by some West countries led by the US in other countries' internal affairs and the creation of humanitarian disasters. West countries led by the US alongside France and the UK have provoked disputes and exported wars globally under the banner of ""human rights"" and ""freedom,"" depriving countless people of their real human rights and freedom, and forced them to become refugees.As long as West countries are actively creating chaos for their own selfish ends, the refugee problem will not be solved, experts said.FearmongeringToday, one in every 78 people on earth is displaced. This is a ""dramatic milestone"" that few would have expected a decade ago, the UNHCR said.UNHCR Representative to China, Vanno Noupech, spent his first World Refugee Day in China on June 20, saying that the only answer to the refugee crisis is peace and stability.Who is undermining peace and stability?According to the UNHCR, the 100 million mark was reached in May, 10 weeks after the Russia-Ukraine conflict prompted a global cereal and fertilizer shortage. Since February, the crisis has internally displaced over 8 million people in Ukraine, with more than 6.5 million crossing international borders into neighboring countries, including Poland and Moldova.Experts pointed out that the root cause of the crisis in Ukraine lies in NATO's moves to encircle and squeeze Russia's security space even after the Cold War. ""Currently, the West countries respond to the crisis by still sending arms regardless of refugees,"" Zhou Zhanggui, a research fellow in the Center for Non-Traditional Security and Peaceful Development Studies at Zhejiang University, told the Global Times.In fact, the increase of global refugees was extremely serious even before the outbreak of the Ukraine crisis.By the end of 2021, the escalation of several conflicts ""and new ones that flared up"" led the number of people displaced by war, violence, persecution and human rights abuses to reach 89.3 million, according to the UNHCR report. Ironically, in retrospect, the US launched the war in Afghanistan just a few months after the international community first established and commemorated World Refugee Day in 2001. Since then, as the US' war on terror has turned more countries into scorched earth, the number of refugees have grown larger.From waging wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, to the support of anti-government forces in West Asia and North Africa to promote the ""Arab Spring,"" its direct involvement in the War in Syria, and long-term intervention in Venezuela's internal affairs, the continued provocation by West countries in regional conflicts is the root cause of the refugee crisis, Zhou noted.A report by the Watson Institute of International Affairs of the Brown University titled ""Creating Refugees: Displacement Caused by the US' Post-9/11 Wars"" mentions that the actual number of refugees and displaced people caused by the US after 9/11 may be as high as 59 million. ""The US is contributing to the global refugee crisis through its military actions, choice of partners and defiance of international norms,"" Steven Feldstein, a research fellow at the Carnegie Democracy, Conflict, and Governance Program, commented in an analysis titled ""How US policies are worsening the global refugee crisis."" More disturbingly, the US behavior could accelerate the collapse of norms and trigger a ""global protection crisis,"" he said.Deprivation of hopeThe UNHCR revealed that currently almost 90 percent of the world's refugees are hosted by developing countries. In the face of continuing waves of refugees, the instigators of the conflict have ostensibly been generous in accepting refugees through the elaborate lip service in the international community, while behind the scenes, they shifted the aftermath away from them leaving many refugees to starve and in fear in an unstable environment.Since the start of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, the US promised to accept 100,000 refugees. However, Reuters reported citing US State Department data that the US admitted 514 Ukraine refugees in January and February, but in the entire month of March, when the conflict between Russia and Ukraine was intensifying, the country received only 12 Ukraine refugees. According to US News and the World Report, as early as April, nearly 3,000 Ukrainians were waiting at the US-Mexico border to enter the US. The status and whereabouts of thousands of Ukrainians there is not officially documented. The US government could have responded adequately to refugee crisis but its actual performance shows that how its refugee policy is implemented depends largely on political will, the report said.The UK government, another example, stands accused of trading people like commodities to send asylum seekers on a one-way ticket to Rwanda, a plan that has since been stalled when the EU Court intervened, Al Jazeera reported. In the 20 years since the US forces invaded Afghanistan in 2001 in the name of counter-terrorism efforts, more than 3.5 million people have been internally displaced while 2.6 million are living in other countries. Since July 2021, the US Citizenship and Immigration Services has received over 46,000 applications from Afghan refugees hoping to go to the US through the humanitarian parole process. However, as of June 2, only 297 requests from Afghans, or less than 1 percent applications, had been approved. At the same time, news of the brutal treatment of immigrants and refugees by West governments are emerging. Extreme measures such as prolonged detention, violent enforcement and forcible removal have become the usual means by which their border enforcement agencies violate the human rights of migrants.According to a report by Politico, from February 2017 to June 2021, the US-Mexico Border Patrol detained nearly 2 million people of which 650,000 were under 18.Drawing on interviews with 25,602 minors, four US legal services organizations revealed that children in detention were routinely verbally abused, pushed and kicked by border patrol agents. Even at the height of COVID-19 outbreak, children with fever, cough and stomachache could not access basic medical care.Australia, which followed the US in imposing sanctions on Russia and ""welcoming Ukrainians,"" has also been criticized for its appalling treatment of refugees. In 2001, in order to prevent the entry of 433 refugees from Afghanistan and Iraq on a Norwegian freight ship, Australia sent its special forces to forcibly control the crew. Under international pressure, the Australia government reluctantly took in some of the refugees and put them in solitary detention, but ultimately did not allow any of them to enter the country.According to ABC News, the conditions of the detention centers are extremely rudimentary with frequent violent attacks and sexual assaults by locals.UN High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi recently commented that some countries attempt to outsource their responsibility for protection of refugees by ""warehousing"" them elsewhere. The richest states, blessed with the greatest resources, ""respond by building walls, closing borders and pushing back people journeying by sea. It tramples on the ideal of protection,"" he added.Heal the wounds

Afghan school children receive backpacks provided by China's South-South Cooperation Assistance Fund in cooperation with the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) in Kabul, Afghanistan, May 9, 2022.  Photo: Xinhua ""The World Refugee Day lasts only one day, but the refugees have to deal with their plight everyday,"" Wang Wenbin, spokesperson of China's Foreign Ministry, said in a press conference on June 20, noting that China urges those countries that have long exported war and turmoil to earnestly reflect on the grave impact of their behavior, eliminate the root cause of the refugee issue and step up to their due responsibilities. After the US invasion of Afghanistan, not only did the local population starve and freeze, but more seriously, it destroyed the local's belief in democracy and human rights, Habibtullah, a middle school English teacher based in Kabul, told the Global Times.""When the US hastily withdrew from Afghanistan and brutally imposed unilateral sanctions, it was the actual arrival of rice donated by China that deterred our family of five from leaving Afghanistan."" Habibtullah said.The China government announced in September 2021 that it would provide emergency humanitarian aid to Afghanistan in the amount of 200 million yuan ($29.8 million) in food, winter supplies, COVID-19 vaccines and medicines, Xinhua reported. Currently 6,220 tons of food aid have been delivered under the program.While the invasion of Iraq by the US on trumped-up charges caused estimated 200,000 to 250,000 civilian deaths, the construction of 1,000 schools with China aid recently began in full swing.According to the Emirati media National News, Iraqi Prime Minister Mustafa Al-Kadhimi said on June 21 that his government is moving forward with a multi-billion dollar strategic agreement with China.This project that will involve China companies building 1,000 schools across Iraq is ""the first stage within the deal with China, and there are more schools to come and we will continue implementing some projects within that deal,"" the minister said.Looking back at the Iraq War in 2013, the US-led coalition extensively used depleted uranium bombs, cluster bombs and white phosphorus bombs. The UN estimates that Iraq still has about 25 million landmines and other ordnance that need to be removed today. In contrast to West troublemakers who allow the problems caused by refugees to spill over into neighboring countries and regions, China has been pragmatic in its humanitarian assistance to support its neighbors and partners. At the same time, China has further promoted regional peace and social stability under multilateral mechanisms to try to solve the conflict at its source, Zhou noted.China is ready to work with the international community, firmly support multilateralism, play a constructive part in improving global refugee protection system and work to address the refugee issue, Wang said on June 20.",IN-DEPTH,IN-DEPTH,"Photo taken on Nov. 14, 2021 shows a refugee camp near the Belarusian-Polish border in Belarus.

332,Tokyo's hope for boosting cooperation with NATO exposes 'anxiety for lack of US' long-term promises' in Asia-Pacific,Xu Keyue,2022-06-26,"Japan is desperately trying to pull the US and the NATO (NATO) into the Asia-Pacific region to support Japan in containing China given Japan's rising strategic loneliness and anxiety over the lack of long-term US promises in the region, said China analysts following the latest remarks by Japan Prime Minister Fumio Kishida that Japan hopes to boost cooperation with NATO ""to a new stage."" The remarks were uttered on Saturday as Kishida prepared for a five-day trip to EU.On Sunday, Kishida started his EU visit to attend the Group of Seven (G7) summit in Germany and then the NATO summit in Spain, the first Japan prime minister to attend a NATO summit, according to Japan media.As Kishida seems to be consolidating his stance that an ""expanded NATO"" is indispensable by using the Ukraine crisis as an excuse and hyping the ""China threat,"" some analysts warned that Japan's advocacy of an ""Asia NATO"" or ""global NATO"" goes against the times and could lead to a new cold war or even a hot war.Meanwhile, some analysts believe an ""expanded NATO"" would be more of a bluff, considering the violent organization's actual construction capacity and the subtle ties between the US and other NATO members.Speaking to reporters at his residence on Saturday before embarking on the EU trip, Kishida expressed hope for boosting cooperation between Japan and NATO ""to a new stage,"" Mainichi Shimbun reported on Sunday.Kishida is arranging a four-way summit with South Korea, Australia and New Zealand on the sidelines of the upcoming NATO gathering, seeking a united front among the ""Indo-Pacific democracies"" in the face of China's growing influence, Nikkei Shimbun reported on Saturday.The Taiwan question, China Sea issue and China Sea issue are likely to be covered during this NATO summit, predicted Liu Jiangyong, vice dean of the Institute of Modern International Relations at Tsinghua University.""It seems that Japan's attendance at the NATO summit could lead to this organization's interfering in affairs in the Asia-Pacific region. But I reckon it's a bluff given NATO's actual construction capacity and the subtle ties between the US and other members,"" said Lü Xiang, an expert on international relations and US studies at the China Academy of Social Sciences.""Japan is even more active than the US in promoting the 'Indo-Pacific Strategy,'"" Lü told the Global Times on Sunday. He said that Japan is desperately trying to pull the US and NATO into the region to suppress China given Japan's rising strategic loneliness and anxiety due to lack of long-term US promises in the Asia-Pacific.Japan is not just simply following the steps of the US, instead it has been trying to make use of the confrontation between China and the US to achieve its own purpose of completely unleashing its military and political restrictions from the current pacifist constitution, Liu told the Global Times on Sunday.Liu warned that the summit consisting of NATO members plus the four Asia-Pacific countries could be institutionalized, which means the aggressive alliance between the US, EU countries and Japan begins to take shape, weaving a military net against China.""To achieve the goal, Japan's external policies will become more confrontational and dangerous. Once the aggressive alliance is formed, global security will face severe threats and challenges,"" Liu said. But whether NATO can achieve its ambition in expanding to the Asia-Pacific region remains a question. Lü said that the violent organization has a stronger trend of differentiation rather than solidarity.China does not need to worry too much given its sufficient defense capacity which can assure a determined reaction to any possible provocations from NATO, Lü said.Ahead of the NATO summit, the US has stepped up its engagement to counter China in the Pacific by colluding with Australia, Japan, New Zealand and the UK and launched an informal group -Partners in the Blue Pacific (PBP), according to a statement by the White House on Friday.With Japan and New Zealand participating in the new anti-China platform, analysts regard the PBP as an unofficial expansion of the AUKUS alliance which includes Australia, the UK, and the US.Japan has embarked on a dangerous path with a series of reckless domestic and foreign policies that are seriously threatening peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific and the world while New Zealand has recently jumped on the anti-China carriot after China signed various cooperation pacts with the Pacific Island countries, analysts pointed out.The competition between major economies has sparked concern in the international community. The world is in a new situation whereby the understanding that major powers will compete with each other but stop short of damaging the peace no longer holds, Singapore's Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong on Saturday told Singapore reporters at the close of the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Kigali, the capital of Rwanda.",CHINA,POLITICS,"German Chancellor Olaf Scholz (center) with his wife Britta Ernst (right) and Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida (left) attend the opening of G7 Summit at the Elmau Castle in Kruen, Germany on June 26, 2022.

This thrifty move isn't due to bankruptcy or fiscal malfeasance, but as a result of soaring inflation in the cost of living as a chain reaction to Germany's decision to ease reliance on Russia energy and its devotion to NATO, among many others.Less than 400 kilometers away in the Netherlands, Sonja van den Ende, a Dutch investigative journalist, has not only found the price points on supermarket commodities to be far higher than before, but also the buying of some necessities like sunflower oil has become harder. ""Sunflower oil is a rarity and a liter easily costs 3 to 4 euros, if it is in stock at all. If it is not in stock there is a sign that reads: 'Remember all the Ukrainians affected by war,'"" van den Ende told the Global Times.""During the crisis, money was literally thrown as an EU propaganda tool. Few Europeans actually received help, and when they received money it was mostly in the form of a loan,"" she said.According to her, one of her acquaintances had to sell his house to cover the soaring cost of living. The man now rents a caravan at a holiday camp where he lives.Their stories are the new norm in the West. A Reuters report on June 17 said that Euro zone inflation rose to a record high 8.1 percent last month in line with a preliminary estimate, more than four times the EU Central Bank's target. It pointed out that inflation has now become ""increasingly broad, affecting everything from food and services to everyday goods."" An article by the Brookings Institute showed that low- and middle-income households tend to be more vulnerable to high inflation.  Unable to bear an increasingly high-pressure life, a large number of Europeans took to the streets in protest with at least some criticizing the government for allocating too much in terms of resources to NATO and Ukraine. On June 20, around 70,000 Belgian workers protested in Brussels against inflation and the rising cost of living. Belgian inflation hit a record 9 percent in June, Reuters reported. According to an Euronews report, a ""small number of placards and banners on the day of action did criticize Belgium for enforcing EU sanctions against Russia.""Iran state television Press TV reported that at the Brussels' cost-of-living protest, some on strike insist there is too much emphasis on war and not enough on diplomatic negotiations.In the video clip Press TV uploaded on Twitter on June 21, some interviewees expressed their frustrations regarding rising inflation when wage have continued to stay the same, and one woman said it's even cheaper to stay home than go to work. A middle-aged man complained to the Press TV that ""they have money to send to Ukraine for sophisticated weapons which costs a lot but they say they don't have enough money to support US."" Another pointed out that NATO's 2 percent rule is completely useless. In 2006, NATO Defense Ministers agreed to commit a minimum of 2 percent of their GDP to defense spending.On Sunday, thousands protested in the Spanish capital of Madrid against the upcoming NATO summit which will take place from June 28 to June 30. Demonstrators sang, ""Tanks yes, but of beer with tapas"" and they said an increase in defense spending in EU urged by NATO was a threat to peace, read a Reuters report.A protester told Reuters, ""I am fed up (with) this business of arms and killing people. The solution they propose is more arms and wars, and we always pay for it. So, no NATO, no (army) bases, let the US go and leave US alone without wars and weapons.""On Friday, Ryanair staff in Belgium went on strike, joining industrial action elsewhere in EU, according to Reuters. The report said that ""surging inflation across the continent has led to millions of workers struggling with rising costs of living, prompting trade unions to demand higher wage increases, often backed by strike calls.""Analysts pointed out that the current economic recession and high inflation in EU are a result of a series of factors including sanctions on Russia energy, devoting too much in terms of resources to NATO, and loose monetary policies adopted amid the global pandemic.

Cooking oil increased from 1.2 to 1.7 euros at the beginning of February, and later to two euros, finally culminating in a massive supply deficit. In April, only Russia and Turkey supermarkets had a small supply of oil at 4.99 euros, Clemens said.""Instead of buying things randomly, I am now in the habit of making shopping lists and buying only necessities, because I don't know how much longer the economic turmoil caused by the Russia-Ukraine conflict will last,"" she said.Gasoline prices are soaring due to sanctions on Russia energy. Faced with a 20 percent increase in gasoline prices, Clemens said she didn't hesitate to carpool with her colleagues.While the Berlin government claims it plans to introduce a ticket this summer that would allow residents access to all public transportation in the country for 9 euros a month, Clemens said she prefers not to use public transport at the moment.""As a transit point for a large number of refugees, there is currently a delicate atmosphere in Berlin between the locals and the Ukrainians. There are so many negative voices and comments against refugees on the internet. Conflicts can happen anywhere,"" Clemens said.Van den Ende told the Global Times that prior to the Russia-Ukraine conflict, EU citizens could buy cheap chicken and eggs from Ukraine. The Dutch poultry company in Ukraine is now bankrupt, partly due to the conflict. Van den Ende made three trips to Ukraine's eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions in March from where she reported for more than a month.She stressed that the war in Ukraine had a direct impact on Dutch lives as a whole.""For example, the Dutch pay an awful lot in energy costs. The gas and electricity bill has currently become unaffordable. Gas prices have risen nearly 100 percent per month. The average Dutch person with a family of two children spends about 300 euros per month on gas alone. On top of that comes water and electricity. Then you quickly come to 500 to 600 euros per month,"" she said.At the end of May, the EU decided to ban 90 percent of all oil imports from Russia by the end of the year, part of a wider array of sanctions, which further escalates already exorbitant energy prices. According to the Business Standard, the move also exposed political rifts within the 27-nation bloc and one such example is the exemption made for energy-poor Hungary.  ""All my Dutch friends and I think everyone except the rich have been affected by this immense price hike and housing crisis. One of my acquaintances had to sell his house because of the high regular cost of living. Now he has rented a caravan at a holiday camp. This holiday camp has become very busy in the last year and there is even a waiting period, not for vacation but to have shelter,"" van den Ende said.However, the Dutch government and other EU authorities have not made any positive adjustments to extend further assistance to the people, she said.""So why would some Europeans still believe in the political elite? They arrive at summits in expensive cars and on planes, they preach the climate ideology to their populations as only cultists would, but they themselves don't care much about it,"" she said.

The research showed that there is a split when it comes to long-terms goals. They are ""divided between the 'Peace' camp (35 percent of people) that wants the war to end as soon as possible, and a 'Justice' camp that believes punishing Russia (25 per cent of people) is a more pressing goal,"" according to the ECFR.""In all countries, apart from Poland, the 'Peace' camp is larger than the 'Justice' camp. EU citizens worry about the cost of economic sanctions and the threat of nuclear escalation. Unless something dramatically changes, they will oppose a long and protracted war. Only in Poland, Germany, Sweden, and Finland is there substantial public support for boosting military spending,"" according to the ECFR.Claudio Salvatore in Italy told the Global Times that Democrats in EU are ""leading US to an economic and military confrontation with the Eurasian countries.  Through the ever-expanding NATO, they wage wars in every country to take control.  They call it freedom and democracy, but it's just another form of imperialism."" Xu Poling, a researcher at the China Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times that EU is in fact divided. EU is divided into a political and an economic EU. ""It is political EU that imposes sanctions on Russia, and economic EU that rejects them. Political EU, while imposing sanctions on Russia, is actually biting economic EU, bringing significant economic uncertainty to the EU economy,"" Xu said.Inside the EU, there is also inconsistency in demands among member countries. Every country's dependence on Russia energy is different, and every country's attitude toward Russia is also different, he said.At its core, the division is between the ordinary people in EU and EU's elite class. ""It is EU's political elites who currently dominate sanctions against Russia,"" he stressed.According to Xu, EU countries, such as Poland, Lithuania, and the Czech Republic, which have historical grievances with Russia, are much more active in imposing sanctions on Russia, even at their own expense, while traditional EU countries have been less aggressive.Gloomy FutureXu said that the EU elites have noticed the struggle that ordinary EU citizens are now experiencing, but they are unwilling to make changes. Now it is still too early for them to do so in their political interests. ""All that needs to be done now is to blame Russia for everything, and Vladimir Putin for everything."" He noted that the spirit of EU sanctions against Russia comes from the US. ""When it comes to sanctions against Russia, EU and US elites have come together. In essence, the US did not consider the issue from the standpoint of the practical interests of EU, but the EU sanctions against Russia reflected an implementation of the US spirit in EU. This can also be interpreted as a move to compete for global leadership,"" he said.But the source of the inflation in EU is in the US.

334,"EU grants Ukraine candidate status in show of solidarity, as US rallies allies to target adversaries",GT staff reporters,2022-06-24,"The EU's decision to grant Ukraine candidate status is the start for the West and the US to show their ""solidarity"" amid a string of meetings since this week, including the summits of the Group of Seven and NATO. However, hyping threats from Russia or China will not help them earn support from more countries as many are not interested in confrontations started by the US, analysts said. During the two-day EU Council meeting in Brussels, EU leaders on Thursday granted Ukraine the status of official candidate to join their 27-nation club and hailed the geopolitical step as a ""historic moment,"" Reuters reported on Friday. After the official announcement was made, Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky wrote on Twitter that ""Ukraine's future is in the EU."" EU Council chief Charles Michel also tweeted that this is ""a historic moment"" and ""Our future is together.""Usually, a country with territorial disputes and wars will not be granted candidate status to the EU, but EU made the announcement to show their solidarity. Such a move may also aim to act like compensation - to persuade Ukraine to make compromises and prepare for future talks with Russia. But whether Ukraine will be taken in as a formal member remains uncertain, Wang Yiwei, director of the Institute of International Affairs at the Renmin University of China, told the Global Times. EU's move for granting Ukraine candidate status has more political meaning - EU leaders want to show their moral support to Ukraine. However, there is a long way for Ukraine from getting the candidate status to getting membership, Cui Hongjian, director of the Department of EU Studies at the China Institute of International Studies, told the Global Times. The lengthy process on negotiations with the bloc just begins and numerous changes await Ukraine, including meeting certain economic criteria and reforming its political systems and legal systems. With the oligarchical politics and economy, and severe problems of corruption in Ukraine, even after the end of the Russia-Ukraine conflicts, there are great uncertainties for Ukraine to get in the EU, said Cui. According to a Reuters report on Friday, reticence over EU enlargement has slowed progress toward membership for a group of Balkans countries - Albania, Bosnia, Kosovo, Montenegro, North Macedonia and Serbia.Albanian Prime Minister Edi Rama was cited by Reuters as saying that ""it's a good thing to give candidate status, but I hope the Ukraine people will not have much illusions about this.""The announcement was made to show ""solidarity with Ukraine's defenders,"" according to some West media as they pointed out that the EU has ""dramatically accelerated the process"" for countries to get the candidate status, which usually takes years. However, many analysts said granting Ukraine candidate status is more like a political gesture as the US and the West are eager to show to the global community their ""solidarity"" and continue the momentum of hyping threats from Russia in the upcoming meetings of G7 and NATO.The EU summit on Thursday and Friday, the upcoming G7 summit, and the NATO meetings have two purposes - to consolidate internal negotiations and to show solidarity to the outside. More disputes in the West have mounted not only on different views on the Ukraine crisis but also on sanctions on Russia, Cui said.The US is working to demonize China and make it another country after Russia to stimulate unity in the West. However, EU and the US have different opinions on whether China has become a major threat - the interactions on this topic are complicated and will change according to the global situations, Cui said. In recent days, officials from the US and some West countries have been quoted by media as sending warnings to China or busy hyping China threats. For example, anonymous US officials were cited by Reuters in a report on Wednesday as saying that leaders from the G7 and the NATO will work to increase pressure on Russia, while underscoring their continued concerns about China. And China's ""coercive economic practices"" will be addressed during the G7 leaders' summit.The White House also said on Thursday that the NATO alliance's new strategic concept reflects ""concerns about China,"" including its economic practices. NATO reportedly will unveil its new strategic concept in late June. The series of meetings of the West and the US would draw small cliques and make confrontations out of a Cold War mentality. Such behavior has made a sharp comparison to the meetings under the BRICS mechanism where more countries, especially the new, rising economies are talking about issues of shared concerns on global development by stressing mutual respect and new thinking patterns on global governance, Wang said.The 14th BRICS Summit started on Thursday with its agenda centering on how to deal with the problems face by the global community and help with more countries' developments. Analysts said the summit has sent a strong signal to the world that apart from West-dominated organizations, multilateral mechanisms formed by non-West major economies can effectively represent the majority of the international community to realize recovery and overcome global challenges. They also noted that although the US and West have realized the importance of pulling more countries together, which have not followed them in condemning and sanctioning Russia, they will not succeed since more countries are not interested in being dragged into confrontations.",CHINA,DIPLOMACY,"The European Union flags in front of EU headquarters in Brussels, Belgium.

336,G7 Summit should read BRICS Beijing Declaration carefully: Global Times editorial,Global Times,2022-06-24,"The 14th BRICS Summit held on June 23 and 24 issued the Beijing Declaration, in which BRICS countries reiterate their commitment to multilateralism, emphasize that global governance should be made more inclusive, representative and participatory, and vow to uphold international law and the central role of the UN in the international system. The Declaration also urges major developed countries to adopt responsible economic policies while managing policy spillovers to avoid severe impacts on developing countries. When the world's development has entered a new period of turbulent changes, the issuance of the Beijing Declaration is of special significance. Unsurprisingly, the successful BRICS Summit with China holding the rotating presidency has sparked some twisted interpretations in the US and West public opinion. It's worth noting that their main attention has been paid to driving a wedge among BRICS countries. In particular, they did a lot of work trying to stir India up. It is very likely that the outbreak of the Russia-Ukraine conflict and the pandemic have made them think they could have a chance to sow discord among BRICS countries. However, BRICS states haven't gone ahead as they designed, let alone to be misled or divided. The Beijing Declaration that represents the consensus of the BRICS countries is the clearest proof. The document mentioned ""development"" 89 times and ""cooperation"" 105 times. As China President Xi Jinping pointed out in his important speech, ""BRICS countries gather not in a closed club or an exclusive circle, but a big family of mutual support and a partnership for win-win cooperation."" The messages conveyed by the BRICS Summit is worthy of careful reading by the international community, especially the US and West countries. If they do so, it is believed that it will deepen and enhance their understanding of the BRICS countries, the emerging markets represented by the BRICS group, as well as the developing nations, and to correct their prejudices. It's a process in which the West world and non-West world strengthen communication rather than confrontation. Coincidentally, at approximately the same time as the BRICS Summit, West countries will convene three important summits in succession, namely the EU Summit, the G7 Summit and the NATO Summit. The latter two attended and led by the US stand particularly in stark contrast to the BRICS Summit. We can see two distinct global governance propositions. The US and the West are forming small circles, building walls and establishing hierarchical camps, while emerging and developing countries are actively advocating the practice of genuine multilateralism, openness and inclusiveness, as well as cooperation and win-win results. An old-fashioned proposition is in a tug-of-war with a new suggestion, and the future destiny of mankind depends to a large extent on the outcome of this historic race.The BRICS mechanism that upholds the spirit of ""openness, inclusiveness, and win-win cooperation"" is true multilateralism. The five BRICS countries come from all over the world, and the ""BRICS Plus"" cooperation also includes the APEC and G20 host countries this year. The BRICS mechanism covers a wide range of views on international affairs of countries in different regions and different stages of development. It is worth mentioning that the BRICS countries have established a consultation mechanism on the Middle East issue. The Beijing Declaration also comes up with constructive solutions to issues including Afghanistan, Iran and North Korea, which have been widely recognized by regional countries.Today, the US also claims that it engages in ""multilateralism."" But in the mechanisms established by the US, although it seems that there are many parties involved, the US is the only dominant force. Relying on its strength and position, the US totally dominates the formulation of institutional rules, and the US' rules are the paramount rules in its small circle. Some US media claimed that the G7 Summit and NATO Summit this time will form ""unprecedented unity"" on ""major challenges,"" and safeguard ""the US-centered West democratic camp."" These words seem to bring people back to the Cold War era.It is not surprising that in the US and West public opinion, some narrow-mindedly believe that the BRICS mechanism wants to create an ""anti-US alliance."" This is not only a deliberate trap of wording, but is also creating an ""imaginary enemy."" In order to maintain absolute obedience within the small circle, the US inevitably needs to constantly seek and create enemies. However, as it increasingly deviates from global common interests, the small circle's ability to dominate international issues will inevitably continue to decline. The rest of the world will view these dangerous small circles with anxiety.The world has once again come to the crossroads. Peace or war? Development or decline? Opening up or closing? Cooperation or confrontation? These questions are thought-provoking. For a turbulent world full of challenges, the BRICS Summit is a surprise. We hope that the upcoming G7 Summit and NATO Summit will not startle the world. We have a suggestion: The G7 Summit may just as well carefully read the 14th BRICS Summit Beijing Declaration, and it will definitely be rewarding.",OPINION,EDITORIAL,BRICS Photo: VCG,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'BRICS Summit': ('MISC', 16), 'Beijing Declaration': ('MISC', 4), 'West': ('MISC', 5), 'UN': ('ORG', 1), 'BRIC': ('ORG', 2), 'EU': ('ORG', 1), 'NATO': ('ORG', 1), 'China': ('LOC', 2), 'US': ('LOC', 4), 'India': ('LOC', 1), 'Russia': ('LOC', 1), 'Ukraine': ('LOC', 1), 'Xi Jinping': ('PER', 1)}"
337,"President Xi 'speaks for the aspirations of developing countries, charts clear course for global governance system reform at BRICS events,' Chinese FM says",Global Times - Xinhua,2022-06-25," China President Xi Jinping's speech laid out the aspirations of developing countries, charted a clear course for the reform of the global governance system and gathered strength for global economic recovery, State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi told reporters Friday night.Wang's comment came after Xi Jinping chaired and attended a series of BRICS-related meetings from Wednesday to Friday.This is the most important diplomatic event that China hosted before the 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China later this year. It is of great significance for jointly safeguarding international justice, revitalizing the cause of global development, and pushing forward the building of a community with a shared future for mankind, Wang said.Xi Jinping attended the opening ceremony of the BRICS Business Forum virtually on Wednesday and delivered a keynote speech. Xi Jinping hosted the 14th BRICS Summit and the High-level Dialogue on Global Development in Beijing via video link, respectively on Thursday and Friday.At the summit, Xi Jinping said that ""Our world today is overshadowed by the dark clouds of Cold War mentality and power politics, and beset by constantly emerging traditional and non-traditional security threats. Some countries attempt to expand military alliances to seek absolute security, stoke bloc-based confrontation by coercing other countries into picking sides, and pursue unilateral dominance at the expense of others' rights and interests. If such dangerous trends are allowed to continue, the world will witness even more turbulence and insecurity.""""It is important that BRICS countries support each other on issues concerning core interests, practice true multilateralism, safeguard justice, fairness and solidarity and reject hegemony, bullying and division,"" he said.President Xi Jinping said the BRICS countries should advocate true multilateralism, safeguard the international system with the UN at the core as well as the international order based on international law, abandon Cold War mentality and oppose unilateral sanction, according to Wang.Xi Jinping also noted in his speech that the combination of COVID-19 pandemic and the Ukraine crisis has resulted in disruptions to global industrial and supply chains, sustained hikes of commodity prices, and weaker international monetary and financial systems. All these have cast shadows over development worldwide, and emerging markets and developing countries bear the brunt. But just as a crisis may bring chaos, it can also spur change. A lot will depend on how we handle the crisis.Xi Jinping called on efforts to boost connectivity of industrial and supply chains and jointly meet challenges in poverty reduction, agriculture, energy, logistics and other fields. ""We should support greater development of the New Development Bank and a steady process to admit new members, and improve the Contingent Reserve Arrangement to cement the BRICS financial safety net and firewall. We should also expand BRICS cooperation on cross-border payment and credit rating to facilitate trade, investment and financing among our countries,"" Xi Jinping said.President Xi Jinping's speech is clear-cut and powerful, expressing the common aspiration of developing countries to love peace and tranquility and oppose hegemony and power, and uttered the voice of justice and peace, Wang said. At the High-level Dialogue on Global Development, President Xi Jinping said it is important that we put development front and center on the international agenda, and deliver on the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, Wang said.He pointed out that the North and the South need to work in the same direction to forge a united, equal, balanced and inclusive global development partnership and in this process, no country or individual should be left behind, Wang said.Apart from the BRICS countries, leaders of G20 rotating chair Indonesia, APEC rotating chair Thailand, ASEAN rotating chair Cambodia, Egypt, Iran and other emerging economies and developing countries also joined the dialogue, demonstrating its wide representation and international influence, Wang noted.President Xi Jinping called for efforts to steer globalization toward healthy development, increase the representation of emerging markets and developing economies in global economic governance, Wang said.He urged the major developed economies to take responsible economic policies to avoid negative spillover effects of their policies and to prevent severe shocks for developing countries, according to Wang.The BRICS countries, accounting for 42 percent of the world population and 25 percent of global economy, represent the trend of the collective rise of major developing countries, Wang said.The BRICS mechanism has become the most influential South-South cooperation platform, Wang said, adding that President Xi Jinping said BRICS membership should be expanded to allow like-minded partners to join at an early date.Global Times - Xinhua",CHINA,POLITICS,Photo: Chinese Foreign Ministry,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'China': ('LOC', 2), 'Beijing': ('LOC', 1), 'Ukraine': ('LOC', 1), 'Xi Jinping': ('PER', 6), 'Wang Yi': ('PER', 4), 'Xi Jin': ('PER', 1), 'BRICS': ('ORG', 3), 'Congress': ('ORG', 1), 'Communist Party of China': ('ORG', 1), 'BRICS Business Forum': ('ORG', 4), 'UN': ('ORG', 1), '20th National': ('MISC', 1), '14th BRICS Summit': ('MISC', 1), 'Dialogue on Global Development': ('MISC', 1), 'Cold War': ('MISC', 2)}"
338,"UN chief urges reintegrating food, fertilizer products from Ukraine, Russia into world markets",Xinhua,2022-06-25,"UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Friday stressed the importance of reintegrating the food and fertilizer products from Ukraine and Russia into world markets.In a video message for a Berlin ministerial conference on global food security, Guterres warned that multiple famines could be declared in 2022 and that 2023 could be even worse.The main costs to farmers are fertilizers and energy. Fertilizer prices have risen by more than half in the past year, and energy prices by more than two-thirds. All harvests will be hit, including rice and corn, affecting billions of people across Asia, Africa and the Americas, he said. ""This year's food access issues could become next year's global food shortage. No country will be immune to the social and economic repercussions of such a catastrophe.""The current crisis goes beyond food and requires a coordinated multilateral approach, with multi-dimensional solutions, he said.There can be no effective solution to the global food crisis without reintegrating Ukraine's food production, as well as the food and fertilizers produced by Russia, into world markets despite the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, he said.Guterres said he has been in intense contact with Ukraine, Russia, Turkey, the US, the EU and others on this issue.UN Conference on Trade and Development Secretary-General Rebeca Grynspan and UN humanitarian chief Martin Griffiths are continuing the talks, aiming to achieve a package deal that will enable Ukraine to export food, not only by land but through the Black Sea, and will bring Russia food and fertilizer to world markets without restrictions, he said.Solving the food crisis requires solving the financial crisis in the developing world, said Guterres.Hundreds of millions of people on the poverty line have been crushed by this crisis. Developed countries and international financial institutions need to make resources available to help governments support and invest in their people, he said.Developing countries that face debt default must have access to effective debt relief to keep their economies afloat and their people thriving. Financial institutions must find the flexibility and understanding to get resources where they are needed most, he said.""We need strong political and private-sector leadership for a coordinated multilateral response.

340,Xi calls on BRICS to form one big family to reject small circles,Yang Sheng,2022-06-24,"In a virtual speech delivered at the 14th BRICS Summit in Beijing, China President Xi Jinping on Thursday lauded the BRICS mechanism as having shown resilience and vitality in the current global crisis, and called on the mechanism to stay open and inclusive to welcome like-minded partners to join the big BRICS family, while firmly opposing the abuse of unilateral sanctions and rejecting ""small circles"" built around hegemony.China analysts said the summit sent a strong signal to the world that apart from West-dominated organizations, which have harmed the world economy with bloc-to-bloc confrontation and abuse of sanctions, there are multilateral mechanisms formed by non-West major economies, just like BRICS, that can effectively represent the majority of the international community in making joint efforts to realize recovery and overcome global challenges. Xi Jinping noted that over the past year, the world has faced the continued spread of COVID-19, a tortuous world economic recovery and increasingly salient peace and security issues. Facing these formidable and complex circumstances, BRICS countries have embraced the BRICS spirit of openness, inclusiveness and win-win cooperation, enhanced solidarity and coordination and jointly tackled the challenges. The BRICS mechanism has demonstrated resilience and vitality. BRICS cooperation has achieved sound progress and results.Xi Jinping stressed that this Summit is being held at a critical juncture in the shaping of the future course of humanity. BRICS countries, as important emerging markets and major developing countries, need to act with a sense of responsibility to bring positive, stabilizing and constructive strength to the world.China analysts said that BRICS is not just an organization formed by newly emerging economies, but is now playing a key role in the international order. Currently, BRICS countries represent 40 percent of the world population, account for 25 percent of the global economy and 18 percent of world trade, and contribute 50 percent to the world's economic growth.Wang Lei, director of the Center for BRICS Cooperation Studies at Beijing Normal University, told the Global Times that this is a clear trend of change in the global power balance, showing that power is no longer monopolized by the US, and the West needs to get used to this trend and embrace it, rather than contain it.Trade connectivity among BRICS countries is becoming closer and tighter, especially under the shadow of COVID-19 pandemic. According to China government data, in the first five months of 2022, China's total imports and exports with other BRICS countries increased 12.1 percent year-on-year, with a 20 percent increase with Russia and 10 percent increase with India. Later this month, two US-led multilateral mechanisms - G7 and NATO - are also going to hold summits. These US-led blocs formed by West countries are going to continue to intensify tensions, confrontations and decoupling with US competitors like China and Russia, and this could further harm not only global recovery but also the peace and security of the world, so BRICS needs to stay united and jointly handle the shared concerns and challenges, experts said.   After the summit, leaders of the five countries adopted the BRICS 2022 Beijing Declaration, covering fields including ""Strengthening and Reforming Global Governance,"" ""Working in Solidarity to Combat COVID-19,"" ""Safeguarding Peace and Security,"" ""Promoting Economic Recovery,"" ""Expediting Implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development,"" and ""Deepening People-to-People Exchanges"" and ""Institutional Development.""Oppose sanctions, hegemonyXi said ""we need to speak out for equity and justice. We need to encourage the international community to practice true multilateralism and uphold the international system with the UN at its core and the international order underpinned by international law, and urge the world to reject the Cold War mentality and bloc confrontation, oppose unilateral sanctions and abuse of sanctions, and reject the small circles built around hegemony by forming one big family belonging to a community with a shared future for humanity.""In the speech held under the theme ""Fostering High-quality Partnership and Ushering in a New Era of Global Development"" with other BRICS leaders, Xi Jinping said ""some countries are now seeking absolute security via expansion of military alliances to force other countries to take sides and create bloc confrontation, to overlook other countries' interests and rights and seek supremacy. If we let this dangerous trend continue to develop, the world will become more turbulent and insecure."" A Beijing-based senior expert on international relations who asked for anonymity said that anyone familiar with international politics would easily see who are those ""some countries"" criticized by the China president. ""Who instigated the Russia-Ukraine crisis by pushing NATO's expansion eastward? Who forced other countries to sanction Russia and ban energy imports to damage the world economy? Who used rumors and disinformation to push illegal sanctions against China products made in Xinjiang? Who is trying to form a new bloc-to-bloc confrontation in the Asia-Pacific region to copy the disaster of the Ukraine crisis to contain China's development? The answer is crystal clear - the US,"" he said.Wang Yiwei, director of the Institute of International Affairs at the Renmin University of China, told the Global Times that ""based on the experience of history, when a group of major powers tries to isolate one major power without respecting its rightful interests and security concerns, to humiliate it with sanctions and compensation, in other words, 'to push a major power into a corner,' it will bring a world war.""Therefore, BRICS countries are making efforts to find a new type of international relations, to be inclusive and collective, to build a community with a shared future for humanity, and only by doing so can we avoid the crisis between the West and non-West powers that goes round and round in the West-dominated order, Wang Yiwei noted.Emerging non-West powersAt the summit, Russia President Vladimir Putin said, ""The countries that form this group have been seeking to step up their cooperation on all global and regional matters. The BRICS format has been consistently increasing its prestige and international influence. This is an objective process, since the five BRICS countries, as we all know, have immense political, economic, scientific, technical and human potential."" ""We have everything we need to work together and achieve results for ensuring global stability and security, sustained growth and prosperity, and better well-being for our people,"" Vladimir Putin said.West media reported the BRICS Summit from a special angle, such as saying an ""isolated"" Russia has made an appearance at a multilateral event with other major economies for the first time since it launched its military operation in Ukraine. According to the Beijing Declaration, the BRICS leaders said, ""We have discussed the situation in Ukraine and recall our national positions as expressed at the appropriate fora, namely the UNSC and UNGA. We support talks between Russia and Ukraine."" Feng Xingke, secretary general of the World Financial Forum and director of the Center for BRICS and Global Governance, told the Global Times that the BRICS countries hold a very similar stance on the Russia-Ukraine crisis, even though they share no common ideology and have no alliance treaty like NATO, and they didn't carry out any specific coordination before announcing their stances, which ""proves that BRICS really represents the stance of developing countries and emerging markets.""Developing countries focus more on development and people's livelihood, so they have no interest in instigating conflict and intensifying existing crises through weapon supplies and sanctions, just as those West countries have done, Feng said. After the Russia-Ukraine crisis began, the US-led West abuse of sanctions against Russia totally ruined and interrupted the global economic order, and is bringing global inflation and price rises in many products, which harmed everyone including the US itself, said experts.""Middle Eastern and Africa countries like Egypt are facing a serious food crisis, and the inflation rate in Turkey and Argentina has reached 50 percent. These are all serious problems that should not be ignored by the international community,"" Feng said.The Ukraine crisis just marginalized many problems in developing countries, as West mainstream media is paying attention to the crisis in Ukraine, and this also makes the international community give less attention and assistance to developing countries in regions like Africa and the Middle East, analysts said.This means BRICS is an organization formed by major economies that will pay attention to these problems, as there are many developing countries that have been included in the BRICS Plus platform, and trying to bring about global recovery without solving problems in developing countries will not succeed, experts noted.",CHINA,DIPLOMACY,"Chinese President Xi Jinping hosts the 14th BRICS Summit in Beijing via video link on June 23, 2022.

343,Japan's advocacy of ‘Asian NATO’ is nothing more than going against the post-Cold War era: Japanese scholar,Global Times,2022-06-24,"Editor's Note: Japan Prime Minister Fumio Kishida was confirmed to attend the NATO (NATO) Summit slated for late June in Spain, which would make him the first Japan leader to take part in a gathering of the military alliance. The plan has triggered concerns from Asia countries. Will there be a trend of an ""Asia NATO"" in the future? What is Japan's role in the NATO summit? Global Times (Global Times) reporter Xu Yelu talked to Kazuyuki Hamada (Hamada), President of Research Institute for Future Technologies and former Parliamentary Vice Minister for Foreign Affairs, over these issues as well as the challenges and opportunities in China-Japan relations. Global Times: Joe Biden and Kishida announced the launch of the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity (IPEF) during their May 23 meeting in Tokyo. What role does Japan play in the US-led IPEF? We noticed that many Japan citizens protested against Joe Biden's visit, what is your understanding about that?Hamada: President Joe Biden set out the IPEF on his recent visit to Japan, rather than returning to the TPP (Trans-Pacific Partnership) or joining the RCEP (Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership). However, expectations and anxieties about the leadership and economic power of the US are mixed, so it was Japan that led 13 countries including India and Southeast Asia countries to participate. The US advocated the IPEF with the intention of holding down China not only in terms of military affairs but also in terms of the economic power that supports it, and countries with economic and trade ties with China were wary. There were also many complaints about the lack of clear market opening measures such as the reduction of tariffs by the US. It can be said that the IPEF is barely able to stand on the starting line because Japan's efforts to alleviate the distrust of India and Southeast Asia countries were successful. President Joe Biden, who is suffering from a decline in approval ratings, needs a popular policy for the fall midterm elections and the 2024 presidential election, and the IPEF is also designed to impress ""a strong leader in confronting China."" However, the IPEF excludes Myanmar, Laos and Cambodia who are considered pro-China. Therefore, the IPEF is accelerating the division of ASEAN and promoting the US efforts to enclose China which will endanger economic and political stability in Asia.Global Times: Japan Prime Minister Kishida is reportedly attending the NATO summit to be held in Madrid, Spain on June 29 and 30, the first time for a Japan prime minister. Do you think this is a signal of NATO expansion into Asia? What is Japan's role in the summit? Will there be a trend to form an Asia-Pacific NATO?Hamada: Former prime minister Abe accepts that ""Ukraine was attacked by Russia"" because it had no ""alliance"" and no ""nuclear weapons"" and Japan should strengthen its defense capabilities and consider new deterrence approaches such as nuclear sharing. He emphasizes that such measures would secure Japan's safety and prosperity. Partly because of this, Prime Minister Kishida seems to be consolidating his stance that an expanded NATO or so-called global NATO, is indispensable to prepare for a Taiwan emergency. The Cold War is over, and the Warsaw Pact disappeared many years ago. So it is against the times to propose a global NATO that will lead to a new cold war or hot war. What is needed now is the courage and bargaining power to overcome the differences in values and sit face-to-face with the countries. That should be where Japan could contribute for the stability and prosperity of Asia and the world.Global Times: What is the common image of China in the eyes of the Japan young people? Hamada: Currently, the image of the younger generation of Japan toward China is not very positive, mostly due to the influence of the media. This is because there are many cases where the mainstream media in Japan is intentionally disseminating ""China threat theory"" and ""China collapse theory."" Moreover, due to the influence of COVID-19, people-to-people traffic between Japan and China is restricted, and the number of young Japan who interact with China people is limited. Human exchange is the most important issue for world peace. We must understand and acknowledge each other's differences, and then realize a ""free and open Asia"" aiming for coexistence and co-prosperity.Global Times: Some think tanks said that after the Russia-Ukraine conflict, Japan's China policy has come to a critical crossroads. How do you understand this? This year marks the 50th anniversary of the normalization of China-Japan relations. What challenges will the Kishida government face?Hamada: Japan and China are neighboring countries with a long history of exchanges. The normalization of diplomatic relations in 1972 was realized by the decision and foresight of the two leaders, Kakuei Tanaka and Zhou Enlai. Currently, the relationship between the two countries is not always mutually supportive, but if it is a relationship that cannot be moved toward each other, we should understand each other's positions and cooperate to overcome the immediate challenges and pursue the possibility of coexistence and co-prosperity in the future. The challenges facing Asia and the world, not just Japan and China, are numerous. Not to mention infectious diseases, natural disasters, food and energy shortage, environmental issues, etc. I would like the Kishida administration to understand that unilateralism has its limits and that it is essential to form a coalition with Asia and the world to solve these global challenges. First of all, I would like Mr. Kishida to share such a sense of crisis and the idea of a fateful community through a summit meeting with China, which has the largest population in the world and is Japan's indispensable trading partner, and find a common way to world peace.",OPINION,VIEWPOINT,Kazuyuki Hamada Photo: Courtesy of Hamada,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'Japan': ('LOC', 10), 'Spain': ('LOC', 1), 'Asia': ('LOC', 2), 'China': ('LOC', 6), 'Tokyo': ('LOC', 1), 'US': ('LOC', 5), 'India': ('LOC', 2), 'Southeast Asia': ('LOC', 4), 'Myanmar': ('LOC', 1), 'Laos': ('LOC', 1), 'Cambodia': ('LOC', 1), 'Fumio Kishida': ('PER', 2), 'Xu Yelu': ('PER', 1), 'Kazuyuki Hamada': ('PER', 1), 'Joe Biden': ('PER', 4), 'Ham': ('PER', 1), 'Asia NATO': ('ORG', 4), 'Global Times': ('ORG', 4), 'Hamada': ('ORG', 1), 'Research Institute for Future Technologies': ('ORG', 1), 'IPEF': ('ORG', 7), 'TPP': ('ORG', 1), 'Trans - Pacific Partnership': ('ORG', 1), 'RCEP': ('ORG', 1), 'Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership': ('ORG', 1), 'IP': ('ORG', 1), 'B': ('ORG', 1), 'ASEAN': ('ORG', 1), 'Summit': ('MISC', 1), 'Indo - Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity': ('MISC', 1)}"
344,"EU grants Ukraine candidate status, aims at 'prolonged military conflict' to drag down Russia",GT staff reporters,2022-06-24,"As the EU and Ukraine hailed the granting of Ukraine candidate status to the bloc, many analysts said it is more like a political gesture as a lengthy process of negotiations and domestic reforms are needed before Ukraine could formally get the membership.During the two-day EU Council meeting in Brussels, EU leaders on Thursday granted Ukraine the coveted status of official candidate to join their 27-nation club. After the official announcement was made, Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky wrote on Twitter that ""Ukraine's future is in the EU."" EU Council chief Charles Michel also tweeted that this is ""A historic moment"" and ""Our future is together.""EU's move to grant Ukraine candidate status has more political meaning - EU leaders want to show their moral support to Ukraine. As some people in the EU have talked about the rebuilding in Ukraine after the end of the current conflict, the decision of granting Ukraine a candidate status will help the EU get advantage in this field, Cui Hongjian, director of the Department of EU Studies at the China Institute of International Studies, told the Global Times. However, there is a long way for Ukraine from candidate status to membership - the lengthy negotiations with the bloc have just begun and numerous changes await Ukraine, including meeting certain economic criteria and reforming its political and legal systems, Cui said. With the oligarchical politics and economy, and corruption in Ukraine, even after the end of the military conflict, there will be uncertainties for Ukraine to get in the EU, said Cui. According to a Reuters report on Friday, reticence over EU enlargement has slowed progress towards membership for a group of Balkans countries - Albania, Bosnia, Kosovo, Montenegro, North Macedonia and Serbia.Albanian Prime Minister Edi Rama was cited by Reuters as saying that ""it's a good thing to give candidate status, but I hope the Ukraine people will not have much illusions about this.""When the Russia-Ukraine conflict started in February, the US and the EU offered to take Ukraine into the NATO and the EU - the candidate status is a huge discount to the previous promise. Ukraine will not be satisfied and stopped by the decision, but this is all the EU and the US can offer, Cui Heng, an assistant research fellow from the Center for Russia Studies of China Normal University, told the Global Times.Granting candidate status to Ukraine also leaves the EU mediatory room - it can also prolong the process for membership, Cui Heng said, noting that such an announcement is not Russia cannot accept. Cui Heng noted that since the Russia-Ukraine conflict has become an attrition warfare, there is little influence on the battleground for the EU and the US to send weapons as the EU's and the US' purposes are to drag down Russia. On the day of the announcement, the Pentagon said it will provide an additional $450 million in security assistance to Ukraine, including more long-range rocket systems. Earlier on Tuesday, Ukraine said the first delivery of Germany howitzers and other heavy weapons had arrived. Cui Hongjian noted that being a candidate of the EU will help Ukraine seek more support from the bloc and will help encourage Ukraine soldiers. But whether this announcement will influence the battleground depends on how the Ukraine government will use this opportunity.",CHINA,DIPLOMACY,"Flags of the European Union fly outside the EU headquarters in Brussels, Belgium, May 21, 2021.  (Xinhua/Zheng Huansong)",Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'EU Council': ('ORG', 15), 'Department of EU Studies': ('ORG', 15), 'China Institute of International Studies': ('ORG', 2), 'Global Times': ('ORG', 1), 'Reuters': ('ORG', 2), 'NATO': ('ORG', 1), 'Center': ('ORG', 1), 'University': ('ORG', 1), 'Ukraine': ('LOC', 19), 'Brussels': ('LOC', 1), 'Balkans': ('LOC', 1), 'Albania': ('LOC', 1), 'Bosnia': ('LOC', 1), 'Kosovo': ('LOC', 1), 'Montenegro': ('LOC', 1), 'North Macedonia': ('LOC', 1), 'Serbia': ('LOC', 1), 'Russia': ('LOC', 2), 'US': ('LOC', 2), 'China': ('LOC', 1), 'Volodymyr Zelensky': ('PER', 1), 'Charles Michel': ('PER', 1), 'Cui Hongjian': ('PER', 3), 'Edi Rama': ('PER', 1), 'Albanian': ('MISC', 1)}"
345,"NATO, US put Ukraine’s EU membership in dilemma",Global Times,2022-06-22,"Ukraine is set to become an official candidate for EU (EU) membership at the EU summit to be held on Thursday and Friday. Several EU diplomats confirmed Tuesday that no countries raised objections at a meeting of the bloc's ambassadors on Monday. In the context of the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict, Ukraine's EU candidacy appears to be a symbolic decision, through which EU countries have reaffirmed their political support for Ukraine and encouraged the EU country to ""hang in there"" in the war.Apparently, the EU has been completely hijacked by NATO and the US vis-à-vis this war. Facing a dilemma, it had no choice but to open its arms to Ukraine's membership, because supporting Ukraine - no matter what - has become new ""political correctness"" in the West.Cui Hongjian, director of the Department of EU Studies at the China Institute of International Studies, told the Global Times that for EU, Ukraine's EU candidacy makes up for its failure to join NATO the military alliance.Moscow has long voiced its opposition against Kiev's potential NATO membership. However, Russia President Vladimir Putin said on Friday that Russia is not against Ukraine joining the EU.""Unlike NATO, the EU is not a military organization or a military-political bloc… It is a sovereign decision of any country whether it wants to join an economic association and it is for the economic association to decide whether it accepts new members,"" he explained, as cited by the official website of the President of Russia.In Cui's view, EU's decision on Ukraine means Ukraine has earned more significant support from the EU, and made one more step toward the West, compared to the Crimean crisis in 2014.EU countries seem to have reached a consensus on Ukraine's candidacy out of sympathy, as they see Ukraine as a victim of the war. But even if the EU's decision can comfort the war-torn Ukraine, it will unlikely ease the ""Ukraine fatigue"" that many EU nations have began to suffer.According to China military expert and TV commentator Song Zhongping, these countries are weary of the war and they are tired of providing various kinds of aid to Ukraine by sacrificing their own interests.The military conflict between Moscow and Kiev hasn't ended quickly as the West had anticipated. Instead, it has shown a tendency to become a prolonged one. For EU, this means the growing divergences on the crisis within the EU.Many EU countries are suffering from the consequences of the war: soaring inflation, energy shortages, and even increased social divisions and political tensions.Cui believes for these countries, more pain, especially on the economy, is yet to come. For example, EU has just begun to feel the retroaction of the sanctions on Russia. More rounds of sanctions may lead to greater economic losses for the EU countries. Experts say Ukraine still has a long way to go before it officially becomes an EU member, as many requirements need to be met.France's minister for EU affairs Clement Beaune said in May that it would take 15 to 20 years for Ukraine to join the EU, while France President Emmanuel Macron suggested it could take ""decades.""But even if Ukraine becomes part of the EU, it might still face obstacles. For instance, Vladimir Putin questioned in his Friday speech in St Petersburg whether it was ""advisable"" for the EU to take Ukraine on as a new member, given the large amount of needed subsidies and support.And it is unclear if Ukraine will be treated equally. ""Without changing itself to fit EU's standards, Ukraine would never be on par with other members,"" noted Song.",OPINION,OBSERVER,Illustration: Chen Xian/Global Times,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'Ukraine': ('LOC', 15), 'Russia': ('LOC', 4), 'US': ('LOC', 1), 'West': ('LOC', 3), 'Moscow': ('LOC', 2), 'Kiev': ('LOC', 2), 'China': ('LOC', 1), 'EU': ('ORG', 20), 'NATO': ('ORG', 4), 'Department of EU Studies': ('ORG', 21), 'China Institute of International Studies': ('ORG', 1), 'Global Times': ('ORG', 1), 'Cui Hongjian': ('PER', 2), 'Vladimir Putin': ('PER', 1), 'Crimean': ('MISC', 1)}"
346,Xi offers answers to questions of the times at BRICS forum,Yang Sheng,2022-06-23,"China President Xi Jinping on Wednesday offered his answers to the questions of the times at a keynote speech in virtual format at the opening ceremony of the BRICS Business Forum in Beijing and called for joint efforts to seek and safeguard peace as he said ""the Ukraine crisis has again sounded the alarm for humanity."" He also urged efforts to strengthen global economic governance and increase the representation and voices of emerging markets and developing countries, and experts said this has pointed out the correct directions to solve current challenges that are threatening global development and recovery.Xi Jinping will also host the 14th BRICS Summit on June 23 and the High-level Dialogue on Global Development on June 24. Experts said when US-led West mechanisms like the G7 and NATO are also going to hold their summits later this month, it is significant and necessary for China and other major emerging economies as well as developing countries in the BRICS Plus, that represent the majority of the international community to voice their joint stance over the current global challenges and crisis, and to boost unity to find a correct direction to realize recovery.The G7 and NATO summits will continually intensify existing tensions and crisis, and will focus on bloc-to-bloc confrontation and major power competition to target China and Russia and preserve the US-dominated global order, said analysts. They noted this will make the world more divided than united, so it is important for China and other BRICS members to present their views that could better address the concerns shared by the majority of the international community, and point out the consequences of the wrong direction guided by the US.    Xi Jinping also called on major developed countries to avoid negative spillover effects of their policies and prevent severe shocks for developing countries, and he also said ""sanctions are a boomerang and a double-edged sword"" that ""will only end up hurting one's own interests as well as those of others, and inflict suffering on everyone.""Russia President Vladimir Putin, India Prime Minister Narendra Modi, South Africa President Cyril Ramaphosa and Brazil President Jair Bolsonaro attended the opening ceremony and delivered speeches virtually on Wednesday, while the offline ceremony was held at Beijing Diaoyutai State Guest House. The attendees also called to boost economic globalization and integration while opposing sanctions and decoupling, as this is the key to realizing global recovery after COVID-19 pandemic. China analysts said the BRICS is an organization formed by major emerging economies with constructive influence to add more certainty to a world in turmoil, while the US-led West system is trying to further tear the world apart and intensify confrontations rather than seeking solutions to global challenges via cooperation. Rightful order ""It has been proved time and again that sanctions are a boomerang and a double-edged sword. To politicize the global economy and turn it into one's tool or weapon, and willfully impose sanctions by using one's primary position in the international financial and monetary systems will only end up hurting one's own interests as well as those of others, and inflict suffering on everyone,"" Xi Jinping noted.""The Ukraine crisis is another wake-up call for all in the world. It reminds US that blind faith in the so-called 'position of strength' and attempts to expand military alliances and seek one's own security at the expense of others will only land oneself in a security dilemma,"" Xi Jinping said.This is direct criticism toward the US and some West countries who instigated problems between Russia and Ukraine via NATO expansion and forced or threatened other countries to join their sanctions against Russia after the crisis, said China analysts, noting that the BRICS countries share a similar neutral position on the Ukraine crisis and they also receive similar pressure from the West on the issue of sanctioning Russia. Now they are expressing unity between emerging economies to withstand the pressure and act independently to safeguard their shared interests of cooperation and development.Vladimir Putin said in his speech that ""more and more politically motivated sanctions are continuously introduced, mechanisms of exerting pressure on competitors are further strengthened. There is intentional destruction of cooperation ties; transport and logistics chains are destroyed. And all this is contrary to common sense and basic economic logic, it undermines business interests on a global scale, negatively affecting the wellbeing of people, in effect, of all countries.""Modi said ""BRICS was established with the belief that this group of emerging economies could emerge as engines of global growth. Today, when the world is focusing on post-COVID-19 recovery, the role of BRICS countries will be very important.""Wang Lei, director of the BRICS Cooperation Center at Beijing Normal University, told the Global Times that the trend for global recovery is very weak and fragile, which is a main task for the BRICS Business Forum this time. ""Although the cooperation mechanisms formed by developed countries like the G7 will also set the global recovery agenda, in fact, they are driven by the task of preserving the existing system dominated by the US or the West, and this makes them unable to address the global challenges fairly,"" Wang said. This means it will not be a practical and effective mechanism that could unite major emerging economies but will only create more divergences, he noted.The BRICS mechanism provides a stage for the voices of developing countries to be heard, said Zhu Xufeng, executive director of the Institute for Sustainable Development Goals, Tsinghua University. Amid a shifting international landscape and global pandemic, the five countries have become a ballast for global economic development, Zhu noted.""China is the biggest economy in the BRICS, and in order to promote the BRICS mechanism to play more effective role, China has provided the platform for fair communication and also offered public goods to the world for joint development,"" like the Belt and Road Initiative, and it will continually work with other partners under the BRICS and BRICS Plus mechanism to contribute more positive energy to the world in turbulence, Zhu noted. Key for recoveryXi said that ""The BRICS mechanism is an important cooperation platform for emerging markets and developing countries. The business community is a dynamic force driving BRICS' effective cooperation.""""BRICS cooperation has now entered a new stage of high-quality development. I hope that you business leaders will continue to act with tenacity and in a pioneering spirit, and champion open, innovative and shared development so as to add new impetus to BRICS cooperation.""Xi Jinping also said China will continue to enhance opening-up and foster a business environment that is based on market principles, governed by law and up to international standards. He also encouraged businesses to invest and develop in China, enhance trade and economic cooperation, and share development opportunities.Attendees from business circles worldwide echoed the call and said the inter-connectivity and integration is key to recovery. The decoupling trend and sanctions promoted by the West that could harm the global supply and value chains will be harmful to the world's efforts to realize global recovery, and many of them place hope on China to guide the direction for recovery. Open trade is an important element of a connected world, Busi Mabuza, Chairperson of the Industrial Development Corporation of South Africa, said on Wednesday at the BRICS Business Forum.""Trade and market openness have historically gone hand-in-hand with better economic performance in countries at all levels of development, creating new opportunities for workers, consumers, and firms around the globe and helping to lift millions out of poverty,"" Mabuza said.""Integration is a golden thread of the world economy. Digitization has accelerated international integration enabling the increased flow of trade, capital, money, direct investment, technology, people, information and ideas across national boundaries. Therefore, the global economic recovery after COVID-19 pandemic will rely on how we leverage the integration,"" Mabuza said.Yousef Al-Benyan, vice Chairman and CEO of Saudi Basic Industries Corporation (SABIC), said on Wednesday that ""The world economy is seriously ill. Its lifeblood - international trade - has become weak, sluggish and congested. After rebounding to double-digits in 2021, the annual growth rate of trade volume is now expected to dwindle down to low single-digit rates.""""If I, who comes from outside the BRICS countries, can exemplify the increased openness that our world sorely needs, then I would be extremely satisfied with my participation here today,"" said Al-Benyan. Much of the world's future investment in petrochemicals is expected to end up in China. And a good portion of that will have to come from foreign direct investments (FDI), he noted.Wang Yiwei, director of the Institute of International Affairs at the Renmin University of China, told the Global Times that more and more countries sense that the West-dominated or the US-dominated orders that push decoupling by using the excuses of resilience and security of supply chains are problematic, and will divide the world into pieces. Since developing countries like the BRICS are contributing more than developed countries in terms of the world economic growth, world order will be more reasonable and fairer.",CHINA,DIPLOMACY,"Chinese President Xi Jinping delivers a keynote speech in virtual format at the opening ceremony of the BRICS Business Forum, June 22, 2022.Photo: Xinhua","Reporter, Beijing","Yang Sheng is a chief reporter at the Global Times covering Chinese politics, diplomacy and military.","{'China': ('LOC', 5), 'Beijing': ('LOC', 1), 'Ukraine': ('LOC', 1), 'Russia': ('LOC', 2), 'India': ('LOC', 1), 'South Africa': ('LOC', 1), 'Brazil': ('LOC', 1), 'BeijingVID': ('LOC', 1), 'Xi Jinping': ('PER', 3), 'Vladimir Putin': ('PER', 1), 'Cyril Rama': ('PER', 1), 'Jai': ('PER', 1), 'Bo': ('PER', 1), 'BRICS Business Forum': ('ORG', 3), 'G7': ('ORG', 2), 'NATO': ('ORG', 2), '14th BRICS Summit': ('MISC', 1), 'Dialogue on Global Development': ('MISC', 1), 'US': ('MISC', 3), 'West': ('MISC', 1), 'BRICS Plus': ('MISC', 1)}"
347,Wild ambition of NATO against public’s will,Lu Xue,2022-06-23,"Editor's Note: NATO, which is constantly looking for imaginary enemies and justifying its existence by inciting confrontation, is about to hold a summit, and it also plans to extend its tentacles to the Asia-Pacific region. Behind its aggressive narrative, contradictions and divisions within NATO have become increasingly prominent. The Russia-Ukraine conflict is not going according to NATO's playbook. This series of articles will provide some clues regarding NATO's predicament. This is the first piece.The Russia-Ukraine conflict, which was triggered by NATO's aggressive expansion, has lasted for nearly four months, during which severe sanctions have been imposed by NATO members against Russia. Ironically, the impact of these sanctions on the bloc is no less evident. West and US media outlets report their concern over the energy and food crisis resulted from their sanctions against Russia almost on a daily basis.There is a China saying describing a poor strategy that ""to injure 1,000 enemy soldiers, one loses 800 of its own,"" which indicates a lose-lose approach toward an adversary. It can apply to what the NATO has done against itself. It is noticeable that the West's tone toward Russia on the ongoing crisis has changed subtly recently. Some voices have emerged, shifting from calling NATO members to firmly support Ukraine against Russia to considering persuading Ukraine to cede territory in return for peace. And reports on ""Ukraine fatigue"" in the West could also been spotted. This indicates that the West has been forced to adjust its strategic objectives regarding the Russia-Ukraine crisis. West politicians may have previously thought that their joint sanctions against Russia, in addition to military aid to Ukraine, would help them defeat Russia swiftly. Yet judging from the current situation, they seem to be drifting further away from their goals.When the West hawks are hailing the Russia's loss, their own countries have also sacrificed significant interests in other fields, ranging from environmental protection goal, the public's wellbeing and the sustainable development of their economies. The resulting inflation monster has heavily affected the daily life of ordinary people. Furthermore, the rising gas price spells more coal use, which is at odds with the carbon emission advocated by the West elites. This is a backset toward global climate goal.In the initial stage of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, it was widely believed that Russia was much stronger than Ukraine, while the combined strength of NATO members was much stronger than that of Russia. However as the crisis drags on, it has raised the question as to why NATO's estimated strength has not been turned into real power. ""NATO's strength has never been verified in practice. It is only estimated that when the bloc sanctions Russia to the extreme extent, it would severely put the country in trouble at home and abroad, or even arouse regime instability,"" a China expert on international relations, who requested anonymity, told the Global Times. But it turns out it would only be their illusion. Politicians of certain West countries should reflect and learn a lesson that it is not feasible to use hard power to achieve their policy goals at every turn. Imposing economic hardship on Russia will not win the hearts and minds of people.France President Emmanuel Macron in 2019 described NATO as ""brain dead,"" which raises many Westerners' doubt on the significance of the bloc's existence. Many politicians of NATO members see the Ukraine crisis as an opportunity to revive the bloc. But the current situation will frustrate them as more internal contradictions of the military alliance have emerged. The NATO has become a troublemaker. Its legitimacy cannot be restored. And it is likely to encounter more problems.""The main driver to deteriorate the Russia-Ukraine conflict is NATO. The bloc's relations with Russia have been even worse, and it seems it needs to prepare for providing Ukraine military support in the long term,"" according to Cui Hongjian, director of the Department of EU Studies at the China Institute of International Studies. As the NATO Summit scheduled for next week has invited Asia countries such as Japan and South Korea, many observers say the bloc would expand its tentacles to Asia-Pacific. When NATO grows increasingly larger - from its previous range focusing only on the North Atlantic, to targeting Indo-Pacific region, from a defensive organization to a collective security bloc - it will only face more challenges and uncertainties, as it itself has been keeping bringing security uncertainties to other regions, said the China experts.NATO is increasingly trapped in a predicament that it may feel difficult to escape. Any action that does not conform to the principles of the UN Charter goes against people's hearts and minds. In this context, even though hard power could prevail, it will not achieve the goal.The author is a reporter with the Global Times. opinion@globaltimes.com.cn.",OPINION,VIEWPOINT,Illustration: Liu Rui/Global Times,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'NATO': ('ORG', 9), 'Asia': ('LOC', 1), 'Pacific': ('LOC', 1), 'Russia': ('LOC', 13), 'Ukraine': ('LOC', 9), 'West': ('LOC', 7), 'US': ('LOC', 1), 'China': ('LOC', 1)}"

349,Egyptian Red Sea resort Sharm el-Sheikh reels from Ukrainian and Russian exodus,Reuters,2022-06-23,"On Sharm el-Sheikh's sandy beaches many of the sun loungers lie empty. At a central promenade packed with shops, cafes and nightclubs, crowds are thinner than usual.The resort on the southern tip of Egypt's Sinai Peninsula is reeling from the impact of the war in Ukraine, which has seen Ukrainians and Russia - ­previously among the town's top visitors - virtually disappear, tourism sector workers say.Their absence has delivered the latest in a series of shocks to a sector that accounts for up to 15 percent of gross domestic product and generates sorely needed foreign currency.""Months ago, we were catching our breath after coronavirus hit and activity was beginning to recover, but we got out of the frying pan into the fire,"" said the owner of a small souvenir shop on the main promenade in Sharm el-Sheikh's Naama Bay who gave his name as Ashraf, adding that he'd lost about two-thirds of his business.Egypt's tourism revenues dipped sharply during the ­COVID-19 pandemic, recovering to nearly $12 billion in 2021, according to central bank data.The sector had received a boost when Russia resumed direct flights to Sharm el-Sheikh and fellow Red Sea resort Hurghada in August 2021, six years after the crash of a passenger jet carrying Russia tourists led to their suspension.Though no updated data is available for this year, a briefing by the cabinet last month warned of a major hit to foreign currency income from tourism.The government, which is also struggling with rising wheat and oil import bills, recently revised its growth forecast for the financial year ending this month down to 5.5 percent, and for 2022-23 to 4.5 percent.

Photo: AFPIn Sharm el-Sheikh, which will host the COP27 climate conference in November, signs are written in Russia as well as English, and some hotel staff are trained in both languages.It's an indication of the importance of the market - Russia and Ukraine visitors accounted for 31 percent of tourist numbers in Egypt last year, according to the government, many of them coming on package tours to Sharm el-Sheikh and Hurghada.Over the final six months of last year, more than 1.1 million Russia and about 794,000 Ukrainians visited Egypt, ­according to government data.Since the launch of military operation by Russia in Ukraine on February 24, Russia visits to Sharm el-Sheikh have dropped to a fraction of their former levels, two tour operators and two guides in the town said. Nearly all the 20,000 Ukrainians in Egypt resorts at the outbreak of the war have been flown out. ""We lost about 70 percent of occupancy after the war,"" said the manager of one large hotel who declined to be named as he was not authorized to speak to media.""There's a slight rise in numbers from Armenia and Romania, but none of these numbers can be compared with those from Ukraine and Russia before the war.""Just 1,500-2,000 Russia have been arriving each week, said Adel Hosny, the South Sinai contracting manager for Russia-based tour operator Pegas Touristik.Demand dropped as West sanctions drove up travel times and costs from Russia by forcing carriers to change routes, and MasterCard and Visa credit cards issued in ­Russia stopped working abroad. Daily flights are expected to resume from Russia from early July.Spending by those Russia still coming to Sharm el-Sheikh had dwindled because they had limited access to dollars, said Ahmed Akrab, a tour guide.",TRAVEL,GALLERY,"A picture taken on September 29, 2021 shows Russian tourists in the Egyptian Red Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheikh.

350,BRICS provides new voices in transformative world,Santiago Bustelo,2022-06-23,"In the last decade the BRICS grouping of major emerging economies - Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa - has become one of the most fundamental forces in the international geo-economic landscape. Since its first formal summit in 2009, through continued diplomatic activity, economic cooperation and strategic dialogue, the group has consolidated shared views on the role of emerging economies in the global system, especially regarding the reform of global governance and multilateral institutions.On Thursday, a new edition of the BRICS Summit will take place, where China President Xi Jinping, Russia President Vladimir Putin, India Prime Minister Narendra Modi, South Africa President Cyril Ramaphosa and Brazil President Jair Bolsonaro will meet virtually to discuss the current global situation.In the present troubled international scenario, with the conflict in Ukraine as a backdrop along the uncertain economic situation at a global level, mounting inflation in West countries, and rising global prices of basic commodities that threaten the development of various emerging countries, the voice of the BRICS as a mechanism for cooperation is more important than ever. Undoubtedly the economic and geopolitical implications of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, financial mechanisms to deal with the sanctions imposed by the US, EU, as well as common measures to stabilize the economic global situation will be central items on the summit's agenda. None of the BRICS nations have joined the West countries in the economic sanctions against Russia, making it clear that the solution to the conflict must go through a negotiated process and not through sanctions. Not only have the BRICS countries refrained from emulating financial sanctions, but also most developing nations decided to stay out of these coercive measures that generate greater turbulence in the international economic system.The summit is also expected to give increasing importance to multilateral economic cooperation in fields such as green development, the digital economy and infrastructure investments, as well as enhancing capacity production and supply chains. An important novelty in the framework of BRICS cooperation is the recent process of expanding the membership of its New Development Bank (NDB), which opens the doors to other emerging countries to access to funds for sustainable infrastructure construction as well as other cooperation initiatives. In early 2021, the NDB's leaders held talks with Bangladesh, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Uruguay, and Egypt for their incorporation to the NDB. Negotiations were successful with each of these four countries, and in late 2021 they became the first cohort of non-founding members to join the NDB. It is possible to envision that in the future many other countries of the Global South may join this promising international financial institution. Within the BRICS structure, the NDB can play a fundamental role by providing funds to emerging countries in Asia, Africa, the Middle East and Latin US for interconnectivity projects for deeper regional integration to enhance cross-border capital flows and investment within developing nations. This is particularly important, for example, for Latin US countries, where financing for infrastructure projects that strengthen regional integration is urgently needed. A greater economic and physical integration between BRICS and emerging countries will bring immense opportunities in terms of food security, sustainable development and technological cooperation.The complex international situation requires today more than ever the coordination of emerging countries with the aim of stabilizing the global economy and working to restart a growth path that allows developing nations to overcome the dramatic effects of the pandemic. The BRICS, representing the largest emerging economies today, have managed in recent decades to establish important mechanisms for dialogue and cooperation to provide new voices in a world in transformation. There is clear evidence that the present context is characterized by enormous possibilities and opportunities that are typical of times of crisis and paradigm shifts. Creativity and use of windows of opportunity can potentially give rise to new scenarios for emerging countries in the global system. It is up to developing nations themselves to be proactive and establish a common strategy that takes advantage of the transforming trends that are appearing in the new international geopolitical and economic architecture. Having reached a considerable degree of institutionalization as well as establishing new multilateral organizations such as the NDB, the BRICS may become in the coming years the platform for developing countries to have greater weight in decisions about the destinies of humanity.The author holds a PhD degree in International Politics from Fudan University.

However, former president Donald Trump pulled the US out of the agreement in May 2018 and reimposed US's unilateral sanctions on Tehran, prompting Iran to reduce some of its nuclear commitments under the agreement in retaliation.Since April 2021, several rounds of talks have been held in the Austrian capital between Iran and the remaining JCPOA parties to revive the deal.Iran insists on obtaining guarantees that the succeeding US governments would not drop the deal again and calls for lifting the sanctions in a verifiable manner. After witnessing good progress signaling that an agreement was only a few days away, the diplomatic process has, however, faced a pause since March, raising concerns over the fate of the negotiation.Xinhua",WORLD,MID-EAST,"Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov speaks during his annual press conference in Moscow, capital of Russia.

353,Decade of rapid expansion in China-Europe rail service attests to achievement of BRI,GT staff reporters,2022-06-23,"Editor's Note:In 2013, China President Xi Jinping put forward the ""Belt and Road Initiative"" (BRI), aiming at building a new platform for international cooperation and creating new momentum for shared development. Since then, the BRI has opened a path for high quality development and common prosperity for countries along the route, becoming a real global platform serving more than half of the world's population.While developing rapidly over the years, China has also made great contribution to global connectivity under the initiative, helping build a mega global transportation network covering road rail and sea ways and integrating a number of countries into the global supply chain.The Global Times is publishing a series of stories, helping the world understand how BRI facilitates connectivity and foster growth. Among the good examples are the booming auto trade business between China and EU buoyed by the resilient China-EU freight train service.The sixth anniversary of the opening of the train service falls on June 20, and the Global Times interviewed senior traders in corresponding industries, who shared how the cross-continental train service has become an increasingly important player in enhancing China-EU trade.This is the second in a series about a monumental decade for BRI.By Global Times staff reportersA China-EU freight train with more than 100 cars produced by Great Wall Motors of China, departed from Chongqing city in Southwest China on Wednesday and will be shipped abroad via Alashankou Port, a major border port in China. The train is the very first train from Chongqing heading to EU specially used to transport the vehicles of Great Wall Motors, which serves as the latest example of the fledgling auto trade.Since 2017, China-EU freight train service starting from Chongqing have transported a total of 15-billion-yuan worth of imported and exported vehicles, promoting the deep integration of the vehicle industry chain along the Belt and Road Initiative route.Driven by the trend of booming auto business between China and EU, China high-tech companies including BYD and TCL Technology have opened factories in Poland, Hungary, the Netherlands, and other locations in EU in recent years to meet the expanding needs of the consumers there, while China-EU trains have become an important means for transport between China and EU.Since 2016, more than 90 percent of the parts and components required by the six key production lines of the TCL assembly base in Poland have been transported via China-EU freight train service, boosting local inventory and market response capabilities. The China-EU freight train service's boost for the auto industry is just part of how the 13,000-kilometer cross-continental transport line linking China and EU has played a foundational role in stabilizing global supply chain, while injecting new momentum to growing each other's economy under BRI.From 2016 to 2021, the annual number of China-EU freight trains increased from 1,702 to 15,183, with an average annual growth rate of 55 percent while the annual value of goods transported rose from $8 billion to $74.9 billion, a nine-fold increase. Moreover, the rail service's share of total trade between China and EU rose to 8 percent in 2021 from 1.5 percent, helping their supply chain stability.The ever-expanding China-EU freight train service and the ever closer connectivity between China and EU as well as between Asia and EU attest to the remarkable achievement over the past nine years or so of the China-proposed BRI, which aims to build an open platform of cooperation, and providing new impetus for cooperation and development among countries. Growing rail serviceWith a decade-long experience in providing the one-stop service for multimodal transport of China-EU trains, Tommy Tan, president of Shanghai EPU Supply Chain Management Co, an agent for China-EU freight trains, is an eyewitness of how the freight train service has become the bedrock for enlarging China-EU trade.Tan's business involves a wide variety of trade categories, such as timber trade between China and Russia, grain and fertilizer trade between China and Kazakhstan, and auto parts trade between China and EU.Starting in 2018, they have imported about 40 containers from Nuremberg to Chengdu, Southwest China's Sichuan Province on a weekly basis, involving all accessories except batteries and air bags for BMW's factories in China.The company's trade service has been successfully operating for four years, with a total of 200 trains being launched, and a total import value surpassing 10 billion yuan, significantly supporting BMW's local production, according to Tan.Impacted by the breakout of the Ukraine crisis, the train service has been suspended for more than two months, Tan said, adding they are negotiating to prepare for the rail service's resumption.Rise to challengeDespite the military conflict in EU and the COVID-19 resurgence in China , which have thrown an element of uncertainty into cross border trade, the China-EU freight train service has remained resilient, being an effective supplement to sea freight.Sources told the Global Times that since the first China-EU train carrying Audi cars arrived in Xi Jinping'an from Bremerhaven in October 2020, the epidemic situation has been constantly changing. But the train service has always been well managed.When West sanctions against Moscow over the Russia-Ukraine conflict created unprecedented challenges for cross-border trade, many EU companies are chipping away at the potential risks of disruption for logistic services.The China-EU freight train remains a leading option for many international traders, given its competitive advantage, especially as the sea transport experienced a severe bottleneck last year - as port backlog has lingered in many EU ports.A trader connected to the China-EU freight train based in Yiwu, Zhejiang Province, who has always been a big supporter of the cargo train service, told the Global Times on Thursday that from Hamburg Port in Germany to Ningbo Port, import transportation takes 55-65 days, while the train service takes only 18 days, and the price has remained stable at around $1,000, similar to ocean freight.While there are multiple factors that contribute to low cost, the high efficiency of China ports certainly plays a part. For example, at Manzhouli port, North China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, a major border port for the rail service, the customs has ensured that the train is available for inspection 24 hours a day, which greatly reduces the time cost of each link in the customs clearance, the Global Times learned.Now, there are 57 China-EU trains entering and leaving the country through the Manzhouli railway station, reaching 13 countries and 28 cities in EU. The goods include auto parts and other varieties.Given the competitive edge, there has been hardly any disruption to the train service even with the geopolitical tensions in EU, industry analysts say.",SOURCE,B&R INITIATIVE,Manzhouli port customs officers inspect the China-Europe train at the Manzhouli port.

354,Chinese companies strive to help alleviate Pakistan’s power shortages,GT staff reporters,2022-06-23,"China's energy infrastructure developers and operators are striving to help ensure the timely delivery and smooth operation of power facilities in Pakistan, which is coping with severe power shortages amid extreme weather and high coal prices.Industry sources told the Global Times on Thursday that they had noted the difficulties in Pakistan and their teams were making their best efforts to address the challenges. Some power projects, which are under construction or near completion, are expected to greatly improve power supply in Pakistan, companies said. China Three Gorges Corp, which is completing the 720-megawatt (mW) Karot hydropower project on the Jhelum River in Pakistan's eastern Punjab province, told the Global Times in an emailed statement on Thursday that when the project starts operating, it is expected to relieve more than 10 percent of the reported 6,500-mW power gap in Pakistan.A China state-owned energy company told the Global Times on condition of anonymity that the current coal price is so high that it has pushed up the cost of power generation, but the company is operating at a loss to make a contribution to society.The flagship China-Pakistan Economic Corridor project is expected to improve Pakistan's energy structure and push the country's sustainable development, according to China Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian in May. Once fully operational, it will provide stable and affordable energy supply to Pakistan and meet the electricity demand of roughly 5 million locals.Affected by the Russia-Ukraine conflict, the international coal price has been soaring since March, and while there was a slight drop in May, it is still at a record high, industry experts said.The knock-on effect of the global energy price surge has led to unprecedented challenges for many developing countries, including Pakistan.Electricity demand in Pakistan is around 26,000 mW, but supply is only about COVID-19,500 mW, media outlets have reported.In Karachi, Pakistan's largest city, residents in some areas may experience power outages for 8-10 hours or more every day. In some rural areas, it could be as long as 16 hours a day, media reports said. High temperatures also put huge pressure on power supply in Pakistan.China Energy Engineering Corp (Energy China), another major power supplier, is upgrading power supplies in Pakistan, with several key projects recently landing on the ground.For example, on May 26, the first gas turbine of the Punjab Power Plant Jhang in Pakistan was connected to the power grid for the first time. The 1,263-mW power project was constructed by a subsidiary of Energy China, according to a document the company sent to the Global Times.After the completion of the project, it will greatly relieve the power shortages of local enterprises and the surrounding area, Energy China said.As one of the largest gas-fired, combined cycle power plants in Pakistan, the Punjab plant is expected to add 1.3 gigawatts to the country's grid, according to media reports.This comes just two months after another key project with the participation of China companies - the Bin Qasim Power Station-III (BQPS-III) - completed the first firing of its generation unit of 450 mW in mid-March, which means the engine can serve about 150,000 homes in the city of Karachi, Pakistan.With an investment of over $650 million, the BQPS-III power plant is the utility's flagship project that will cumulatively add 900 mW of energy to secure Karachi's growing demand.Energy China said that hydropower projects in Pakistan are also under construction.",SOURCE,ECONOMY,China Pakistan File photo:VCG,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'China': ('LOC', 5), 'Pakistan': ('LOC', 14), 'Karot': ('LOC', 1), 'Jhelum River': ('LOC', 1), 'Punjab': ('LOC', 2), 'Russia': ('LOC', 1), 'Ukraine': ('LOC', 1), 'Karachi': ('LOC', 1), 'Global Times': ('ORG', 3), 'China Three Gorges Corp': ('ORG', 2), 'Economic': ('ORG', 1), 'Foreign Ministry': ('ORG', 1), 'China -': ('MISC', 1), 'Corridor': ('MISC', 1), 'Zhao Lijian': ('PER', 1)}"
355,Adventurous NATO policy of going global and confronting China unpopular: Swedish scholar,Global Times,2022-06-23,"Editor's Note: NATO, which is constantly looking for imaginary enemies and justifying its existence by inciting confrontation, is about to hold a summit, and it also plans to extend its tentacles to the Asia-Pacific region. Behind its aggressive narrative, contradictions and divisions within NATO have become increasingly prominent. The Russia-Ukraine conflict is not going according to NATO's playbook. This series of articles will provide some clues regarding NATO's predicament. In the second piece, Ulf Sandmark (Sandmark), Chairman of the Schiller Institute in Sweden, shared his views with the Global Times (Global Times) on why he opposes Sweden's and Finland's NATO membership and why NATO's ""adventurous policy of going around the world to confront China"" will become unpopular. Global Times: You are against Sweden joining NATO. Can you explain why?Sandmark: I'm part of a campaign group against Sweden's membership of NATO. We are in the streets protesting almost every day. This is an ongoing campaign which started when we first heard about this possibility of Sweden joining NATO. I'm taking part in demonstrations and making speeches and so on.Now many people are joining US because we are quite shocked about this approach to bring Sweden and Finland into NATO. Why we are against NATO is because we are for peace and we don't want to take part in the NATO wars. Scandinavia is an area of the world that used to be a low-tension area. But now, with this possibility of Sweden joining NATO, we will have a very high-tension area. Close to our border, and especially to the border of Finland, there is the largest concentration of nuclear weapons in the world. It's the Russia naval bases at the Kola Peninsula which holds the majority of Russia's nuclear-armed submarines. So if these bases are threatened, the whole nuclear balance will be out of the window. And this would be a very huge provocation to Russia. This is creating enormous tension in our region. And in case of nuclear war we will become primary targets for nuclear attacks, if we threaten Russia in this way.Global Times: The issue of Finland and Sweden joining NATO has caused divisions within NATO. Turkey opposes the two countries' NATO membership. What do you think about the prospect of Finland and Sweden joining NATO? Will divisions within NATO expand further in the future?Sandmark: We have already seen the Turkey opposition to the NATO membership applications of Sweden and Finland, and there were negotiations on Monday in Brussels' NATO headquarters, where the Finnish and Swedish delegations met with the Turkey delegation, and they were discussing for the first time for five hours. There was optimism from the Swedish side at this time because of the effort by Turkey to take part in solving the issues, but they were far from being solved. According to security expert Jan Hallengren, Swedish Defense Research Institute, probably Sweden would not be able to join until the end of this year. If you look to the Turkey protest against Sweden's access to NATO, it is quite rational, actually, because they are involved in peace negotiations between Russia and Ukraine. They're pursuing a policy of peace, which Sweden and Finland should be doing instead of joining NATO. Besides, a nuclear confrontation or crisis in Scandinavia would endanger all the NATO members. If Sweden and Finland join, it would destabilize the whole world situation. Therefore, it's quite reasonable from the Turkey side to protest against the Swedish and Finnish NATO membership.Global Times: Recently, many leaders of EU countries mentioned ""Ukraine fatigue"", and there were even voices to persuade Ukraine to ""cede territory to seek peace."" What's your take on it? Has the conflict exposed more of NATO's stalemates?Sandmark: Absolutely, as the war in Ukraine drags on, people understand that this war is not about helping Ukraine - this was what people thought in the beginning - but now they find that this is a war to win against Russia.Now, the war in Ukraine has been turned into a NATO war against Russia, where Ukraine is more and more becoming a proxy for the US and UK, and NATO, to attack Russia. It's a very dangerous situation. And people are starting to do negotiations. The EU leaders from Germany, France, and Italy were recently going to Ukraine to try to open up some discussions. But the UK are very much against this, and immediately when there is peace negotiation or any peace effort, the UK come like a rocket to convince them that they should not make any peace and there are pressures also from the US not to have any peace negotiations.Global Times: The consequences of the Russia-Ukraine war are increasingly serious, and EU countries bear considerable losses, such as rising energy prices and inflation. Is the security threat from Russia advertised by NATO persuasive in EU society?Sandmark: Everyone in Scandinavia knew that Russia is not a threat to Scandinavia, because Russia is busy in Ukraine, it has no force to attack Sweden and Finland. There is no rush for our nations to join. They blame the prices and the inflation on Vladimir Putin instead of blaming the sanctions, which has been imposed from the West side, that has increased the inflation that was already there before. But now, we see increasing protests against such narratives. Now we are seeing rising prices and interest rates, we can have a big finance shock that will devastate the whole EU and the US economy. So we can expect to see huge protests coming out against the war policies.Global Times: Leaders of some Asia-Pacific countries, such as Japan, South Korea and Australia, are invited to the NATO summit to be held at the end of this month. Will the globalization of NATO, which the US is trying to seek, come to fruition in your opinion?Sandmark: This is also a shock to the Swedish and Scandinavian population, because they think that NATO is supposed to help defend our nations. But what we see is NATO in the Madrid summit planning to go global and to go with a policy against China. This would mean that Swedish and Finnish young men and women would be sent all the way to the other side of the globe to take part in wars if the two countries join NATO, which is not in our interests.In the summit in Spain, China is on the agenda and they have the plan to turn NATO against China. This is absolutely ridiculous. NATO, if you look at the name, it means NATO. They don't even know the geography when they bring South Korea and Japan into this summit. The UK and US are leading and controlling this. But how many members will they have in a global NATO? That would probably be fewer and fewer of the members wanting to take part in this adventurous policy of going around the world to confront China and other nations in Asia. It won't be popular. What we need now are more possibilities for solving problems we have in the world, because we have huge starvation, a huge pandemic and an economic crisis. People are revolting against this. We should find a common understanding, especially around the food crisis.

357,"Impressed by freedom of Xinjiang youth, French writer keeps publishing to unmask anti-China propaganda",Liu Xin,2022-06-23,"Editor's Note:Maxime Vivas (Vivas) is a France writer and journalist, who wrote a book titled Ouïghours, pour en finir avec les fake news (Uygurs, to put an end to the fake news) based on his two visits to China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region in 2016 and 2018. Recently, his new book Les Divagations des Antichinois en France (The ramblings of anti-China forces in France) has been published in which he wrote about how he was under attack and threats for insisting on speaking the truth. The Global Times (Global Times) reporter Liu Xin interviewed the France writer on his views on the West's rumor-mongering campaign against the Xinjiang region and their anti-China campaign as a whole.

People in Urumqi celebrate the Eid al-Adha.Photo: cnsphotoGT: You recently published a new book titled Les Divagations des Antichinois en France (The ramblings of anti-China forces in France). Could you introduce the background of publishing the book? Vivas: In July 2021, my friend Jean-Pierre Page and I published a collective book, in which we brought together 17 prestigious intellectuals from five continents. The book is called La Chine sans oeillères (China without blinders). It shows that China was not alone and it had friends everywhere who are capable of denouncing the widespread lies in media.Shortly after, a huge report of 654 pages, titled Les opérations d'influences chinoises, UN moment machiavelien (China influence operations, a Machiavellian moment) was made by the Strategic Research Institute of the Military School (IRSEM), whose sole target was China. In addition to the many repetitions, errors, even lies, we find serious contradictions throughout the pages. And then, I was intrigued by the presence of an ""associate researcher"" in the IRSEM - a senior officer of the US army. Moreover, one of the writers of the IRSEM report had worked for NATO until 2019.With my friends Jean-Pierre Page and Aymeric Monville, we then decided to write a book in response to this report and we titled it The ramblings of the Anti-China forces in France.Global Times: In the book, you mentioned the IRSEM report referred your name for 54 times and attacked you. You also unveiled the attacks and lies that some West media made against you. What kind of pressure have you gone through in recent years? Why do you keep on speaking truth? Vivas: We had indeed noticed that in its October 2021 France version, this IRSEM report mentioned my name for 54 times (61 times in its English version) and displayed eight photos of me. This seems to say, ""Wanted dead or live,"" and it is a little dangerous at a time when passions lead to violence against me.A photo in which I can be seen demonstrating in Venezuela to support Hugo Chavez was included in the report and every word the IRSEM ""researchers"" chose to wrote besides seems to alert the Pentagon that I am with the ""red"" shirts. The image is taken from the ""Mélenchon.""It must be remembered that the US wanted the fall of the Bolivarian president and they were working for it. Suddenly, the IRSEM reported to NATO and the Pentagon about the friendly behavior of a Frenchman toward a country that Barak Obama had designated as a threat to the national security of the US.The researchers had investigated me going back to the 1960s. They had found things insignificant in the eyes of a France reader: I had been a union activist, I was the host of a cultural program in a Toulouse radio, administrator of an information site, Le Grands Soir, Jean-Luc Mélenchon had written prefaces for two of my books.Nothing that defies the law or makes me an ""extremist."" But the report was published simultaneously in France and in English and for a NATO or Pentagon reader, the proof was made through me that diabolical China had diabolical support in France.Because for the US, my portrait in the IRSEM report is not a peaceful, law-abiding militant, but of an enemy. This report is an act of allegiance to the military forces of the US. There have been physical threats, threats of lawsuits and slander campaigns toward me. There was also the provisional arrest and the appearance in court of my youngest son - a plot probably used as a means of pressure against me.

Maxime Vivas Photo: Courtesy of VivasGT: Like you said, in West countries and the US, some politicians and forces are keen on making various attacks against China. For example, former US secretary of State Mike Pompeo and the Australia think tank Australia Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI). How do you think about them?Vivas: Here is what Pompeo said in front of students at Texas A&M University on April 15, 2019 when discussing his experience as director of the CIA - ""We lied, we cheated, we stole."" And he added ""It was as if we had been fully trained for this."" What's remarkable is that he said it while laughing, like someone who pranks a friend. As for his student audiences, they laughed too.There wasn't a single person in that hall of A&M that day who wasn't immoral. Pompeo's lecture was filmed and the video was broadcast on the internet all over the world, as if the whole world could admire Pompeo and the CIA for what he said.On April 15, 2019, at Texas A&M University, laughing students overheard a laughing former CIA director talking about how dishonest he had been. On April 15, 2019, at this university, there were samples of the US' yesterday, today and tomorrow - they together rejoiced in the lies and the lies inevitably had consequences on the lives of brave people living in countries that the US declares as ""enemy countries.""The ASPI is a think tank that I unmasked in my book ""Uygurs, to put an end to fake news."" The name of ASPI appears 60 times in the IRSEM report. It is a source which they often cite without looking for what it is - unforgivable fault for researchers.In February 2020, an Australia senator accused ASPI of receiving nearly $450,000 from the US State Department. ASPI protested that ""The true figure is less than half that amount.""ASPI is subsidized by the Australia government and is connected to the US defense, armaments and intelligence complex. It is an enthusiastic supporter of almost everything of the US. It is hostile to China and has become the anti-China organizationGT: You also mentioned in your new book that aside from West politicians, the media and scholars are acting McCarthyism. The media was also influenced by Machiavellianism. Could you give a further explanation? Vivas: The IRSEM report quoted me 54 times and displayed eight photos of me. Isn't that Senator McCarthy's method? Isn't this an incitement to a witch hunt at a time when passions lead to violence? The blacklist compiled by Senator McCarthy in the US included hundreds of names of people suspected of communist sympathizers: Actors, writers, musicians, dancers, and so on. These innocent people were persecuted, lost their jobs, had to flee the country. The most famous of them is Charlie Chaplin.When I was writing my book on the Uygurs, I told myself that I would have a hard time finding a publisher and if the book were published, the fire of criticism would not be against the book but against me.This is exactly what happened. The ""Silk Road"" publisher, who published my book, is the 10th publisher I have approached. The others didn't want it - even though I offered the manuscript to them - the title and the theme were enough for them to refuse.And as soon as the book was published, I and my editor were the targets of an incredible ""Vivas bashing."" With this book and those that followed, my publishers, out of caution, advised me not to make dedications in bookstores or book fairs.

A harvester picks cotton in Urumqi, capital of Xinjiang region. Photo: VCG Global Times: In your book, you have unmasked the World Uyghur Congress (WUC), the National Endowment for Democracy (NED), and organizations like Human Rights Watch (HRW) on how they made and spread lies of ""one million Uygurs being detained"" and ""genocide"" against China. Could you share more about your researches about NED?Vivas: I demonstrate that the NED, the WUC and HRW are organizations that serve the CIA. I'm not saying that because I believe it. I say it because I know it. I demonstrate it. We could also add Reporters Without Borders to the list - it caused considerable damage to China at the time of the 2008 Olympics. The fable of ""one million Uygurs imprisoned"" horrified the France people. Sometimes the number was said to be three million. There was also rumor of ""forced organ harvesting from Uygurs.""But such fake news is losing ground and the visit to Xinjiang region by the UN Human rights chief Michèle Bachelet will also help accelerate this trend. To write a book on Reporters Without Borders in 1997, I investigated and learned that funding for NED is made by the US Congress as part of the money given to the US Agency for International Development (USAID).The NED is not an NGO. A former CIA agent specializing in Latin US, Philip Agee, revealed in an interview with Canada journalist Jonah Gindin on March 22, 2005, that the NED is one of the many front organizations the CIA uses to intervene in internal affairs of countries.The NED allocates funds to organizations which are agitated in China's Hong Kong, and in the Xizang and Xinjiang autonomous regions. Founded in 2004, based in Munich, Germany, the WUC presents itself as a humanitarian organization for the defense of human rights. Several of its leaders live in the US, but campaigns for separating the Xinjiang region from China.Several WUC leaders held senior positions at Radio Free Asia (RFA) and Radio Free EU/Radio Liberty, news agencies created by the CIA. Since its inception, the WUC has been generously funded by the NED.The US dollars donated by the NED between 2016 and 2019 to the WUC and other organizations intervening in Xinjiang are earmarked for actions that look like intrusions into the internal affairs of a sovereign country for hostile purposes.Thus, the sponsor asks the beneficiaries to raise awareness among the China public and opinion leaders, to organize training seminars, to engage in global advocacy in favor of the Uygur separatists, to lobby for this at the UN and in the EU Parliament, to effectively involve other human rights NGOs, the international community, and the media, and to publish reports that will serve as documentary purpose.In France, all the demonstrations organized ""in defense of the Uygurs martyred because of their religion"" are distinguished by their profusion of ""Eastern Turkestan"" flags. This is thus the proof that the claim is not the free practice of a religion, but the ""independence of Xinjiang."" I am surprised that the observers did not notice these flags and I am sorry that personalities and elected officials lend themselves by showing in the street in operations that are in favor of the separatists of China.Recently, the Ukraine crisis has attracted a lot of attention. Many people have also mentioned the US instigated color revolutions in Arab countries and Ukraine and NED is behind these events.If we want to push the analysis further, we quickly see that Ukraine leaders are a pawn of the US. The objective is not for the Ukraine army to win the war but to weaken Russia in order to isolate the real potential target - China.Global Times: You have visited China's Xinjiang region. Are there anything that impressed you? What are the reasons the US and West media are making and spreading rumors about the region?Vivas: I went to Xinjiang in 2016 and 2018. Of all the things that impressed me in Xinjiang, one is forever etched in my memory. We were visiting a sports complex and while we were in a hallway, I was attracted by music coming from a room with its door only half closed. Curious, I pushed the door and found myself in a gym. I saw young dancers in leotards, standing at the barre and throwing one leg over their heads, in music, and without caring about the stranger who had just entered. Our hosts had not planned to show US this, which did not seem important to them. However, in my eyes, you could understand a lot about today's Xinjiang.And I told myself that, if the authorities let the fanatics win, if the fight against the ""three evil forces"" (extremism, separatism, terrorism) failed, if the madness of an Islamic caliphate prevailed in the region, the young Uygurs, their mothers and tomorrow their daughters would do without music and dance forever. They would hide their bodies. No man would ever venture into a room where they would be confined to each other, buried in long clothes, made to be slaves to men, and mothers at 13. The US has launched a global propaganda to try to curb China's advance. The Belt and Road Initiative worries them a lot. The US is on the decline. See how it decides to trade with whom and punishes those who disobey it. China is making spectacular progress, but it still has many steps to climb to achieve what it calls ""a moderately prosperous society.""  Tomorrow, when the Xinjiang region will have been far away from any risk of becoming a theocracy; when the US will have failed in the region as it had failed in Xizang, as it has just failed in Hong Kong and as it failed for more than 60 years in Cuba, the White House will launch another campaign of fake news. Just know it and be prepared for it. In the meantime, China continues its forward march which benefits all its people.",IN-DEPTH,IN-DEPTH,"A view of Urumqi, capital of Northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region Photo: VCG","Reporter, Beijing","Liu Xin co-leads the Global Times China desk.

358,China denounces NATO’s Asia reach as ‘dangerous’ as bloc intensifies anti-China rhetoric ahead of summit,Zhang Hui,2022-06-23,"US President Joe Biden will start his EU trip this weekend to use the G7 and NATO summits as platforms for coordinating with allies to jointly counter China, including inviting leaders from Australia, Japan, New Zealand and South Korea to take part for the first time. It seems NATO has found its purpose for survival through expansion worldwide, particularly seeking to extend its reach into Asia to cooperate with the US' China strategy. But China analysts warned that NATO will be further split and even face crippling as trouble and contradictions inside the organization will snowball amid NATO expansion.A senior US official said leaders from Australia, Japan, South Korea and New Zealand will for the first time join the  NATO Summit to show that the Ukraine crisis has not detracted from the West's focus on China, Reuters reported on Wednesday. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said on Wednesday that since the NATO summit will address China in their new Strategic Concept for NATO, he welcomes leaders of NATO's Asia-Pacific partners - Australia, Japan, New Zealand and South Korea - to the summit. He said NATO don't regard China as an adversary but ""we need to realize the rise of China."" He said he expects that ""allies will state that China poses some challenges to our values, our interests, and our security."" In response, Wang Wenbin, spokesperson of the China Foreign Ministry, said at Thursday's media briefing that as the world's largest military alliance led by the US, NATO is a tool for the US to maintain hegemony and manipulate a security pattern in EU, and NATO tried to copy the pattern of bloc confrontation in EU in the Asia-Pacific region, which is very dangerous and will trigger firm opposition from regional countries. NATO has already disrupted stability in EU. It should not try to do the same to the Asia-Pacific and the whole world. The Asia-Pacific is beyond the geographical scope of the North Atlantic. Countries and people in the Asia-Pacific are strongly opposed to anything said or done to extend military bloc to this region or stir up division and confrontation, Wang noted.  NATO, which was previously called by many as suffering from brain death, was revived amid the Russia-Ukraine crisis. As a strategic tool manipulated by the US, it is making a foray into Asia. But will Asia countries be puppets of the US-led NATO to work for the US' China containment strategy?According to media reports, South Korea has decided to establish a mission to the NATO in Brussels, a presidential official said Wednesday ahead of President Yoon Suk-yeol's participation in a NATO summit next week.But an official from the presidential office emphasized that attending the NATO Summit has absolutely nothing to do with the possibility of a shift toward ""anti-China"" and ""anti-Russia"" policies, South Korea media KBS reported. The new Strategic Concept to be adopted at the NATO Summit has nothing to do with South Korea, the official said.  The new concept to be endorsed by NATO leaders is expected to address threats posed by China, according to Reuters. Lü Chao, an expert on the Korean Peninsula issue at the Liaoning Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times that unlike Japan, which mainly seeks to counter China's influence using NATO, South Korea developing relations with NATO was more of a symbolic hope to raise its status and strength in participating in international affairs, instead of targeting China.In meeting with State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi on Wednesday, South Korea Ambassador to China Jang Ha-sung, who is leaving his post, said that during his three-year stint as ambassador, he has witnessed the major achievements of South Korea-China relations, and he believes that bilateral friendship and practical cooperation will be further deepened.Lü believes South Korea President Yoon Suk-yeol has seen clearly that developing ties with China will not only benefit both countries but contribute to regional peace and stability, and it will not completely side with the US. But analysts warned that that does not mean China-South Korea relations will be smooth sailing, as according to local media, Seoul is thinking of enabling the full-fledged operation of a THAAD anti-missile unit which would seriously undermine China-South Korea relations if it went on with the operation, analysts said. ""If the quadrilateral meeting of the four Asia nations does happen during the NATO Summit, the main elements in the talks will probably involve economic and trade cooperation, and geo-security,"" Da Zhigang, director of the Institute of Northeast Asia Studies at Heilongjiang Provincial Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times on Thursday. ""The four countries may also explore the prospect of their independent development outside of the US-led NATO and G7.""Because this potential four-party meeting would not involve the US, Da said the talks are not likely to target China explicitly.""The possibility of Japan and Australia steering the conversation toward the 'China threat theory' cannot be ruled out, but that topic would not be welcomed by South Korea and New Zealand,"" he said.Further split   As to whether NATO could successfully expand in Asia, to include countries such as Japan into its membership to serve the US' China containment strategy, China analysts said it is unlikely to materialize.  First, residents of many NATO members including the US will not allow their governments to keep finding themselves new enemies, when Russia-Ukraine conflict has led to souring energy prices and other serious consequences such as raising people's living costs, Wang Yiwei, director of the Institute of International Affairs at the Renmin University of China, told the Global Times. Around 70,000 Belgian workers marched through Brussels where NATO headquarters is located this week demanding government action to tackle rising living costs, Reuters reported. Belgian inflation hit 9 percent in June, mirroring sharp increases elsewhere driven primarily by the impact of the Russia-Ukraine conflict on supply chains and energy and commodity prices, media reported. Song Zhongping, a Beijing-based military expert, told the Global Times that even if some Asia countries wanted to be NATO members, NATO would not accept them due to membership restrictions. NATO clearly said that countries with territorial disputes will be a factor in determining whether to invite a state to the alliance, and Japan clearly does not meet the requirement. The US is losing control of NATO as it has been split with many EU members having their own concerns, and many NATO members cannot risk losing China, the second largest economy, as their important partner, Song said. Even for the US, if Donald Trump wins a second term as US president, some US officials and scholars are worried that he may withdraw the US from the alliance, as he has accused NATO members of being ""delinquent"" in defense spending, according to Newsweek.  Even though NATO appears to be united through the Russia-Ukraine conflict, as NATO continues to expand, there will be more and more trouble and conflicts and the internal division will be expanded, analysts said, noting NATO was divided on whether to solve the Ukraine crisis through dialogue or keep fanning the flames and provoke Russia, and Turkey has been blocking Finland and Sweden from joining NATO. Analysts warned that the global expansion of NATO will make the alliance more fragmented, and the troubles may cripple the alliance.",CHINA,DIPLOMACY,Nato expansion.

""I am ready to provide mediation efforts for the peaceful settlement of disputes based on the will of countries in this region,"" Xue was quoted as saying on Monday by the US Post.Redwan Hussein, national security adviser to Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed, called for joint efforts at the conference to deal with the impact of conflicts, droughts and COVID-19, according to media reports. Others attending the conference were foreign ministers or deputies from Sudan, Somalia, South Sudan, Kenya, Uganda and Djibouti. Amid a series of old and emerging security perils, the countries in the HoA urgently need to find fresh conflict resolution approaches to ensure stability and peaceful socio-economic development. China stands ready to propose the ""Outlook on Peace and Development in the Horn of Africa"" to support regional countries in addressing security, development and governance challenges, China State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi said when visiting Kenya in early January.Although some West countries like the US also offer mediation efforts in the region, China has an advantage compared with them, which is that China never takes sides or interferes with regional countries' domestic affairs, according to He Wenping, director of the Africa Studies Section at the Institute of West Asia and Africa Studies under the China Academy of Social Sciences.China also stresses the importance of development as the key to solving security issues, which is in line with the demands of Africa countries amid the impact of COVID-19 pandemic, the Russia-Ukraine crisis and the crisis of food, finance and energy, which all have a serious impact on the economic and social development of emerging markets and developing countries, He told the Global Times on Tuesday.The 14th BRICS Summit will be held in virtual format in Beijing on June 23, under the theme of ""Foster High-quality BRICS Partnership, Usher in a New Era for Global Development.""When the main theme of peace and development has been seriously challenged by the US-led alliances, the summit will provide a platform for developing nations to build consensus on addressing acute development challenges, analysts said.China has remained Africa's largest trading partner for 12 consecutive years, during which period China created 18,562 jobs a year, according to a report by Swiss-Africa Business Circle released in February. According to the latest data released by the General Administration of Customs of China, total trade between China and Africa in 2021 reached $254.3 billion, up 35.3 percent, among which Africa exported $105.9 billion in goods to China, up 43.7 percent, the Xinhua News Agency reported.""Africa has seen development and progress in the past years, which is inseparable with China's help and cooperation,"" Wang Fei, a China business man in Guinea for about 10 years, told the Global Times. Wang said that in Guinea, the hydropower stations and electricity system constructed with the aid of China have forever changed the Africa country's history.

360,Harvest time for China’s aircraft carrier development through a century’s waves,Liu Xuanzun,2022-06-21,"On June 17, China launched its third aircraft carrier, the Fujian. The 80,000 ton-class heavy vessel is also the country's second domestically developed carrier and the first one in China equipped with electromagnetic catapults and arresting devices, greatly narrowing the technological gap with its US counterparts. The China People's Liberation Army (PLA) Navy had no aircraft carrier 10 years ago, and the launch of the Fujian reflects just how fast China's aircraft carrier program has developed and the big strides made by the PLA Navy.No aircraft carrier could come into being without a country's comprehensive national strength. The China people dreamed of aircraft carriers many decades ago, and China's aircraft carrier program was launched but later halted multiple times. With bitter, tearful stories from some of the country's well-known military officers, the country's achievement in aircraft carrier development today is a hard-earned victory.Realizing a dream Graphic: GTFor the first time in history, the US successfully experimented with aircraft takeoff and landing on cruisers in the early 1910s. Aircraft carrier also made an appearance in the First World War and transformed naval warfare into multidimensional undertaking. China was extremely weak at that time, but visionaries of the time understood the importance of this new, epoch-making weapon, according to China military experts.Chen Shaokuan, minister of the navy during the Republic of China era, was one of the first to suggest that China should have an aircraft carrier. He said in as early as 1932 that China should operate at least 20 aircraft carriers to safeguard the country from the Japan aggression. But this plan was impossible to realize, as purchasing these ships alone cost three times the annual financial revenue of the national government at that time, so Chen raised this idea only to highlight the importance of aircraft carriers to the government. In the War of Resistance against Japan Aggression (1931-45), all China warships, outdated even at their time, capsized.After the victory against the Japan invaders in 1945, Chen again planned to acquire 12 aircraft carriers in 30 years. But to Kuomintang Chairman Chiang Kai-shek who was in a hurry attempting to eliminate the Communist Party of China (CPC) in land combat, this plan was out of the question, not to mention China's shipbuilding industry at the time could only build hundred ton-class small vessels and had to rely on imports to get engines.After the founding of the China in 1949 and facing a maritime blockade from the world's superpower the US, the PLA Navy opted for a long-term development focus on land-based naval aviation, submarine, and fast boat forces given very limited defense budgets and the idea of maritime guerrilla warfare. As jet aircrafts began to board aircraft carriers in the 1950s, the technological requirements and cost needed to build an aircraft carrier skyrocketed, and only the US was able to operate this type of vessel. The Soviet Union only began to build such vessels in the 1970s.Under these straitened circumstances, Chairman Mao Zedong said at a meeting of the Central Military Commission (CMC) in June 1958 that China should build aircraft carriers and develop far sea fleets. The PLA Navy planned to build an aircraft carrier in the early 1960s. But the harsh reality on the ground at the time demonstrated that China's poverty and lack of technology could not be changed in a short time, and the plan to build 600,000 tons of warships was scrapped only a year after it was raised.In the 1970s, China's economic strength and subsequently its shipbuilding industry saw significant improvement, and overseas trade became increasingly important to the country's development, so safeguarding remote islands and sea lanes went on agendas. The PLA won the battle of the Xisha Islands with small boats against South Vietnam's large vessels in January 1974, but exposed its own weakness of lack of  aerial support. When the South Vietnamese regime fell in 1975, the PLA Navy failed to seize the opportunity to retrieve the six Nansha islets, and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam claimed so-called sovereignty over said islands in the China Sea. These missed opportunities showed that only naval strength can decide the actual control of remote islands, which compelled China to pay attention to the development of its maritime forces.Seriously ill, Mao still approved a plan to build 700,000 tons of warships for the PLA Navy in 1975, as leaders of the Navy, again, planned an aircraft carrier project, despite the lingering challenges in funding and technology. In 1978, then Central Military Commission Chairman Hua Guofeng approved the purchase from or joint building of an 18,000 ton-class light carrier with the UK for the PLA Navy, equipping it with UK Harrier vertical takeoff and landing fighter jets. In the early 1980s, China and the UK held negotiations over the project, but the quoted price from the UK was exorbitant for China, which soon shifted its focus to economic development, slashing defense spending and again canceling its aircraft carrier program.In 1980, when Liu Huaqing, the former vice chairman of the CMC, later dubbed father of China aircraft carriers, boarded a US aircraft carrier, he stood on his toes to get a better view of the US' technological advancements. This moment was caught on camera, and Liu's move in the hope of one day building an aircraft carrier of China's own later deeply moved the hearts of China people.But at that time, many people within China did not understand the importance of the navy, not to mention aircraft carriers. Liu instructed Zhang Zhaozhong, a retired military expert at the PLA National Defense University, who had conducted research on aircraft carriers for many years, to promote aircraft carriers to other departments, but this proposal was not well received, as there was not enough money available to build aircraft carriers.Zhang recalled in a TV program in 2017 that when he reported back to Liu on the situation, Liu sadly acknowledged that the idea of a China aircraft carrier was not supported by many, even among the China public. The military budgets for the PLA lagged behind those of the US, Russia, India, Japan, and even the island of Taiwan. The navy is a money-consuming military service, making it virtually impossible for PLA to build a proper frigate at the time, Zhang said.China's economic reality at the time could not support naval development, leading to a Vietnamese-led occupation of a number of China islands, Zhang said. China emerged victorious against Vietnam in the Chigua Reef Skirmish on March 14, 1988 in the Nansha Islands, but despite this victory, weaknesses were exposed in the lack of air support once again. At the time, China's southernmost airfield was 1,000 kilometers away from the Nansha Islands, while the country's fighter jets only possessed a 400-kilometer combat radius. After the skirmish, the PLA Navy again urged for the building of aircraft carriers. Liu, as naval chief, planned to conduct a pre-study of aircraft carriers from 1991 to 1995, and started development work in 2000. But China's economy was still not strong enough, and the defense budget in 1990 was only about $5 billion, ranking below the top 10 in the world, so the program was initially limited to only the pre-study phase.China purchased the decommissioned UK-made HMAS Melbourne light carrier from Australia in 1985, then acquired ex-Soviet carriers Minsk and Kiev. The studies on these carriers more or less contributed to China's aircraft carrier program, but it was the ex-Soviet carrier Varyag that was refitted into its first aircraft carrier by China As China embarked on its rapid economic growth period in the 1990s and the start of the 21st century, conditions were finally perfect for the increase of national defense investments. It has become a domestic consensus at this time that a major country with overseas interests must have aircraft carriers. The first China aircraft carrier, the Liaoning, at sea. Photo: VCGIn 1999, entrepreneur Xu Zengping purchased the unfinished Varyag from Ukraine. Because of US pressure on Turkey to stop the ship from leaving, the Varyag stayed in Ukraine for two more years until Turkey allowed it to pass through the Bosporus Strait in November 2001 after China's diplomatic efforts with Turkey. After a four-month voyage, the carrier arrived in Dalian, and Xu decided to hand it over to the PLA.It saved China a lot of time and cost to learn the construction of an aircraft carrier to refit one based on the Varyag than building one from scratch. The refitted carrier made its first sea trial voyage on August 10, 2011, and after a series of tests, it was renamed the Liaoning and commissioned for use by the PLA Navy on September 25, 2012, when China, for the first time, had an operational aircraft carrier.Backed by national strength A child salutes in front of the Liaoning and Shandong models at the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Center on July 3, 2021. Photo: ICAn aircraft carrier is a large and complex system that involves almost all industries including shipbuilding, electronics, engines, aviation, aerospace, and the sourcing of materials, and represents a country's overall technological and industrial capacities and comprehensive national strength, military experts told the Global Times.The Varyag came to China as practically an empty shell, and China rebirthed it as the Liaoning with full propulsion systems, weapons, electronics, and radars among others, plus carrier-based fighter jets. With accumulated experiences in refitting the Liaoning, China then independently designed and built the country's first domestically developed aircraft carrier and the second one overall, the Shandong, which is based on the Liaoning but with many improvements. It was launched on April 26, 2017 and entered PLA Navy service on December 17, 2019, as China entered a dual carrier era.But both the Liaoning and the Shandong are of an outdated Soviet configuration with a ski-jump ramp, and their combat capabilities trail behind those of US super carriers that use catapults. On June 17, 2022, the Fujian, China's third aircraft carrier, was launched, leaving the world in wonder, as China has now independently developed its own aircraft carrier that comes close to its US counterparts by having similar displacement and electromagnetic catapults. It is also expected that China will eventually develop even larger, nuclear-powered aircraft carriers. No country without a high comprehensive national strength can make these achievements, experts said.Looking back on the path China's aircraft carrier program has taken,  for those who dreamed of China aircraft carriers, devoted their lives to them, and did not live long enough to see their efforts come to fruition, China can now proudly remember and commemorate them with hard-earned achievements in the country's aircraft carrier development today.",IN-DEPTH,IN-DEPTH,"China's third aircraft carrier, the Fujian, is launched in Shanghai on June 17, 2022.

365,‘Economic Article V’ a blatant incitement to undermine security order of others,Ding Gang,2022-06-22,"Recently, two EU and US politicians presented NATO with a proposal called ""Economic Article V"" to counter the coercion of authoritarianism. One of these two politicians is former NATO secretary general Anders Fogh Rasmussen and the other is former US ambassador to NATO Ivo Darder. Because of their past positions, their proposals for NATO therefore have a certain political significance.However, those who read the memo carefully must feel that these two old-school politicians' understanding of the world order is likely still based on the era of West power dominance, and that the only order they define is their order.Once such an article becomes an obligation enforced by NATO members, it is in effect the equivalent of mob bosses encouraging their minions to bully people and dominate markets. Article V of the North Atlantic Treaty establishes the principle of ""collective defense,"" which means that whenever one or several NATO member states are attacked or invaded by an outside military force, it can be considered an attack or aggression against all member states, and the other members are obligated to help them fight back.There is a basic condition in this clause that other member states can provide military support only when a member state is attacked by an external enemy, not when that member state takes the initiative to invade or attack another country. That's why many member states opposed the US' war against Iraq in 2003.So, what is this NATO Economic Article 5 proposal? Simply put, it is turning military counterattacks into economic counterattacks, that is, when a member state is hit economically by an outside power, other member states are obligated to help it fight back.The two politicians believe that authoritarian states are increasingly using economic coercion against democracies. They cite economic coercion by China against Lithuania and Australia in recent years as a prominent example. Therefore, they suggest that NATO engage in economic Article 5 to counter authoritarian coercion.Obviously, the example cited in this proposal is a distortion of the facts, and the mentality of the West politicians who made this proposal is like that portrayed by a China proverb which says that to beat a dog is to bully its master.Why would China ""beat the dog?"" Lithuania crossed the red line of China's national sovereignty on the Taiwan question, which directly undermines China's core interests.They evaded the basic fact that Vilnius allowed the establishment of the ""Taiwan Representative Office"" instead of the ""China Taipei"" Representative Office. This is the first representative office under the name of ""Taiwan"" established by the Taiwanese authorities in an EU country, which seriously undermines the one-China principle recognized by EU foreign policy toward China.Lithuania is not unaware of the seriousness of this issue, nor is it necessary to set up a representative office with such a name to develop economic and trade relations with Taiwan, so it is not an economic and trade issue at all, but a matter of a political attack on China. The EU always boasts of a unified foreign policy, but it has not corrected this move of Lithuania, which has caused great damage to the political credibility of the EU. Now there is a proposal to create a NATO Economic Article V that would allow all NATO members to help Lithuania against China. This goes beyond the scope of NATO's prescribed military defense and is a blatant encouragement to member states to undermine the security order of other regions more recklessly.The recent outbreak of the Russia-Ukraine war has created a sense of ideological importance in the West, which on the one hand makes them appear more united, and on the other hand gives rise to a crazy hegemonic impulse. They are not only looking for excuses to do everything possible to make NATO an offensive military bloc, but also thinking of changing it into an instrument of war, which, in all seriousness, is dragging humanity into World War III.It is time to warn some West people who look like gentlemen but are actually gang leaders. The world today is no longer a place where West powers can drive around in their gunboats and flex muscles. If they try to provoke China's core interests, they are bound to face a counterattack. If their minions come to provoke, we will fight back; if the gang leader and the followers come together to make trouble, we will likewise fight back.The author is a senior editor with People's Daily, and currently a senior fellow with the Chongyang Institute for Financial Studies at Renmin University of China. dinggang@globaltimes.com.cn.

366,BRI aids decade-long African transformation: expert,GT staff reporters,2022-06-22,"Editor's Note: In 2013, China President Xi Jinping put forward the ""Belt and Road Initiative"" (BRI), aiming at building a new platform for international cooperation and creating new momentum for shared development. Since then, the BRI, along with other multilateral initiatives launched by China, have created impetus and stability for global development, with Africa being a vital component of the initiative that has helped tap the continent's growth potential. The Global Times (Global Times) spoke with Nicholas Dweh Nimley (Nimley), a researcher scholar on China-Africa strategic bilateral and multilateral cooperation who is also the chief editor of NEWCOM Television, sharing his view on how BRI has facilitated regional growth in the past decade.This is the first in a series scoping the views of foreign experts on the remarkable contribution made by the BRI and China - the world's second-largest economy - to global development over the past 10 years.Global Times：How do you evaluate the implementation of China-proposed Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) in Africa over the past 10 years?Nimley: BRI seeks to connect Asia with Africa and EU via land and maritime networks with the aim of improving regional integration, increasing trade and stimulating economic growth. The BRI cooperation has transformed the fate of the continent of Africa through infrastructure development, trade and created thousands of jobs for Africans.  It conveys a message of hope, and brings China closer to the people of Africa and boost cultural exchanges.   I think the BRI is giving Africa the development it needs and also establishing strong partnership through trade. Since the implementation of BRI, a large number of key cooperation projects between China and Africa are now up and running, delivering concrete benefits. In recent years, under the BRI, a number of transportation projects have been completed and opened to traffic, including the Addis Ababa-Djibouti Railway, the Mombasa-Nairobi Standard Gauge Railway in Kenya, and the first and second phases of the Nigeria Railway Modernization Project. Projects such as the Doraleh Multi-Purpose Port in Djibouti and the Lome Container Terminal in Togo have also been successful. These projects have played an important role in boosting regional connectivity and integration. Despite the impact of COVID-19, China has maintained its position as Africa's largest trade partner for 12 consecutive years. The direct investments in Africa from China remain steady. Over 1,100 cooperation projects keep running, contributing to the economic recovery of Africa. Moreover, China-Africa cooperation in new areas such as digital economy, aerospace, clean energy and new infrastructure are also scaling up. The friendly relations between the continent of Africa and China are gaining more trust on a daily basis. We all know that through BRI, China and Africa countries are equal in terms of decision making and no single country can dominate.  Africa sees China as a partner for development.Global Times: How do you evaluate the economic and trade cooperation between China and Africa countries, especially with Liberia, in recent years? Nimley: China and Africa countries have strong trade and economic cooperation, despite the pandemic. Both sides have been a major source of imports with an increase in bilateral trade in 2021 to have exceeded $250 billion, an increase of 35 percent from 2020. Some Africans have established enterprises in China, and China is also a major export destination for crude and beef products from Africa.The two sides have witnessed enhanced cooperation under the framework of the Asia Infrastructure Investment Bank, which is intended to promote infrastructure building and sustainable development. China also has carried out a zero-tariff treatment for 97 percent of goods from Africa Least Developed Countries, and has over the years welcomed the participation of Africa companies in China International Import Export and China Agricultural Trade Fair.Global Times: In what areas do you think China and Africa could strengthen cooperation in the future? Nimley: China and Africa could further strengthen cooperation in the future with regard to renewable energy. As we all know, China, being one of the leaders globally with regard to renewable energy, and a major driver of the production of solar lights and solar panels, will be a bigger player in helping the people of Africa to address its power (electricity) challenges. In order to make the sustainable development and climate goal a success story, the availability of renewable energy must be ensured. With China having the capacity and technical ""know-how"" in terms of production of renewable materials, Africa and China should deepen cooperation in making renewable energy available for all. Global Times: Foreign outlets have been smearing BRI and China's economic ties with Africa, calling it a ""debt trap,"" what is your view on such claim?Nimley: Foreign media's smearing against China-Africa trade and economic cooperation in my mind is about jealousy, to see a strong partnership that is bringing development you didn't expect. Despite this slandering, it is clear that what China is doing, and this is something the West countries failed to do for the people of Africa. Trade and economic cooperation is not a ""debt trap,"" instead, it is about giving Africa countries the kind of development they have long prayed for. China has never acted as a proselytizer, nor attached political strings; and it never interfered in domestic affairs of Africa countries nor imposed their will upon Africa.Global Times: What is your view on infrastructure initiatives proposed by West economies, such as the US' B3W initiative and EU's Global Gateway scheme?Nimley: China and Africa countries have already forged a stronger partnership through the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation. The US' B3W initiative and the EU's Global Gateway plans are already late upon arrival, because Africans already know the genuine purpose of the Europeans and the US. Africans know what they want, and they cannot be brainwashed by Europeans and US like in the past.There are no precondition clauses attached between China and Africa countries, instead mutual agreement in the spirit of coordination and cooperation is at the core. These levels of win-win cooperation are gradually transforming the face of the continent, building human resource capabilities and enhancing infrastructure deficit.Global Times: How should China and Africa join hands to tackle rising geopolitical tensions and other uncertainties?Nimley: The Russia-Ukraine conflict is affecting Africa countries greatly in terms of wheat acquisition, fertilizers and petrol. Most Africa countries look to Ukraine and Russia for wheat, fertilizers and petrol. And with this crisis, there has also been a hike in the prices of basic commodities including petrol because of the supply chain snags.China and Africa should face the geopolitical instability by deepening cooperation in all areas, especially agriculture and technology, knowledge sharing and transfer and infrastructure development. Africa needs the infrastructure and technology that will enable it to become an equal player at the table with the West, and to have these, China's partnership is needed.Global Times: After China and Liberia signed a maritime cooperation agreement, what results have been achieved by both sides?Nimley: Results that have been achieved by both sides include the ongoing promotion of maritime and port development, full and effective use of the fleets of the two countries to meet foreign trade demands, and safety of vessels, crew and cargo. Liberian flag vessels are receiving preferential rates for tonnage dues when visiting any port in China. The preferential rate savings equates to a 28 percent discount for each vessel's tonnage dues. This points to the effectiveness of the agreement.",SOURCE,ECONOMY,"A China-built expressway in Nairobi, Kenya, starts trial operation on May 15, 2022.

367,BRICS to lead global governance trend,Huang Renwei,2022-06-22," The BRICS countries, as a group of emerging economies, are very important when it comes to advancing global governance. From being followers to leaders, the BRICS' collective discourse power in the field of global governance has been growing.Two phenomena are worth mentioning at this year's BRICS Summit. First, this year, West developed countries have stepped up efforts to build a new exclusive multilateral mechanism, with the intention to sidestep the G20, exclude BRICS and reshape the West-led world order. BRICS members are encountering severe challenges. Second, in terms of the ongoing Ukraine crisis, except for Russia which is a party to the conflict, none of the other four BRICS members have followed the West in imposing sanctions on Russia. This indicates that the BRICS countries are forming the basis for consensus and common interests on major international events.Since the outbreak of the novel coronavirus pandemic, BRICS economies have been affected to varying degrees, which in turn has led to a partial fragmenting of global politics. A prominent example is India's participation in Quad Summit with the US, Japan, Australia as well as the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework. Even so, India has still resisted US pressure and maintained good relations with Russia. Can BRICS countries overcome challenges such as economic difficulties and political polarization, and continue to lead the trend of globalization and global governance? The answer is yes. The basic interests, values and rules of the BRICS countries are generally consistent, representing the direction of the international order, which is peace, development, cooperation, and win-win results. The current difficulties and challenges are partial, temporary, and surmountable.The common aspirations of the BRICS countries are to change the unreasonable status quo in the current global governance system, which contains the colonialist factors left over from history and the hegemonic phenomenon that exists in reality. The basic trend of BRICS countries participating in global economic governance is to carry out reforms while maintaining the stability of old governance mechanisms, and build a new governance mechanism according to new objective requirements. Compared with the closed and old-fashioned G7 mechanism, BRICS countries should reflect the direction and potential of future development and expand more space in the field of global governance.The construction of a new global governance system will be carried out across four levels: the UN system, the G20, BRICS Plus, and regional mechanisms. Among them, the UN system will transform from the post-World War II governance mechanism of great powers to the global governance system of the 21st century. Climate change and public health have become urgent governance issues. The G20, the main body of the global macroeconomic coordination mechanism jointly carried out by developed and emerging economies, was prominent during the 2008 financial crisis. In the face of new global inflation and supply chain problems, its institutionalization must continue to advance. ""BRICS Plus"" is the development and innovation of BRICS countries, and is a group of emerging powers that is establishing, adding new impetus to the reform of the global governance mechanism.The two blocs in the existing international landscape, namely, the group of West developed countries and the one of emerging countries, are not the two opposing camps formed during the Cold War, nor are the two closed groups. In the process of globalization and global governance, they have formed a complementary relationship. They cannot decouple from each other, nor can they take each other's place. The phenomenon of the two groups coexisting will become a long-term trend.It is long-term and urgent for the BRICS countries to enhance their discourse power in global governance. For example, the international monetary system is dominated by developed countries. The irrationality of such structure is evident. Worse still, hegemonic countries exploit their status in the international reserve currency and international settlement system to suppress emerging economies. These hegemonic countries puts their own economic interests and monetary policies above the interests of others. Either its deflation or inflation that will lead to disastrous consequences including financial crisis or asset bubbles to emerging and developing countries. The damage it triggers will be no less than a large-scale war. Even many developed countries cannot avoid the damage caused. Both the euro and the yen have been affected before. A similar situation remains in global governance mechanisms in other fields.No matter how big the obstacles and crises are, the BRICS countries will not stop striving to establish a more equitable and rational global governance environment. Maintain existing development momentum, seize the rare historical opportunity, and enhance the global governance capacity and share of voice. This year's BRICS summit will display the potential of a new future .The author is executive vice dean of Fudan Institute of Belt and Road & Global Governance. opinion@globaltimes.com.cn",OPINION,VIEWPOINT,BRICS Photo: CFP,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'BRICS': ('ORG', 12), 'G20': ('ORG', 1), '- Pacific Economic Framework': ('ORG', 1), 'BRIC': ('ORG', 1), 'UN': ('ORG', 1), 'BRICS Summit': ('MISC', 1), 'West': ('MISC', 3), 'Quad Summit': ('MISC', 1), 'Indo': ('MISC', 1), 'G': ('MISC', 2), 'Ukraine': ('LOC', 1), 'Russia': ('LOC', 3), 'India': ('LOC', 2), 'US': ('LOC', 2), 'Japan': ('LOC', 1), 'Australia': ('LOC', 1)}"
368,Genuine multipolar order advocated by BRICS allows greater levels of dialogue to address challenges: former S.African envoy,Hu Yuwei,2022-06-22,"Editor's Note: The 14th BRICS Summit will kick off on Thursday. The Summit will be held in virtual format under the theme of ""Foster High-quality BRICS Partnership, Usher in a New Era for Global Development."" When the world is plagued by a pandemic, hunger, war, and division among many others, the BRICS members and a big number of emerging markets and developing countries will jointly demonstrate to the world the BRICS spirit of ""openness, inclusiveness, and win-win cooperation."" On the occasion of the Summit, the Global Times interviewed Argentina's Ambassador to China Sabino Vaca Narvaja and Gert Grobler, a former senior South Africa diplomat, on the importance they attach to the multilateral mechanism.

BRICS states are bringing economic and political clout to international relations during a period when the old West-centric world system is under pressure to transform, and China is believed to be a linchpin in a much-needed economic dynamism and a key driver for inclusive global governance, Gert Grobler, a former senior South Africa diplomat, who served as an ambassador to Spain, Japan, and Madagascar, told the Global Times in a recent exclusive interview.The BRICS summit is taking place against the background of increasing challenges such as weak global leadership, dismal economic growth, unilateralism, and the fueling of geopolitical tensions which affect world peace and stability, he said. ""BRICS, however, has never had the intention to create an exclusive elite group but to jointly harness a common vision and its resources to benefit all its people through concrete mutual cooperation and to actually strengthen international cooperation toward a people-centered, better world.""Grobler has high expectations over the bloc, reiterating that ""the role of BRICS in the global governance system is destined to steadily increase as the countries have transformed a purely economic concept - BRICS - into a new and global governance institution.""""BRICS states bring economic and political clout to international relations during a period when the old West-centric world system is under pressure to transform,"" Grobler said.At the virtual meeting of BRICS ministers on May COVID-19, member states reiterated their commitment to enhancing and improving global governance by promoting a more agile, effective, efficient, representative, and accountable system; exercising inclusive consultation and collaboration for the benefit of all on the basis of respecting sovereignty, independence, territorial integrity, equality, and the legitimate interests and concerns of different countries.All this suggests that intra-BRICS cooperation is here to stay in the transition toward genuine multipolarity, not only economically but also militarily, and regarding agenda-setting capacity, said Grobler.BRICS is convinced that such a multipolar order will be far more democratic than any previous order in global history, allowing greater levels of genuine dialogue, a broader  distribution of knowledge, and more innovative and effective ways to address global challenges toward a better world, he said. Grobler said the BRICS summit is taking place against the background of an increasingly changing and uncertain world with problems and challenges such as weak leadership, inadequate economic growth, unilateralism, protectionism, hegemonism, power politics, and the fueling of geopolitical tensions that affect world peace and stability. ""Although these issues are all interlinked, the responses by the international community to these global challenges have sadly been woefully inadequate and fragmented,"" he said. China, as a valued and key BRICS member, has already concretely proven that it will actively continue to be a significant provider of much needed economic dynamism and act as a key driver for inclusive and just global governance, he believes. It is against this background of an ""uncertain world"" that the China-initiated concept of a common vision and dream to build a community of a shared future for mankind stands out.There is an already growing consensus among China, BRICS, and other international partners on future cooperation on all these constructive China initiatives.Grobler believes that BRICS will continue to provide support for improving global economic governance, promoting multilateralism, maintaining the multilateral trading system with the WTO as the cornerstone, improving the international financial and monetary system, and making economic globalization more open, inclusive, balanced, and beneficial for all.Skepticism and pessimism about BRICS have never stopped, such as the West's long-standing criticism of BRICS countries for not joining in their ""Russia-bashing"" campaign, or predicting a so-called ""sooner-or-later split"" among the members.""Contradicting all expectations of the eventual weakening of the bloc, BRICS member states continue to work in a committed fashion toward strengthening cooperation. BRICS not only continues to exist but has also started a process of institutionalization, leading to regular ministerial meetings in areas such as economy, finance, science and technology, education, health, security, and many others. Critics of BRICS who thought that its formation would be another talk shop, have been proven wrong. BRICS is a goal-oriented formation with continuity, concrete, and tactical actions,"" Grobler suggested.

Cape Town Photo: VCGBRICS' boundless potential Data shows that South Africa's bilateral trade has substantially grown, particularly in commodity and agricultural exports and manufactured goods imports, particularly with China and India. ""This is not surprising since China is the proverbial engine room of intra-BRICS trade,"" he suggested.Supported by funds from the National Development Bank, whose regional office is located in Johannesburg, South Africa has been a beneficiary of financing and technical support for major projects in combating the pandemic, transportation, clean energy, environmental protection, water infrastructure, and greenhouse gas emission reduction.Grobler said that South Africa and other BRICS countries have developed a deep respect and admiration for the profound changes in China under the leadership of the Communist Party of China (CPC).""It is no wonder that BRICS and many others regard China's development as an opportunity for the world rather than a threat,"" he said.With the growth rate of exports among them exceeding the global average since its inception, BRICS countries have made important contributions to promoting global economic recovery and high-quality development.According to official data, BRICS countries, together, represent about 42 percent of the global population, 24 percent of global GDP, 30 percent of the world's territory, and 18 percent of global trade. In recent years, BRICS countries have maintained a strong economic and trade cooperation momentum. With a combined market of $16.46 trillion, BRICS now forms almost 15 percent of the world's market capitalization of $112.43 trillion, according to Goldman Sachs.""Therefore the economic implications for BRICS from the Russia-Ukraine conflict and how to deal with unilateral sanctions imposed by the West against Russia, as well as cooperation among member states to combat COVID-19 pandemic will, amongst others, be key items on the agenda of the BRICS summit,"" said Grobler. Tangible benefits to South AfricaSouth Africa President Cyril Ramaphosa said on June 10 that his country wants to see ""a greater and deeper partnership"" with other BRICS members which is an attractive bloc that many other countries have confidence in. He especially spoke highly of the partnership between China and South Africa, saying China is ""a country [with] which we have a strategic relationship at the highest level.""South Africa joined the important bloc of emerging economies in December 2010, in line with the country's foreign policy to strengthen South-South cooperation, which Grobler called ""a milestone"" in South Africa to advance its national development priorities and to ""strengthen its activism on the global stage.""""Specifically, being part of BRICS enabled the country to employ additional and powerful tools in its fight to address its domestic triple challenges of unemployment, poverty, and inequality through increased trade, investment, tourism, capacity building, skills, and technology transfers, particularly to address its post-pandemic economic recovery,"" said Grobler.",IN-DEPTH,DIPLOMATIC CHANNEL,Gert Grobler Photo: VCG,"Reporter, Beijing","In-Depth reporter covering COVID-19 vaccines and health, Tibetan issue, China-ASEAN relations, among others.","{'BRICS Summit': ('MISC', 3), 'BRICS Partnership': ('MISC', 1), 'West': ('MISC', 2), 'BRICS': ('ORG', 9), 'Global Times': ('ORG', 2), 'G': ('ORG', 1), 'COVID': ('ORG', 1), 'Argentina': ('LOC', 1), 'China': ('LOC', 2), 'South Africa': ('LOC', 2), 'Spain': ('LOC', 1), 'Japan': ('LOC', 1), 'Madagascar': ('LOC', 1), 'Sabino Vaca Narvaja': ('PER', 1), 'Gert Grobler': ('PER', 3)}"
369,GT Voice: Double standards on Russian oil show ugliness of US policy,Global Times,2022-06-22,"At a White House press briefing on Tuesday, John Kirby, US National UN Coordinator for Strategic Communication, suggested that China's purchase of Russia oil is ""another example of a growing collaboration between China and Russia with respect to Ukraine."" However, when asked about India's purchase of Russia energy, he replied, ""There are sovereign decisions,"" while stressing that India is a ""very key strategic partner in the Indo-Pacific region.""The hypocrisy and double standards of the US cannot be clearer. Such remarks laid bare the US' complete disregard for other countries' sovereignty and norms of international relations and its selfishness that its own geopolitical goals must come first at all times and at all costs. The US avoids criticizing India over the latter's energy trade with Russia because US thinks India can serve its interests in the Indo-Pacific region, while painting China's normal trade with Russia as collusion because China is a perceived strategic competitor. Such is the ugliness of the US' foreign policy these days. But whatever the US' attitude is, it has no right to judge - let alone make decisions for - other countries, including China and India, over their trade ties with Russia or any other country. US's unilateral sanctions against Russia are not international law. Regardless of how the US and some of its allies promote them, the sanctions have not been approved by the UN or accepted by the broader international community.Even some US allies in EU that have joined in the sanctions have continued to purchase crude from Russia, although EU leaders have agreed to ban the majority of Russia oil imports. Last week, EU oil refineries took 1.84 million barrels a day of crude from Russia, the third consecutive weekly increase, according to Bloomberg.As for China and India, two of the world's most populous countries and fastest-growing developing nations, their decisions to continue energy trade with Russia is not only a sovereign right but is also based on the needs of their domestic social and economic development. Amid sky-rocketing global oil prices, it is only reasonable that China and India purchase fairly priced Russia oil. In this sense, regardless of the geopolitical lines drawn by the US to divide countries into friends and foes, many countries, including China, India and other emerging market economies, have common interests in safeguarding global trade against political disruptions. That is precisely why the broader international community has rejected or refused to join in US's unilateral sanctions against Russia. It is why an increasing number of emerging market economies have been eyeing on faire, safer global trade payment systems that are independent from the US dollar-dominated system as the US recklessly abuses its dominance. That is also why the BRICS summit has attracted so much attention, as many countries and businesses are pinning high hopes for the grouping of major emerging economies to come up with a better solution. What brings the BRICS countries together is the common development need to pursue a balanced approach in the current global economic order.In China, economic development is the top task. But the US has long regarded China's development as a threat, constantly imposing sanctions on China businesses and products with the aim of containing China's development. Since the beginning of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, the US has been making up lies to undermine China-Russia economic and trade ties - to put pressure on both countries regarded by US as its adversaries. But that has failed to disrupt China-Russia trade. In terms of energy trade with Russia, India has also been pursuing an independent approach. Despite West pressure over its energy trade with Russia, India has imported discounted Russia oil and tried to set up a bilateral payment and settlement system for its trade with Russia. There is no denying that there are differences among BRICS countries, but that doesn't prevent them from strengthening cooperation and making substantial progress in  trade and investment. It is an inevitable trend that common development need will always push developing countries to jointly address the problems facing them in the international economic order. And BRCIS can and should play a leading role in this trend.",SOURCE,GT VOICE,File Photo: CFP,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'White House': ('LOC', 1), 'US': ('LOC', 12), 'China': ('LOC', 8), 'Russia': ('LOC', 12), 'Ukraine': ('LOC', 1), 'India': ('LOC', 8), 'Indo': ('LOC', 2), 'Pacific': ('LOC', 2), 'John Kirby': ('PER', 1), 'UN': ('ORG', 2), 'EU': ('ORG', 3), 'Bloomberg': ('ORG', 1)}"
370,US building 'asymmetric capability' for Taiwan island pure 'daydreaming',Deng Xiaoci,2022-06-20,"The US is expected to start annual high-level military security talks, known as the ""Monterey Talks,"" with a delegation from the Taiwan authorities on Monday (US time). According to Japan media reports, US is expected to list about 20 weapons for sale to the island, with emphasis on building ""asymmetric capability.""  China analysts commented that it is very much daydreaming for the secessionist forces on the island to even think about containing the People's Liberation Army (PLA)'s military operations no matter what kind of US arms they obtain, as the so-called asymmetric weapons are ""useless"" when facing the PLA's absolute advantages.According to Nikkei, the US has prepared a military to-buy list for Taiwan authorities including anti-ship missiles, air defense and early warning systems. Taiwan-based media said that a delegation led by the head of the island's ""UN"" Wellington Koo would attend the ""Monterey Talks."" The event is normally attended by retired or active US military officers as well as representatives from the US Institute in Taiwan and arms dealers, experts told the Global Times previously.Some US officials and lawmakers said one lesson of the Ukraine crisis is that the US must help transform Taiwan into a ""porcupine"" to deter potential attacks from the China mainland, meaning that the island is suggested to buy large numbers of mobile, lethal weapons that are difficult to target and counter, rather than expensive, conventional platforms like the Abrams tanks, the New York Times reported. The HIMARS rocket system and ammunition with a range of 80 kilometers might be included in the list, which is designed to boost the island force to counter PLA landing operations, and weapons to complement the upgrade of F-16V fighter jets, and Harpoon anti-ship missiles and aerial torpedoes could be also listed for the same purpose, military expert Wei Dongxu told the Global Times on Monday. Wei pointed out that the weapons are not the most advanced ones, and   most of them are outdated US weapons gathering dust, and they will have limited help to build ""asymmetric capabilities."" Relying solely on the F-16v, an upgraded F-16, would never win Taiwan control of the air in a conflict against the PLA air force, Wei noted.The US is caught in an awkward place where it refuses to sell the more advanced F-35 stealth fighters to Taiwan, for fear the secessionist forces on the island would provoke the China mainland and lead to a conflict that US is reluctant to be involved in, he said.Military expert Song Zhongping said it is impossible for Taiwan to form ""asymmetric capabilities,"" no matter what kind of weapons it purchases from the US as the gap between the military capacities of the two sides is ""too huge.""For example, the purchase of anti-ship missiles, such as the Harpoon anti-ship missiles to intercept PLA warships, would turn out useless, as the missiles would be destroyed as soon as the conflict starts due to the lack of surviving capability, Song explained.""These missiles would pose no threat to the PLA as the PLA would hold complete control of the skies before an amphibious warfare bursts out between the two sides across the Taiwan Straits,"" Song explained.The US wants the island to build its own intelligence-gathering system and sells a lot of facilities to it. But no matter what system the island builds, it would be controlled by the US.   It is also unrealistic to boost the island's anti-submarine capability by simply buying a few submarines. The island has only a few of them that can be counted by a single hand, and the current Sea Dragon and Sea Leopard are too weak to form a real force for combat, Song added. The US is only after arms deals by constantly cooking up new concepts and making a profit by selling obsolete weapons, Song said. The US has acted faithlessly, keeps regressing from its commitments and the consensus it reached with China, and attempted to weaken and undermine the one-China principle and use Taiwan to contain China. This is a major threat to peace and stability across the Taiwan Straits, the China Foreign Ministry noted in the Reality Check: Falsehoods in US Perceptions of China released on Sunday.According to Reality Check, in the military field, the US has sold weapons at a larger scale and with enhanced capability including assault weapons such as anti-radiation missiles, heavy weight torpedoes, and F-16V fighter jets.

371,Multinationals keep expanding in Chinese market with nearly 100 projects signed at summit,Shen Weiduo,2022-06-20," China remains a strong force in global supply chains, despite temporary COVID-19 disruptions, intensified China-US competition and a reconstruction of the global division of labor, multinationals and industry representatives said at a major multinational summit on Monday.The discussion and remarks, which came from industry giants with global operations such as Foxconn and Lenovo, also offered the latest rebuttal to some foreign hype that a recent surge in exports from Vietnam was an indicator that supply chains are leaving China due to a loss of appeal. When it comes to the global division of labor and supply chain transfers, multinational corporations operating in China at different levels should have full confidence in China, Cui Zhicheng, chief commercial officer of the Foxconn Technology Group, said during a forum at the Qingdao Summit held in Qingdao, China's Shandong Province on Monday.Cui noted that China's strength in the global industry chain no longer relies on labor costs. The comprehensive strength and the comprehensive market environment are the areas where China has confidence and resilience. Multinationals' confidence in the world's second-largest economy is on vivid display at the Qingdao summit, which has attracted more than 5,000 participants both online and on-site, including representatives from 476 Fortune 500 companies and other industry leaders.A total of 99 key cooperation projects were signed during a ceremony on Monday. The total investment of contracted projects was $15.6 billion, with contracted foreign capital worth $5.31 billion from 16 countries and regions, including South Korea, Japan, the US, the UK and Singapore.The solid commitment comes amid complicated circumstances such as the rise of trade protectionism, the intensified competition between China and the US, COVID-19 pandemic and the Russia-Ukraine conflict, and a profound reshaping of the global supply chain.Participants noted that China's dominance, built up over the years, is very difficult to be shaken by any country, whether in terms of scale or scope.""When we are talking about the ICT industry chain, at present, China still has the most mature and advanced technological foundation and comprehensive strength. So at least for the foreseeable future, we believe that China still has an irreplaceable advantage in the area,"" Xu He, chief transformation officer of the global supply chain at Lenovo, told the Global Times at the sidelines of the forum on Monday.China's manufacturing value-added has ranked first in the world for 12 consecutive years, equivalent to the combined total of the US, Germany and Japan, and it holds an absolute advantage in the world that other countries such as India and Vietnam cannot surpass in the short term, according to a report drafted by the China Academy of International Trade and Economic Cooperation that was released during the summit.

But its huge domestic market, complete industrial supporting capability, continually improved innovation and constantly optimized business environment will boost China's new advantages in global supply chains gradually, which will help multinationals to achieve better development in China.In particular, high-tech manufacturing and high-tech services are now entering China, Zhang Yansheng, chief researcher of the China Center for International Economic Exchanges, told the Monday forum, adding that new opportunities for foreign firms are embedded in China's climate goal and opening-up strategies.Tao Lin, vice president at Tesla, said at the opening ceremony that Tesla's Shanghai plant contributed half of the company's global deliveries with output exceeding 480,000 electric vehicles in 2021. The plant has become Tesla's most important export base and production center, delivering high-level China manufacturing to the world.China's prospects in the digital economy and low-carbon development have brought broad development opportunities to US companies like Honeywell. Honeywell is optimistic about the opportunities brought by energy, aviation, construction, chemical and other industries to promote energy conservation, emissions reduction and sustainable development, Yu Feng, Honeywell's China president, told the Global Times on Monday.""It is also important to separate politics and economics. We do not engage in zero-sum games, take all, and politicize the economy. We put more emphasis on more cooperation and openness,"" Zhang said.Looking ahead, China will further relax market access, promote fair competition, continuously improve the level of trade and investment liberalization and facilitation, and strive to create a market-oriented, law-based and international business environment, Wang Wenbing, spokesperson of China's Foreign Ministry told a regular press conference on Monday.",SOURCE,COMPANIES,"A view of the Lujiazui area, a financial zone, in Shanghai Photo: VCG","Reporter, Beijing",Business reporter following China’s macro economy and global high-tech firms.,"{'China': ('LOC', 13), 'US': ('LOC', 3), 'Vietnam': ('LOC', 1), 'Qingdao': ('LOC', 2), 'Shandong Province': ('LOC', 1), 'South Korea': ('LOC', 1), 'Japan': ('LOC', 1), 'UK': ('LOC', 1), 'Singapore': ('LOC', 1), 'Russia': ('LOC', 1), 'Ukraine': ('LOC', 1), 'COVID - 19': ('MISC', 2), 'Qingdao Summit': ('MISC', 1), 'Fortune 500': ('MISC', 1), 'Foxconn': ('ORG', 1), 'Lenovo': ('ORG', 2), 'Foxconn Technology Group': ('ORG', 2), 'Cui Zhicheng': ('PER', 2), 'Xu': ('PER', 1)}"
372,International society should throw cold water on Japan’s foolhardiness: Global Times editorial,Global Times,2022-06-21,"The US and West public opinion has paid increasing attention to Japan's recent moves on defense. More and more analysts believe that Japan seems to have been completing the largest ""military"" transformation in recent decades. Some US media asked, ""Is Japan's military strong enough to subvert the military pattern in the Asia-Pacific?"" And some even reported that Japan is turning away from its post-World War II ""pacifism."" Regardless of the true intent of these reports, they have indeed raised an important issue that deserves the vigilance of regional countries.Over the past few decades, Japan has generally given the international community the impression of being ""low-key"" and ""restrained"" in the field of defense, but this does not mean the country is a ""Hello Kitty."" According to some US media outlets, Japan's well-trained and well-equipped Self-Defense Forces are now among the most powerful armed forces in the world. The Global Firepower Index (GPI) ranked Japan fifth globally in overall military power. In the global military strength rankings published by Japan media, Japan ranked fourth in the world.The outbreak of the Russia-Ukraine conflict has triggered the ""remilitarization"" ambition of the Japan right-wing forces. On Sunday, leaders of Japan's ruling and opposition parties including Prime Minister Fumio Kishida discussed on TV whether Japan should consider acquiring a nuclear-powered submarine. Not long ago, Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party proposed to increase the proportion of GDP for defense spending from 1 percent to 2 percent within five years. Japan has been propagating and emphasizing its ""unease."" This, in turn, also makes Japan's neighboring countries feel puzzled and uneasy. Japan, which has gradually shifted its national focus from economic development to military expansion, is becoming the biggest hidden danger to peace and stability in East Asia.In the process, US's indulgence has offered the Japan right-wing politicians unrealistic fantasies. In the face of Japan's move to seek a fundamental change in defense, Kurt Campbell, the White House's Indo-Pacific policy coordinator, did not express any concern. He described Japan as a ""responsible country,"" and said that ""memories of a distant period do not animate modern concerns."" What people see from this is that US is leaning over to untie the ropes that it once bundled up on Japan militarism. The utilitarian mentality of using Japan to build a containment circle against China has overwhelmed deserved US concerns on regional risks and consequences. Given the overall operations conducted by US, the real dangers of Japan right-wing forces are obscured. Japan is the only country in the world that dares to openly deny the history of its aggression in World War II, but the US has kept endorsing Japan's ambitions out of its own geopolitical self-interests. It hopes that Japan could keep the ability to bark at China frequently, even bite when necessary, while it takes Japan under its own control confidently. In other words, the US does not care if Japan is smashed to pieces in the geopolitical collision, while Japan wants to use the US' selfishness to achieve its purpose of completely unleashing its military and political restrictions, which has become a dangerous scheme of theirs.Currently, the entire Japan political arena tends to be not clear-headed. There are voices in almost every political party advocating the need to increase Japan's defense capabilities, as well as ""striking bases in enemy territory."" This scenario has never appeared since the end of World War II. Although the overall ideological trend of Japan society has changed a lot compared with the one before World War II, and the soil for reviving militarism is not sufficient, it can't be ignored that the possibility of using a crisis to provoke those extreme advocates to break through the social constraints. In particular, US is putting out the fire for Japan's ""remilitarization"" that threatens the world's public opinion, while at the same time giving Japan the initiative to stand at the forefront of US geopolitical competition.Regardless of what the US and Japan have said, what Japan is actually doing is rekindling the regional arms race and disrupting the peaceful and stable environment in the region. The scars of history remain vivid in people's minds, and the real danger is quietly approaching. Whether it is to prevent the resurgence of Japan militarism or to avoid the upspiral of regional security dilemmas, it is necessary for the international community to throw cold water on Japan's foolhardiness.",OPINION,EDITORIAL,"A Japan Self-Defense Forces soldier stands guard near a PAC-3 surface-to-air missile launcher unit (center), used to engage incoming ballistic missile threats, in position at the Defense Ministry in Tokyo on Monday.

But the bids have faced opposition from Turkey, which has been angered by what it says is Helsinki and Stockholm's support for Kurdish militants and arms embargoes on Ankara.Last week, Turkey said documents it received from Sweden and NATO in response to the earlier written demands it presented the two candidates were far from meeting its expectations and any negotiations must first address Turkey concerns. Speaking to reporters in Brussels alongside Deputy Foreign Minister Sedat Onal, Turkey presidential spokesperson Ibrahim Kalin said Ankara was expecting Sweden to take immediate steps regarding actions by the Kurdistan Workers Party militant group in its country.Any progress on the Nordic membership bids ""now depends on the direction and speed at which these countries will take steps,"" he said.The talks in Brussels with officials from Sweden, Finland, and NATO were held in an ""open and sincere atmosphere,"" he said. ""As we see these steps, we will all have the opportunity to evaluate the direction of this process.""Onal said Turkey expected a change of approach from Sweden and Finland, and Ankara needed ""binding promises"" to address its concerns.Reuters",WORLD,MID-EAST,"Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan (L, front) observes a military exercise in Izmir, Turkey, on June 9, 2022.

375,Collective voice of BRICS demands multilateralism,Fulufhelo Netswera,2022-06-21,"The year 2022 represents China's turn to host the BRICS Summit. It comes at a time when relations between the West and BRICS nations are at an all-time low, driven by unprecedented global volatility.First, there is an ongoing Ukraine-Russia war. Unfortunately, for the West, the US and its proxies (NATO) who could end the war at the negotiation table have chosen instead to continue arming Ukraine. The West media blames the war on Russia's aggression, but the rise of alternative media has shown a different reality. As stated numerous times, the end goal is to ""weaken"" Russia, unfortunately at an unimaginable cost to the global economy, and of Ukraine lives.Second, the US is stalking China in the China Sea. Many believe that US support for the Ukraine war serves as a warning to China over a possible military operation against Taiwan. Interestingly, this warning has recently been directly verbalized by US President Joe Biden who gave an assertive ""yes"" on intervening militarily if the China mainland takes the island of Taiwan by force. In response, China Foreign Minister Wang Yi warned the US against perpetuating its Cold War mentality after US Secretary of State Antony Blinken called China the most serious long-term challenge to the international order.The economic sanctions that the West has placed on Russia have so far backfired. The demand for Russia oil has reached records unseen for many years. As Russia demands payment in their local currency (ruble), the US dollar suffers and may cease to be the oil purchase standard (petrodollar) in the near future.It is pretty clear that the geopolitical hegemonic forces are quickly realigning. The intrusion into the China and Russia interests may have devastating consequences for the global economy, but importantly, may also speed up a worldwide geopolitical realignment. How these developments are managed may determine the future of major powers and perhaps the future of humanity itself.But in the interim, the consequences of this global jostling for political hegemony have been devastating. The global price of gas, oil, and food has skyrocketed to levels not seen in recent history including in the US itself. There are fears that if the situation is not quickly resolved then civil protests may overwhelm governments all over the world as stagflation erodes their purchasing power and drags down living standards. Tempers at the BRICS Academic Forums (May 20 2022) have never been this flared. Almost all presentations from BRICS nations spoke out against West aggression and specifically against US wards all over the world which are not sanctioned by the United Nation. Recommendations from BRICS countries do not seem as reconciliatory as the West had previously expected. This time around, the collective voice seems to be arguing for a multipolar - multilateral institutional setup in favor of BRICS and developing nations.There are recommendations for the escalation of the work being undertaken by the New Development Bank (NDB), possibilities of establishing a BRICS common currency and alternative financial instruments to the SWIFT system after Russia was expelled.There are talks of purchasing oil from OPEC nations with currencies other than the petrodollar. The US seems to be intent on persuading OPEC nations like Saudi Arabia not to join the petrodollar desertion. Given the all-time low in diplomatic relations between the US and Iran, it is not guaranteed that Tehran will be won over. Russia has called on BRICS countries to establish joint oil and gas refining facilities with Russia.What seems obvious both from the perspective of BRICS nations and the developing world is that West hegemonies have failed developing nations. If anything is to go by, the UN votes against Russia have demonstrated that much of the global South is unhappy with double standards that have come to define global affairs. Something has to change, and if change will not come peacefully then the entire world stands to suffer. The author is the Executive Dean of the Faculty of Management Sciences at the Durban University of Technology and a former director of the South Africa BRICS Think Tank. opinion@globaltimes.com.cn",OPINION,VIEWPOINT,BRICS Photo: VCG,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'China': ('LOC', 7), 'Ukraine': ('LOC', 4), 'Russia': ('LOC', 7), 'US': ('LOC', 8), 'China Sea': ('LOC', 8), 'Taiwan': ('LOC', 2), 'BRICS Summit': ('MISC', 2), 'West': ('MISC', 4), 'Cold War': ('MISC', 1), 'NATO': ('ORG', 1), 'BR': ('ORG', 1), 'Joe Biden': ('PER', 1), 'Wang Yi': ('PER', 1), 'Antony Blinken': ('PER', 1)}"
376,Japan embarks on dangerous path with revived constitutional change push,Deng Xiaoci,2022-06-21,"Japan has embarked on a dangerous path with a series of reckless domestic and foreign policies that are seriously threatening peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific and the world. The latest move sees Japan ramping up a campaign to push for the changes to its pacifist constitution at home apart from seeking to double its defense budget.  In terms of foreign policy, Tokyo has been keen on hyping the Ukraine crisis and the so-called ""China threat"" to support and advocate expansion of NATO in the Asia-Pacific, while constantly provoking China on its core interests.  Such a major shift in Japan's foreign and domestic policies that seek to revive its militarism past, which brought devastation to many in the Asia-Pacific, and to help bring the notorious, confrontation-oriented NATO to the region calls for vigilance among countries in the region, analysts noted.Ahead of Japan Prime Minister Fumio Kishida's attending the NATO summit next week in Madrid, Spain, which would mark the first Japan prime minister to have done so, the Number 2 man in the country's ruling Liberal Party (LDP) Toshimitsu Motegi revealed to media Monday that he wants to see parliament initiate the process of constitutional reforms after the July 10 House of Councilors election.The LDP's secretary general said that ""after the election, we want to as quickly as we can propose to the Diet constitutional revisions and have the proposed changes initiated,"" Japan's Kyoto News Agency reported on Monday. For any revision to Japan's postwar pacifist constitution to be initiated, approval by a two-thirds majority in both houses is required.Motegi's remarks were made under the provision that pro-amendment lawmakers including in the LDP, its junior coalition partner Komeito, the Japan Innovation Party and the Democratic Party for the People would secure two-thirds or more seats in upper house elections, according to the report. Article 9 of the Constitution renounces Japan's ability to wage war and forbids it from maintaining ""land, sea, and air forces, as well as other war potential."" Since its promulgation in 1946, the Constitution has never been amended. To do so, more than two-thirds of lawmakers in both the upper house and the House of Representatives must vote in favor of the proposals. The changes would then need approval from a majority of voters in a national referendum.Japan's former prime minister Shinzo Abe, who served from 2006 to 2007, and again from 2012 to 2020, had aimed to revise the supreme charter during his tenure. He had called for clarifying the legal status of the country's Self-Defense Forces (SDF) by explicitly mentioning it in the Constitution to end arguments that the SDF are unconstitutional.If the constitutional amendment succeeds in the future, Japan is likely to get rid of the constraint of the pacifist constitution, can participate in wars overseas and join the aggressive multilateral organization NATO, and seek to develop into a military power, which will be very harmful to Japan, the Asia-Pacific region and the world, Liu Jiangyong, vice dean of the Institute of Modern International Relations at Tsinghua University, told the Global Times on Tuesday.The ""remilitarization"" ambition of the Japan right-wing forces has also been revived following the outbreak of Russia-Ukraine conflict. On Sunday, leaders of Japan's ruling and opposition parties including Prime Minister Fumio Kishida discussed on TV whether Japan should consider acquiring a nuclear-powered submarine.  Kishida, who heads the ruling LDP, stressed the need to reinforce Japan's defenses at a time when Russia's military operation in Ukraine and ""China military assertiveness"" have highlighted Japan's security challenges. The ruling LDP panel on national security also advised in April 2022 the Kishida administration to not only increase its defense spending to 2 percent of Japan's GDP, but also to seek enemy-base strike capability, claiming to be ways to respond to the rising threat from China, North Korea and Russia. Japan is committed to an exclusively defense-oriented policy under the pacifist constitution, and its defense spending has been limited to around 1 percent of GDP. Even so, Japan's military spending is seventh in the world, according to media. The Global Firepower Index (GPI) ranked Japan fifth globally in overall military power. In the global military strength rankings published by Japan media, Japan ranked fourth in the world.It is not sensible for Japan to significantly increase defense spending when its economy is stagnant and its GDP contracted, Liu pointed out, noting the pursuit of military expansion and war preparation in violation of national interests is outrageous. In a set of April draft proposals as part of Japan government's revision of the National Security Strategy, or the long-term guideline, and two other key documents on defense, a national security panel of the ruling LDP sought to use stronger wording in describing China as security threat, together with Russia and North Korea, Kyodo reported. Liu noted this was the first time since World War II that Japan has taken such strategic positioning toward its neighbors.  ""This is a blatant provocation, taking China as a main threat and changing the direction of Japan's national policy. It is very dangerous,"" Liu warned.The push for a constitutional amendment by the LDP has sparked wide opposition in Japan. On Monday, an assembly to oppose the amendment of Article 9 was held at a hall of the House of Representatives in Tokyo. The attendees included local residents, scholars, journalists, professors and artists. The assembly was opposed to the Japan government using the Russia-Ukraine conflict as an excuse to strengthen Japan's defense ability, Japan media outlet Tokyo Shimbun reported on Monday.""The only way to maintain peace in Japan is to hold the Article 9 high,"" said the organizer of the assembly. Another attendee said increasing the military budget would decrease the spending on social welfare, nursing and education which are closely related to the people's livelihood in Japan, according to the report.The devaluation of the yen and rising prices have prompted increasing complaints from the Japan public over the current administration, and against this backdrop, it is not easy for the LDP and other pro-constitution amendment forces to gain a landslide victory in the July 10 House of Councilors election, Liu said.Going against timesThe Yomiuri Shimbun also reported Tuesday that Kishida is mulling meeting with South Korea President Yoon Suk-yeol, Australia Prime Minister Anthony Albanese and New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern on the sideline of the NATO summit, and said that the leaders are expected to express their unity in ""opposing unilateral attempts to change the status quo in the East and China Seas, with Beijing in mind.""According to Nihon Keizai Shimbun, Kishida will call on heads of state at the NATO summit to turn their attention to Asia, declaring that Japan will ""fundamentally reinforce Japan's defense capabilities within the next five years,"" and promote the Japan-US alliance to a higher level.Kazuyuki Hamada, the President of Research Institute for Future Technologies, and former Parliamentary Vice Minister for Foreign Affairs, told the Global Times in an exclusive interview that Kishida seems to be consolidating his stance that a ""expanded NATO"" is indispensable, and it is against the times to propose a ""global NATO"" that will lead to a new cold war or hot war.""Japan's advocacy of 'Asia NATO' or 'global NATO,' and the realization of it, is nothing more than going against the post-Cold War era."" Hamada said. ""This unnecessarily intensifies the arms race and reduces the value of diplomacy."" The issue of providing support to Pacific island nations over which China is increasing its influence is also expected to be on the agenda, according to the Yomiuri Shimbun report. Liu warned that the summit consisted of the NATO members plus the four countries from the Asia-Pacific region could be institutionalized, which means the aggressive alliance between the US, EU countries and Japan began to take shape, weaving the military net against China.Da Zhigang, director of the Institute of Northeast Asia Studies at Heilongjiang Provincial Academy of Social Sciences, pointed out the ""backscratching"" relationship between the US and Japan in the Asia-Pacific region. The US has been indulging Japan's ambitions of getting rid of bondage of military development under the current Japan constitution as the US hopes Japan can contain China in the Asia-Pacific region, Da said.  Japan is trying to use the confrontation between China and the US to achieve its purpose of completely unleashing its military and political restrictions, Da said.Japan believes that the strategic contradictions between China and the US are irreconcilable, and it wants to take advantage of this opportunity to try to revise the constitution and forge an international violent multilateral alliance with introducing the strength of NATO to the region, Liu said.",CHINA,DIPLOMACY,"Protesters gather at Shiba Park in Tokyo, Japan, May 22, 2022.

377,Central Asia-China cooperation crucial to regional security and development: Kazakh ambassador (exclusive full interview),Global Times,2022-06-21,"Editor's Note: This year marks the 30th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Kazakhstan. China was one of the first countries to recognize the independence of Kazakhstan in January 1992, and China-Kazakhstan relations have withstood the tests of time over the past 30 years, with the two sides having established a permanent, comprehensive, strategic partnership. As key member states in the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO), China and Kazakhstan look forward to cooperating in ensuring regional security, fighting against terrorism, separatism, and extremism, and in enhancing economic coordination under the China-proposed Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) amid the current uncertainty being seen in the global supply chains. In his first exclusive interview since embarking on his second term as ambassador of Kazakhstan to China with the Global Times (Global Times) reporter Sun Haoran, Shakhrat Nuryshev (Nuryshev) said that Kazakhstan highly appreciates the level of Kazakh-China strategic partnership which is considered a benchmark of interstate relations with great stability enough to weather any challenges.Global Times: China State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi paid a visit to Kazakhstan between June 6 to 9, during which he said China and Kazakhstan have agreed to jointly build bilateral relations in the ""next golden 30 years"". What is your evaluation of China-Kazakhstan relations in the past 30 years, and what are your expectations for their cooperation in the future?  Nuryshev: First of all, let me thank the Global Times' editors for this interview. I'm so pleased, having become the Ambassador of Kazakhstan to China for the second time, to share with you my vision of the development of Kazakh-China cooperation in the new era.As you've noted, the current year in bilateral relations has been marked by a landmark event - the 30th anniversary of diplomatic relations between Kazakhstan and China. After China became one of the first to recognize the independence of Kazakhstan on January 3, 1992, our countries then established diplomatic relations. Since then, a new page was turned in the history of Kazakhstan-China cooperation. Kazakhstan highly appreciates the level of Kazakh-China strategic partnership which has been achieved over three decades, which can justifiably be called a benchmark of interstate relations with great stability against any challenges.By historical standards, this is certainly not such a long period, however, political trust and business partnership between Kazakhstan and China have reached a very high level. Our countries have no unsettled issues and no political discord. This factor creates favorable conditions for the dynamic development of trade and economic relations. Trade turnover between our countries has increased 70-fold over a 30-year period, which amounts to more than $25 billion, according to China's customs statistics. And this is not the limit, there are huge opportunities for increased bilateral trade. Now, for these purposes, our countries are actively cooperating in search of new opportunities to develop cooperation amidst the coronavirus pandemic and other global challenges. Kazakhstan is interested in enhancing bilateral cooperation, and in building mutual trust, friendship, and good neighborliness with China. An active political dialogue at a high level always characterizes our cooperation, and this year, despite the ongoing pandemic, the degree of dialogue is reaching previous, pre-pandemic levels.From this perspective, the ""diplomacy of the heads of state"" and the close personal relations of the leaders of our countries play a special role. In January this year, the heads of state held a virtual meeting, after which they held offline talks in Beijing as part of the grandiose Beijing Winter Olympic Games.A lot of agreements, the practical implementation of which is contingent on the foreign services of the two countries, have been reached. In this regard, the recent visit of member of the State Council, the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the China, Mr. Wang Yi was very symbolic to have been made during this period of time.The visit once again demonstrated the high level of bilateral relations and the steadfastness of the principles they are built on - good neighborliness, friendship, and mutual benefit. Views have been thoroughly exchanged on the entire wide-ranging cooperation. The parties have made progress in addressing issues of ensuring regional security, increasing trade, and in developing economic, investment, transport, and humanitarian cooperation.Practical agreements reached on the gradual resumption of regular flights between the two countries, and the issuance of visas to citizens of both countries, including for students.We believe that a possible visit by China President Xi Jinping to Kazakhstan can give a new powerful impetus to the Kazakh-China eternal comprehensive strategic partnership. Therefore, we very much hope that the coronavirus disease pandemic will end as soon as possible and the citizens of our two countries, including the heads of state, will be able, as before, to travel freely, paying visits to each other, and strengthen friendship and good neighborliness.Global Times: As a key member state of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO), Kazakhstan is to host the third China + Central Asia (C+C5) foreign ministers meeting in 2022. What is Kazakhstan's role in promoting relations between China and Central Asia countries? Nuryshev: Being in the very heart of the Eurasian continent, Kazakhstan is interested in strengthening comprehensive and mutually beneficial cooperation with the countries of Central Asia and China.Kazakhstan's multifaceted foreign policy is aimed at eliminating the rivalry of global powers in our region, and at creating powerful synergies through meaningful cooperation with all partners.This was starkly illustrated by the results of the virtual summit of the heads of states of Central Asia and China on the occasion of the 30th anniversary of the established diplomatic relations in January 2022 and the third ""Central Asia - China"" Foreign Ministers meeting recently held in Nur-Sultan.I would like to emphasize that in just two years the Central Asia-China dialogue has proven to be one of the most effective and promising platforms for comprehensive cooperation, capable of strengthening the atmosphere of trust, neighborliness, and the constructive search for mutually acceptable approaches to addressing urgent regional and international challenges.   In practical terms, agreements under the scope of the format have been reached to coordinate anti-COVID-19 pandemic efforts, jointly ensure regional security, protect digital data, and upgrade regional transport connectivity.I see a huge potential for Central Asia-China cooperation, I believe it is important to actively use it in order to accelerate the development of intra-regional trade and economic processes, which will allow the region to become one of the core and dynamic growth centers.Actually, this is what the ""Roadmap for the Implementation of the Initiatives of the Heads of State of Central Asia and China"" adopted in Nur-Sultan on June 8, 2022, is focuses on. The document should be an adequate response to the request to expand win-win relations between China and the Central Asia countries for the benefit of the peoples of our countries.Global Times: Wang Yi said the two countries are deeply concerned about the serious negative spillover impact of the Ukraine crisis, and hope that Central Asia countries can stay focused and eliminate external interference and strengthen coordination. How can China and Kazakhstan cooperate to safeguard regional peace and stability?Nuryshev: I would like to emphasize that this military conflict between two countries close to US resonates with pain in the hearts of the people of Kazakhstan.Kazakhstan has historically established close political, economic, cultural, and people-to-people ties with Russia. Having the longest border in the world, we intend to maintain the established level of trade and economic cooperation with Russia partners. In general, our states are allies legally and politically, and are strategic partners. We are also interested in the early recovery of the high dynamics of broad mutually beneficial cooperation with Ukraine. Therefore, we sincerely believe that Moscow and Kiev will find a way to bridge their differences peacefully in the near future.We always take the attitude of the need to keep the dialogue going even in the most difficult of situations. As it is known, President of Kazakhstan, K. Tokayev, had a telephone conversation with the presidents of both Russia and Ukraine, arguing both parties to find peaceful ways to resolve the conflict. Kazakhstan gives every assistance in peacekeeping efforts to finding ways to end the armed stand-off, address humanitarian problems, and ease tensions in international relations.Here I would like to note that the use of any economic or political sanctions historically is not the most effective way to settle international disputes and conflicts. Therefore, Kazakhstan does not intend to join the sanctions pressure against any country and take actions that would be contrary to the sense of dialogue.In that regard, I believe that, in order to protect our own national interests, it is necessary to make every effort to prevent these sanctions from having a serious impact on the development of our economies and the well-being of their peoples.Global Times: In terms of external interference, especially by US-led forces that aim to force Central Asia nations to pick sides, what is Kazakhstan's position on this issue? Nuryshev: In responding to this question, I would like to immediately draw attention to the fact that:Firstly, the Republic of Kazakhstan is an independent, democratic, and legal state. It determines and pursues both domestic and foreign policy autonomously, building its relations with all states on the principles of international law.Secondly, over the years of the country's independence, our country has reinforced its international standing, establishing itself as a peace-loving and open state, and a reliable global and regional partner. Kazakhstan implements a multi-faceted, pragmatic and proactive foreign policy, making a significant contribution to the formation and implementation of the global and regional security, cooperation, and development agenda.Therefore, when making decisions, we primarily proceed from national interests and goals for the meaningful promotion of foreign policy and foreign economic priorities.Global Times: China and Kazakhstan are actively promoting cooperation in the field of regional security both at the bilateral level and as part of the SCO and CICA. How do you assess the cooperation between the two countries in this area? How important is the security and stability support in Central Asia?Nuryshev: Today, in the current context of international relations, the role of Central Asia is increasingly strengthening. The region holds a strategically important position in the Eurasian continent. The security of a number of neighboring countries depends on the stability and development of Central Asia. Therefore, Central Asia claims greater attention from world powers, especially in the wake of settling the problems of regional security and socio-economic development. China, neighboring Central Asia countries, as a regular member of the UN and one of the active participants in such regional mechanisms as the SCO, CICA (Conference on Interaction and Confidence Building Measures in Asia), and the 'CA-PRC' (Central Asia - China) format, plays an important role in supporting stability and security in the region.In practical terms, within all these mechanisms, there is close cooperation, especially in the fight against the so-called ""forces of the three evils"" - terrorism, separatism, and extremism. For example, in the SCO Regional Anti-Terrorist Structure, the competent authorities of member states have been successfully counteracting the spread of destructive forces in the Organization's area of responsibility for a long period of time. In turn, the SCO's three-level mechanism for fighting against drug crime is effectively working to block channels of financing terrorism and drug trafficking. Even the military component of the SCO has a strong antiterrorist focus.Within this framework, I also would like to focus on the significant opportunities of the Conference on Interaction and Confidence Building Measures in Asia. CICA has the necessary potential and matured experience to develop common confidence-building measures to fight against current challenges and threats in Asia.Currently, Kazakhstan chairs CICA and promotes a number of initiatives so that the Conference plays an increasingly significant role in ensuring security and development in the region.One of the main initiatives by Kazakhstan is the idea of transforming CICA into a fully-fledged international organization. This will propel our collective efforts to counter current challenges and threats to a qualitatively new level.We are grateful to the China side for its strong support of CICA's activities and significant contribution to the promotion of the Kazakh initiative to transform the Conference into a fully-fledged international organization.Global Times: Kazakh President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev presented the ""New Kazakhstan"" economic policy in May, saying that Kazakhstan is an important and reliable partner for the China-proposed Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). Could you specify the fields in which China and Kazakhstan can coordinate under the framework?Nuryshev: Yes, indeed, in a recent Address to the people of Kazakhstan, the President of the Republic of Kazakhstan, K. Tokayev, has brought forward a large-scale program of political modernization of the country with the main goal of a comprehensive transformation of the entire state model of development. Kazakhstan is undergoing a transition from a ""super-presidential"" government to a presidential republic with an influential parliament and an accountable government. These political reforms are being carried out on the sidelines of comprehensive economic reforms aimed at building a genuine market, free and competitive economy.Amid a quite stressful international situation, the disruption of global supply chains, trade wars, and unprecedented inflationary pressure have become a fact of life these days. In such a climate, states and businesses need to quickly adapt to the new rules of the game so as to maintain their competitiveness.The path to success here may be the expansion of trade and togetherness. China's BRI is well-timed in this regard. The initiative, in my opinion, has opened new doors for various states. The implementation of joint projects has enabled the dealing of such issues as the construction of new infrastructure facilities and industrial enterprises, the involvement of advanced technologies, and the creation of new jobs.Actually, Kazakhstan, in the early 1990s, advocated for the Great Silk Road to be restored, and we did not hesitate to respond to the proposal by China President Xi Jinping on the construction of the Silk Road Economic Belt, which was an important part of the BRI. By the way, 2023 marks exactly 10 years since the moment when, in September 2013, China leader, Xi Jinping, presented this initiative in Kazakhstan for the first time.Since then, new, ample opportunities have opened up for industrial and investment cooperation between Kazakhstan and China. Especially for these purposes, in 2014 we launched a joint program and created a mechanism for coordinating work in this field. Thanks to this, China has been among the five largest investors in Kazakhstan in recent years in terms of raised foreign direct investment.Among the promising areas of cooperation with China, the development of the following fields is important: Logistics and transport as part of the integration of the development strategies of Kazakhstan and China; e-commerce and the expansion of the participation of Kazakhstani companies in China electronic platforms; trade in environmentally friendly agricultural products; the strengthening of scientific exchanges and the expansion of contacts in the field of high technologies; further development of cooperation in industry and investment; the use of renewable and water energy, having consideration to be the focus of the decarbonization of the economy; the strengthening of the dialogue on cultures, and the intensifying of educational exchanges.Moreover, it has to be said that the coronavirus disease pandemic, in general, has become a catalyst for the development of digital and IT technologies, ""smart"" solutions, more broadly so-called ""new infrastructure"", covering both material supplies and virtual supplies. We should take into account the successes and achievements of China in technological development and boost cooperation in this field.Global Times: Some people in Kazakhstan have concerns about China's investment in the country, and some worry that growing anti-China sentiment may challenge the relationship between the two countries. What do you think China and Kazakhstan can do to alleviate people's distrust toward China investment?Nuryshev: I agree that in recent years there has been growing criticism of China investment by some experts. Some conclude that the goal of the BRI is to establish China's dominance. It should be recognized that groups expressing such an opinion exist not only in our country, but also other foreign countries.It is natural, that the dynamically developing China BRI is perceived critically in many large states, and its scale, covering not just one region, but different continents, gives rise to concerns. At the same time, I believe that the accession of more than 180 countries of the world to the BRI is an indicator of the interest of the global community in it.It has to be noted that raising foreign investment and involving advanced technologies plays an important role in the growth of the national economy. This is the law of the market economy. China investment has become a global trend and a symbol of ensuring the healthy economic development of various countries around the world, including EU, Asia, Africa, and Latin US. The governments and business community of many states welcome the extension of financial cooperation with Beijing. In turn, China companies carefully and selectively choose partners who guarantee the safety and mutual effectiveness of investments. Kazakhstan is one such state.I am sure that the negative arguments regarding China investment will gradually decrease. This will be facilitated by the mutually beneficial implementation of investment projects, the social obligations of investors, as well as the production of a quality product from the cooperation of entrepreneurs who prioritize the welfare of the people and the prosperity of their state.I thank the Global Times editors for the initiative and the opportunity to share with a wide audience of readers of your newspaper opinions on the current situation and prospects for the development of Kazakh-China cooperation.

378,Reality Check: Falsehoods in US Perceptions of China,fmprc.gov.cn,2022-06-19,"IntroductionUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken has recently delivered a speech at Asia Society outlining the US administration’s approach to China. With carefully calibrated language, he sought to promote the “China threat” narrative, interfere in China’s internal affairs, and smear China’s domestic and foreign policy, all in an attempt at full-blown containment and suppression of China.

China US Illustration: Liu Rui/Global Times In what is to follow, we will use facts and figures to show to the world how deceptive, hypocritical and dangerous the US’s China policy is.Falsehood 1: China poses the most serious long-term challenge to the international order and is undermining it. The US will defend the international law, agreements, principles, and institutions that maintain peace and security, and protect the rights of individuals and sovereign nations.Reality Check: What the US has constantly vowed to preserve is a so-called international order designed to serve the US’s own interests and perpetuate its hegemony. The US itself is the largest source of disruption to the actual world order.◆ China has been and always will be a defender of the international order. China is a founding member of the UN (UN) and the first country to put its signature on the UN Charter. China is committed to upholding the UN-centered international system, the international order underpinned by international law, and the basic norms governing international relations built on the purposes and principles of the UN Charter. The Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence jointly championed by China, India and Myanmar have been widely recognized by the international community and have become the basic norms guiding state-to-state relations.China upholds true multilateralism and global strategic stability. China is the largest contributor of peacekeepers among the permanent members of the UN and the second largest contributor among all countries to the UN peacekeeping budget. China has taken an active part in international arms control, disarmament and non-proliferation processes. It has signed or acceded to more than 20 multilateral arms control, disarmament and non-proliferation treaties, including the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) and the Arms Trade Treaty (ATT). China is against arms race.In the wake of the international financial crisis of 2008, China adopted a responsible macro policy, remained a “stabilizer” for the world economy and made important contribution to global recovery. China actively provides international public goods to various countries, and has signed BRI cooperation agreements with 149 countries and 32 international organizations.◆ In recent years, President Xi Jinping’s vision of building a community with a shared future for mankind has been warmly received by the international community. It has been written into multiple important documents issued by the UN, the Shanghai Cooperation Organization and other multilateral institutions. UN Secretary-General António Guterres hailed China as an important pillar for multilateralism, noting that the purpose for practicing multilateralism is to build a community with a shared future for mankind. Peter Thomson, president of the 71st Session of the UN, said the vision of building a community with a shared future for mankind advocated by China is the only future for humanity on this planet. In response to various new global challenges, President Xi Jinping put forward the Global Development Initiative (GDI) and the Global Security Initiative (GSI). They represent China’s proposals for making the global governance system fairer and more equitable, and have received positive response and wide support from the international community.◆ The US has blatantly violated the purposes and principles of the UN Charter and the norms governing international relations. With its military might, the US has launched wars in numerous parts of the world, stoking divisions and conflicts and bringing huge turmoil and disaster to the world. Throughout the 240-plus-year history of the US, there were only 16 years in which the US was not at war. The US might as well be called the most belligerent country in the history of the world. US magazine The National Interest quoted Dakota Wood, senior research fellow for defense programs at the Heritage Foundation, who wrote that the US consistently needed to deploy military force every 15 years or so.Since the end of World War II, the US has either launched or participated in many wars overseas, including the Korean War, the Vietnam War, the Afghan War and the Iraq War. Those wars caused extremely severe civilian casualties and property losses, and lead to colossal humanitarian disasters. Since 2001, US wars and military operations in the name of counterterrorism have killed more than 900,000 people, about 335,000 of whom were civilians, injured millions and displaced tens of millions.◆ The US habitually puts its domestic law above the international law, and selectively applies international rules as it sees fit. Since the 1980s, the US had once withdrawn from 17 international organizations and treaties, including the UN Human Rights Council (UNHRC), the World Health Organization (WHO), the UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), the Paris Agreement, the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), the Arms Trade Treaty (ATT), the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty and the Treaty on Open Skies.Although the current US administration declared that “US is back” and the US has rejoined some international organizations and agreements, the administration has in essence not abandoned the “US First” policy, and is advancing “selective multilateralism”. The current administration has stayed out of institutions and agreements considered harmful to US interests such as the Treaty on Open Skies. EU media have described it as “US First 2.0”.◆ The US has abused its financial hegemony and technological clout and engaged in economic coercion in the name of protecting national security. The US has enacted some domestic laws, such as the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act and the Countering US’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act, and issued a series of executive orders to target and sanction specific countries, entities or individuals. The ambiguous rules contained in these acts and executive orders, such as the “minimum contacts principle” and “doctrine of effects”, are a willful expansion of the jurisdiction of US domestic laws. The US also abuses its domestic channels of prosecution to exercise long-arm jurisdiction over entities and individuals in other countries.For more than 60 years, in total disregard of the many resolutions of the UN, the US has continued its comprehensive blockade against Cuba based on its embargo policies and domestic laws such as the Torricelli Act and the Helms-Burton Act. The Cuba blockade is the longest and cruelest systemic trade embargo, economic blockade and financial sanctions in modern history. The blockade has been gravely detrimental to Cuba’s economic and social development, causing over 100 billion US dollars of direct losses to Cuba’s economy.The US has carried out blockade and sanctions against Iran since late 1970s. In May 2018, the US government announced its unilateral withdrawal from the JCPOA, and soon after resumed and expanded sanctions against Iran. Many countries and relevant entities have been forced to give up their cooperation with Iran. A large number of foreign oil enterprises left the country. Iran’s manufacturing industry can hardly sustain normal operation. The country has suffered economic slowdown, coupled with heightened inflation and massive currency depreciation.The US has imposed unilateral sanctions on Belarus, Syria and Zimbabwe, among others, over the years, and ratcheted up “maximum pressure” against the DPRK, Venezuela, etc.◆ Statistics show that the previous US administration had imposed over 3,900 sanction measures, which means it wielded its “big stick” three times a day on average. As of fiscal year 2021, the entities and individuals on US sanction lists topped 9,421, which was 933 percent higher compared to the fiscal year 2000.The US’s illegal unilateral sanctions and long-arm jurisdiction have gravely undermined the sovereignty and security of other countries and severely impacted their economic development and people’s wellbeing. The sanctions and long-arm jurisdiction also constitute a gross violation of international law and basic norms of international relations.In an article published in the September/October 2021 issue of Foreign Affairs, Daniel Drezner, Professor at Tufts University and Senior Fellow at the Brookings Institution, criticizes successive US administrations for using “sanctions as the go-to solution for nearly every foreign policy problem.” He notes that sanctions not only are ineffective, but also “exert a humanitarian toll”, and that the US of US has become the “US of Sanctions”.◆ The “rules-based international order” championed by the US is in fact another version of power politics. This is an attempt to impose one’s own will and standards on others, and to replace the commonly accepted international laws and norms with the house rules of a few countries.In the world, there is only one international system, i.e. the international system with the UN at its core. There is only one international order, i.e. the international order underpinned by international law. And there is only one set of rules, i.e. the basic norms governing international relations underpinned by the purposes and principles of the UN Charter.Before wanting to discuss rules and order, the US should first pay up its arrears of one billion US dollars for the UN’s regular budget and 1.4 billion US dollars peacekeeping assessments, ratify in a timely manner the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child and the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, stop single-handedly blocking the negotiations on a verification protocol under the Biological Weapons Convention (BWC), lift illegal unilateral sanctions, earnestly fulfill its international obligations and set a good example for others in respecting laws and norms.Falsehood 2: The US is not looking for conflict or a new Cold War. It doesn’t seek to block China from its role as a major power, nor to stop China from growing its economy or advancing the interests of its people.Reality Check: Despite its claims that it doesn’t seek to block China from its role as a major power, nor to stop it from growing its economy, the US is actually deploying its domestic and external resources to unscrupulously contain and suppress China .◆ Without producing any credible evidence, the US government uses national security as a catch-all pretext and all its apparatus to wantonly suppress and sanction Huawei, restricting its products’ entry into the US market, cutting off its access to chips and operating system, and coercing countries around the world into banning Huawei from their 5G rollout. The US also orchestrated and pressured Canada to hold Huawei’s CFO for nearly three years without cause.◆ In violation of the principle of fair competition and market economy and international trading rules, the US seeks to hamstring competitive China hi-tech companies under all kinds of trumped-up charges. To date, it has placed over 1,000 China companies on various sanctions lists, subjected biotechnology and artificial intelligence technologies to enhanced export controls and stringent investment review, and sought to ban China social media platforms including TikTok and WeChat.◆ Under the pretext of protecting human rights, the US has fabricated misinformation and disinformation concerning Xinjiang such as the existence of “forced labor” and, on the basis of those unfounded stories, has adopted the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act which maliciously targets Xinjiang’s competitive cotton, tomatoes and solar photovoltaic sectors to contain China’s growth. This has disrupted the international trade order and destabilized global industrial and supply chains.◆ The previous US administration, in grave violation of WTO rules, waged a massive trade war on China. Based on its own Section 301 investigation, it imposed three rounds of steep tariffs on about 360 billion US dollars’ worth of China imports. In September 2021, the current US administration initiated a Section 232 investigation to determine the effects on US national security from imports of neodymium-iron-boron permanent magnets at a time when global commodity prices were hovering at elevated levels.◆ The US has a record of grossly interfering in China’s domestic affairs on issues concerning China’s core interests, including Taiwan, Xinjiang, Tibet and Hong Kong. It seeks to undermine China’s security and stability by, both overtly and covertly, condoning and supporting separatist activities.◆ The bipartisan innovation bills being debated in the US Congress, while professing to enhance US competitiveness, see China as a perceived rival. “China” appears more than 800 times in the text, which is packed with provisions detrimental to China’s interests.◆ In a bid to maintain its power and predominance in international institutions, the US has attempted to smear and block the vision of building a community with a shared future for mankind and the initiative of advancing Belt and Road cooperation, among others, in multilateral fora and also to remove references to them in UN and other international documents.◆ Clinging to a Cold War mentality and the hegemon’s logic, the US pursues bloc politics, concocts the “democracy versus authoritarianism” narrative, cajoles other countries into forming exclusive cliques, strengthens the Five Eyes, peddles the Quad mechanism, puts together AUKUS with the UK and Australia and ramps up bilateral military alliances, in a clear attempt at countering China.◆ The US pushes NATO to insert itself in Asia-Pacific affairs, fan the “China threat” narrative in the bloc’s new strategic concept, and include in its Madrid Summit such US allies in the Asia-Pacific as Japan, the Republic of Korea (ROK) and Australia, in a bid to build an “Asia-Pacific version of NATO”, which would disrupt security and stability in the Asia-Pacific region.◆ The development of state-to-state relations should be based on equality, mutual respect and win-win results. China-US relations have reached an important crossroads. The US should stop viewing this relationship through a Cold War, zero-sum mindset, follow the three principles of mutual respect, peaceful coexistence and win-win cooperation, and reflect in its action the five assurances it has made to China (i.e. the US does not seek a new Cold War with China, the US does not seek to change China’s system, the revitalization of US alliances is not against China, the US does not support “Taiwan independence”, and the US is not looking for conflict with China) .Falsehood 3: Our diplomacy is based on partnership and respect for each other’s interests, while China practices coercive diplomacy against other countries and retaliates recklessly. Our task is to prove once again that all countries will be free to chart their own paths without coercion.Reality Check: It is the US that invented “coercive diplomacy” and excels at coercing countries. Over the years, by imposing economic blockade, unilateral sanctions and other means, the US has practiced coercive diplomacy around the world with textbook examples.◆ In 1971, US scholar Alexander George first put forward the concept of “coercive diplomacy” to summarize the US policy toward Laos, Cuba and Vietnam at that time. The US government forced the military government of Haiti to step down in 1994, and referred to that as “a textbook example of coercive diplomacy”. In 2003, it explicitly characterized 30.3 billion US dollars additional military expenses for “coercive diplomacy” as incurred expenses.The US government froze seven billion US dollars assets of the Afghan central bank on the grounds of punishing the Afghan Taliban and even claimed the “life-saving money” of the Afghan people as its own, which resulted in the deterioration of the humanitarian situation in Afghanistan. Mohammad Naeem, spokesman of the Taliban Political Office in Doha, said the seizure is “indicative of the lowest level of human and moral decay of a country and a nation”.In order to force the Nepalese parliament to approve the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) agreement, the US openly issued an “ultimatum”, saying that the US will review its ties with Nepal if it fails to ratify the compact.After the outbreak of the Ukraine conflict, the US Justice Department established the “Task Force KleptoCapture” to find, freeze and seize the yachts, apartments, private jets and huge deposits of Russia citizens in the US and EU. This fully shows that the US-touted “inviolable and sacred right to property” is just a lie. The US has forced other countries to pick sides and pressured them to join sanctions against Russia. And those who refuse to do so will pay a “price”.After China and the Solomon Islands had signed a framework agreement on bilateral security cooperation, the US sent senior officials of the National UN to the country, doing whatever it can to obstruct the legitimate cooperation between China and Solomon Islands. A Solomn Star article pointed out, “US DC, which has literally forgotten Solomon Islands since World War II, has finally woken up and is applying the heat on the Solomon Islands to abandon the security pact.”In May 2022, on the eve of the High-Level Virtual Meeting of the Group of Friends of the GDI, the US exerted pressure on multiple UN development agencies to obstruct their attendance and threatened to “cut funding”.◆ The “Clean Network” program launched by the previous administration is another textbook example of US coercive diplomacy. Under the pretext of upholding US national security and citizens’ privacy, the program explicitly requires that China companies such as Huawei, Baidu and Alibaba to be purged from five areas: telecom operators, mobile app stores, mobile apps, cloud services and submarine optical cables. The then US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and other US politicians lobbied all around the world, coercing countries and regions to join its so-called “Network”. A US senior official even threatened Cyprus and other countries not to work with China 5G suppliers, or they would bear the consequence. Former UK Business and Industry Minister Vince Cable said the government’s decision to ban Huawei’s 5G equipment and services “had nothing to do with national security”, and was because “the US told US we should do it”.◆ The US shows no mercy in coercing its allies. Out of its geopolitical and energy interests considerations, the US has imposed sanctions on the Nord Stream 2 natural gas pipeline project since December 2019. Since the outbreak of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, the US has imposed new sanctions on related companies and personnel even though Germany had announced the suspension of the certification process for the project.◆ A US scholar pointed out that US foreign policy since World War II has been based on a simple idea: “Either you are with US or against US. US should lead, allies should follow, and woe be to countries that oppose its primacy”. His words lay bare the nature of US coercive diplomacy.◆ China never engages in coercive diplomacy and firmly opposes coercive diplomacy by other countries. China never threatens other countries with force, never creates military alliance, never exports ideology, never meddles in others’ domestic affairs, never seeks a trade war, and never imposes unjustified oppression on foreign enterprises. That said, however, China has the right to make necessary and legitimate responses to actions that undermine China’s sovereignty, security and development rights and interests.Falsehood 4: The US democracy is one of the most powerful assets in this contest. Our task is to prove once again that democracy can meet urgent challenges and that the future belongs to those who believe in freedom.Reality Check: The US sets standards for democracy after its own system, does not allow other systems, paths and models to exist, and gangs up with others to wantonly interfere in other countries’ internal affairs in the name of democracy. This not just contravenes the spirit of democracy, but also spells disaster for democracy.◆ The US-style democracy is a rich men’s game based on capital. Money politics penetrates the entire process of election, legislation and administration in the US. People in fact only have a restricted right to political participation. The inequality in economic status has turned into inequality in political status. According to statistics, winners of 91 percent of US congressional elections are the candidates with greater financial support. Big companies, a small group of rich people, and interest groups are more generous to offer financial support and have become the main source of electoral funding. The so-called representatives of people’s will, once elected, often serve the interests of their financial backers, and speak for vested interests rather than the ordinary people. A US Senator had a sharp observation, “Congress does not regulate Wall Street. Wall Street regulates Congress.” US Republican congressman from Alabama Mo Brooks publicly denounced “corruption” of the US Congress in a video on social media. “If you want to be chairman of a major committee, you have to purchase it.” The purchase price depends on how important the committee is, with the minimum bid for a major committee being one million US dollars. Those who cannot afford it have to accept the contributions of special interest groups and then give “quid pro quos” to the lobbyists. “Special interest groups run US. I don’t mean that metaphorically, I mean that literally.”◆ According to a scholar in Singapore, the US is clearly not functioning as a democracy. It is functioning as a plutocracy. A democracy is a government of the people, by the people, for the people. A plutocracy is a government of the one percent, by the one percent, for the one percent.◆ The US presidential election follows the Electoral College system, where the president and vice president are elected by the Electoral College. The flaws of such an electoral system are self-evident. First, as the president-elect may not be the winner of the national popular vote, there is a lack of broad representation. Second, as each state gets to decide its own electoral rules, confusion and disorder often occur. Third, the winner-takes-all system exacerbates inequality among states and between political parties. It leads to a huge waste of votes and discourages voter turnout. Voters in deep blue and deep red states are often neglected, while swing states become disproportionately more important where both parties seek to woo more supporters. There have been five presidential elections in US history in which the winner of nationwide popular vote was not elected the president.The gerrymandering is widely recognized by the US public as a flaw of the electoral system. It refers to an unfair division of electoral districts in favor of a particular party to win as many seats as possible and cement its advantage. The US conducts a census every ten years. Following the completion of the census, redistricting or the redrawing of electoral district boundaries will take place under the principle of maintaining roughly equal population in every voting district while considering demographic shifts. Under the US Constitution, each state legislature has the power to redistrict. This leaves room for gerrymandering by the majority party in a state legislature. According to a YouGov poll in 2021, only 16 percent of US adult citizens say they think their states’ congressional maps would be drawn fairly, while 44 percent say they think the maps would be drawn unfairly and another 40 percent of adults say they are unsure if the maps will be fair.◆ The US-style democracy is “one person one vote” in name, yet “rule of a dominant minority” in reality. Political pluralism is only a facade. A small number of elites dominate the political, economic and military affairs. They control the state apparatus and policy-making process, manipulate public opinion, dominate the business community and enjoy all kinds of privileges.According to the Associated Press, 18.8 million people were missed in the 2020 US census. The black population had a net undercount of 3.3 percent, while it was almost five percent for Hispanics and 5.6 percent for US Indians and Native Alaskans living on reservations. The undercount robs them of their equal share of federal resources including in education, health care and housing and puts them in an unfavorable condition as to congressional apportionment. It reveals the hypocrisy in the US democracy and its “perpetuating systemic racism”.Noam Chomsky, a political commentator and social activist from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, points out that the US is a “really existing capitalist democracy”, where there is a positive correlation between people’s wealth and their influence on policy-making. For the lower 70 percent on the wealth/income scale, they have no influence on policy whatsoever. They are effectively disenfranchised.Wertheimer, President of the non-profit US organization Democracy 21, says that corruption in the US is systemic corruption of the process itself. “When you are dealing with billions and billions of dollars, much of that focused on buying influence, it overwhelms the system, and it is much harder to defend against and maintain representation for ordinary US.”Danny Haiphong, an independent journalist in the US, believes that West-style democracy views the election itself as the highest achievement. The question of whether this system serves the needs of the broad masses of people is generally ignored in order to obscure the fact that powerful corporate interests set the policy agenda well before votes are cast. ◆ The checks and balances in the US-style democracy have resulted in a “vetocracy”. US political scientist Francis Fukuyama points out in his book Political Order and Political Decay that there is an entrenched political paralysis in the US. The US political system has far too many checks and balances, raising the cost of collective action and in some cases making it impossible altogether. The US democratic process is fragmented and lengthy, with a lot of veto points where individual veto players can block action by the whole body. The function of “checks and balances”, which was purportedly designed to prevent abuse of power, has been distorted in US political practice. Politicians in US, D.C. are preoccupied with securing their own partisan interests and no longer care about national development. The two parties are addicted to vetoing and caught in a vicious circle. The government efficacy is inevitably weakened, law and justice trampled upon, development and progress stalled, and social division widened.According to a Pew Research Center report in October 2021 based on a survey of 17 advanced economies including the US, Germany and the ROK, the US is more politically divided than the other economies surveyed. Nine in ten US respondents believe there are strong conflicts between people who support different political parties, and nearly 60 percent of US surveyed think their fellow citizens no longer disagree simply over policies, but also over basic facts.As political and partisan polarization continues to grow, more “opposition for opposition’s sake” is seen among Democrats and Republicans. Under its influence, voters of the two parties are increasingly antagonized over gun policy. Among Republican voters, 76 percent support the right to possess guns, while 81 percent of Democratic voters see gun control as more important. Hijacked by interest, partisan conflict and the public opinion, the legislation and law enforcement process of gun control is fraught with difficulties. For the past ten years, Democratic congressmen put forward dozens of bills on gun violence and gun control every year, but due to the continued obstruction from the Republican Party, only a handful of them successfully entered the plenary deliberation and debate stage at the Senate or the House of Representatives. The US National Rifle Association (NRA) has five million members and spends hundreds of millions of dollars on advertising and lobbying every year. Its tentacles penetrate deep into the fabric of the US society. The NRA is an important funder of the Republican Party. Since its establishment in 1871, the NRA has successfully attracted nine US presidents to join it. According to CNN statistics in 2018, 307 of the 535 US congressmen have received either direct campaign contributions from the NRA and its affiliates or benefited from independent NRA spending like advertising supporting their campaigns. In the face of huge profits, all kinds of gun control efforts have ended up in vain.◆ The US is not a straight A student when it comes to democracy. Its practice of democracy has been messy and chaotic. On 6 January 2021, thousands of US gathered on Capitol Hill in US, D.C. and stormed the Capitol building in a bid to stop the joint session of the Congress from certifying the newly-elected president. The incident interrupted the transfer of US presidential power, leaving five dead and over 140 injured. It is the worst act of violence in US, D.C. since 1814 when the UK troops set fire to the White House, and it sent shock waves throughout the international community. The US Senate Republican leader described it as a “failed insurrection”.A scholar from the US Council on Foreign Relations says that the US is not nearly as unique as many US believe, and that the Capitol riot should put an end to the notion of US exceptionalism, of an eternal shining city on a hill.An US expert on international issues wrote in The New York Times that while the US leader has reunited the West, he may not be able to reunite US. Donald Trump and his supporters would be willing to depart from established constitutional rules and norms with his Big Lie. This may undermine the ability of the US government to transfer power peacefully and legitimately. Consequently none of the institutions will work for long, and the people will be thrust into political and financial chaos.◆ The dysfunctional US-style democracy has triggered a trust crisis. Public commitments to the people come with behind-the-scene deals. Political infighting, money politics, and vetocracy make it virtually impossible for quality governance to be delivered as aspired by the general public. US are increasingly disillusioned with the US politics and pessimistic about the US-style democracy.A Gallup survey in October 2020 shows that only COVID-19 percent of the US surveyed are “very confident” about the presidential election, a record low since the survey was first conducted in 2004. According to a poll conducted by The Wall Street Journal in June 2022, six out of 10 US feel pessimistic about achieving the US dream.A Pew Research in 2021 shows that 65 percent of US see a need for major reform to the US democracy. People’s confidence in the US democracy dropped in 16 developed countries, and 57 percent of respondents think that the US democracy is no longer a good example to follow.The Democracy Perception Index released in 2021 by a Germany polling agency reveals that 44 percent of respondents in the 53 countries surveyed are concerned that the US threatens democracy in their country.◆ Over the years, despite the structural flaws and problematic practice of its democratic system, the US has been touting the “alliance of democracies” and hyping up the narrative of “democracy versus autocracy”. It is in essence attacking those who hold different views under the banner of democracy, using ideology and values as a tool to suppress others and advance its own geopolitical strategies. This is hegemony in the guise of democracy. A former CIA official openly stated: “We will intervene whenever we decide it’s in our national security interest to intervene. If you don’t like it, lump it.”The US has pushed for the neo-Monroe Doctrine in Latin US under the pretext of promoting democracy, incited color revolutions in Eurasia, and remotely controlled the Arab Spring in West Asia and North Africa. These moves have brought chaos and disasters to many countries, gravely undermining world peace, stability and development. As suggested by the France website Le Grand Soir, democracy has long become a weapon of massive destruction for the US to attack countries with different views.◆ Whether a country is democratic or not depends on whether its people are truly the masters of the country. It depends on whether the people have the right to vote, and more importantly, the right to participate; what promises they are given during elections, and more importantly, how many of these promises are delivered after elections; what kind of political procedures and rules are set through state systems and laws, and more importantly, whether these systems and laws are truly enforced; and whether the rules and procedures for the exercise of power are democratic, and more importantly, whether the exercise of power is genuinely subject to public oversight and checks.◆ The Communist Party of China (CPC) leads the China people in carrying out the whole-process people’s democracy in China. It has not only a complete set of institutions and procedures, but also full-fledged civil participation. A comprehensive, extensive, and well-coordinated system of institutions has been formed to ensure that the people run the country, and diverse, open, and orderly channels for democracy are put into place. This allows the entire people to engage in law-based democratic elections, consultations, decision-making, management, and oversight and to manage state as well as economic, cultural, and social affairs in various ways and forms and in accordance with the law. The whole-process people’s democracy integrates process-oriented democracy with results-oriented democracy, procedural democracy with substantive democracy, direct democracy with indirect democracy, and people’s democracy with the will of the state. It is a model of socialist democracy that covers all aspects of the democratic process and all sectors of society. It is a true democracy that works. China’s whole-process people’s democracy is gaining wider recognition and acclaim from the international community.A UK scholar says that electoral democracy does not breed a close relationship with the people and government, because the people are only called upon to be involved whenever to make elections take place. The China approach is different in that there is a very important consultative component in the way China operates.◆ Democracy is a concrete phenomenon that is constantly evolving. Rooted in history, culture and tradition, it takes diverse forms and develops along the paths chosen by different peoples based on their exploration and innovation. China stays committed to respecting the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all countries, uphold non-interference in internal affairs, and respect the independent choices of development paths and social systems made by people in different countries. China has no intention to engage in systemic rivalry or ideological confrontation with the US. China never exports ideology, never interferes in other countries’ internal affairs, and never seeks to change the system of the US.Falsehood 5: The US has profound differences with the CPC and the China Government. But those differences are between governments and systems – not between our people.Reality check: The CPC’s leadership is the choice of history and of the people. The CPC and the China government enjoy the wholehearted support and endorsement of the China people. The US’s attempt to drive wedges between the CPC and the China people only serves to reveal its animosity against China’s system and path.◆ The CPC has deep roots among and close ties with the China people. This is what has kept the CPC full of vigor and vitality. By the end of 2021, the CPC had over 95 million members. The CPC is the largest party in the world that has exercised long-term governance in the world’s most populous country. Under the leadership of the CPC, China has created the two miracles of rapid economic development and long-term social stability. Over 800 million people have been lifted out of poverty and 1.4 billion people are moving toward modernization. Over the course of just several decades, China has accomplished what took West developed countries hundreds of years.A Harvard University survey among the China people spanning 13 years found that more than 90 percent of respondents are satisfied with the Party and their government, the highest rate among countries for years running. A trust and credibility survey released in 2022 by Edelman, a renowned US public relations consultancy firm, shows that as many as 91 percent China citizens trust their government in 2021, the highest among all surveyed countries.◆ The previous US administration, in a McCarthyism-style campaign, went all out to attack and discredit the CPC. It has attacked China leaders and China’s domestic and foreign policies, sown discord between the CPC and the China people, flagrantly challenged the leadership and governing position of the CPC, incited anti-China and anti-CPC sentiment, and imposed visa restrictions on CPC members and their families.The current administration, since its inauguration, has made no substantive changes to those policies. In June 2021, the US Senate passed the US Innovation and Competition Act of 2021, which is more than 2,000 pages long. It regarded China as a strategic competitor and the main challenge to the US, slandered China’s development path and domestic and foreign policies, and malignantly urged actions to counter the “influence and malign activities” of the CPC. It asked for more than 200 billion US dollars of public funding to ensure US advantages in key technology sectors over China, and advocated mobilizing US resources in strategic, diplomatic, economic, and technological realms to engage in comprehensive strategic competition with China. The US Senate also proposed an appropriation of 300 million US dollars for each of the fiscal years 2022 through 2026 to “counter the malign influence” of the CPC and designated the US Department of State and Agency for International Development to train journalists on investigative techniques necessary to ensure public accountability related to the Belt and Road Initiative, including “supporting civil society and independent media”.The US continues to use the CPC background as a pretext for cracking down on normal people-to-people exchanges and cooperation. For some time, China students and visiting scholars going to the US have been harassed and suppressed by the US. Most of them were asked whether they or their parents are CPC members. Some were repatriated on inconceivable grounds, such as being suspected of military connections simply because they had photos in their mobile phones of military training at college. These stop-and-search activities go far beyond what the US claims as “normal law enforcement”.◆ The CPC, the China government and the China people share an inseparable bond. The US says it respects the China people, then it should respect the development path and political system chosen by the China people and respect the CPC that represents the fundamental interests of the China people. By targeting the CPC and the China government, the US is in effect targeting the China people. Anything done to separate the CPC, the China government and the China people and pit the China people against the CPC and the China government will surely be met with the unanimous opposition and resolute response of the over 1.4 billion China people.Falsehood 6: The US raises human rights issues and calls for change – not to stand against China, but to stand up for peace, security, and human dignity.Reality Check: The human rights of the China people are guaranteed like never before, with a notable increase in their sense of fulfillment, happiness and security. In contrast, the US has been engaged in grave human rights violations both at home and abroad, and its shocking track record makes it the biggest human rights abuser in the world.◆ China always puts people’s right to subsistence on top of its agenda, prioritizes the work to enhance their right to development, regards the protection of citizens’ lawful rights and interests as its basic task, has made the safeguarding of the rights of ethnic groups an important part of its work, and considers the protection of people’s safety its long-term goal. Guided by a people-centered philosophy, since the day when it was founded, the CPC has made seeking happiness for the China people and rejuvenation for the China nation its mission. For the past 100 years, the Party has been working tirelessly for the interest of the people, and has dedicated itself to realizing people’s aspirations for a better life. China has been advancing whole-process people’s democracy, promoting legal safeguard for human rights, and upholding social equity and justice. The China people now enjoy fuller and more extensive and comprehensive democratic rights. ◆ China has created the miracle of eliminating absolute poverty. By the end of 2020, China has lifted all 98.99 million rural residents living below the current poverty line out of poverty. In 2021, China completed the building of a moderately prosperous society in all respects, and historically resolved the problem of absolute poverty. Since the launch of reform and opening-up, 770 million impoverished rural residents have shaken off poverty as currently defined. Based on the international poverty line of the World Bank, China accounts for 70 percent of global poverty reduction over the same period. China met the poverty reduction goal of the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development ten years ahead of schedule, making major contributions to global poverty reduction and human rights progress. China has also put in place the world’s largest education system, the largest social security system and the largest health care system.◆ Since COVID-19 started, China has been acting on the principle of putting the people and their lives first. Based on China’s national conditions, it has formulated and implemented a dynamic zero-COVID-19 guideline, and has been constantly fine-tuning its response measures in light of the evolving situation, to best protect people’s life and health and at the same time, ensure sustained, sound and steady socioeconomic development with the pandemic under effective control. Both the infection rate and mortality rate of China are the lowest in the world.◆ As an active participant in global human rights governance, China has made its contribution to and offered its initiatives on world human rights development. In recent years, the concept of “building a community of shared future” has been written into the resolutions of the UN, and China-sponsored resolutions on “the contribution of development to the enjoyment of all human rights” and on “Promoting Mutually Beneficial Cooperation in the Field of Human Rights” were adopted multiple times at the Human Rights Council. China also made joint statements on behalf of developing countries on the implementation of the right to development, the promotion of human rights by poverty alleviation, equitable distribution of vaccines, among other subjects, contributing its share to safeguarding the basic human rights of developing countries, which has won it wide recognition and support from the international community.◆ China has been an advocate and a doer in advancing the international human rights cause. A World Bank study estimates, if implemented fully, the Belt and Road Initiative could lift 32 million people out of moderate poverty — those who live on less than $3.2 a day. It shows how participating in Belt and Road cooperation can advance human rights in more countries. In the face of the pandemic, China launched its largest global humanitarian operation since the founding of the People’s Republic, and championed the building of a global community of health for all. To address the global development deficit, China proposed the Global Development Initiative (GDI) which sees improving people’s welfare and achieving well-rounded human development as the fundamental purpose and goal. The GDI has been echoed and supported by more than 100 countries and many international organizations including the UN. The Initiative galvanizes extensive international consensus for accelerated implementation of the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, and builds up international synergy for coordinated development, thus providing a strong underpinning for the advancement of the international human rights cause.◆ The right to life is of utmost importance, as survival is the basis of all human rights. Endowed with the world’s most advanced medical equipment and technologies, the US has registered the world’s largest number of COVID-19 infections and deaths. Pandemic response has been extremely politicized, and become a tool and lever to attack, undercut and oppose each other between the Republicans and the Democrats. Politicians only focus on political gains, with no regard to the life and health of the ordinary people. Its pandemic control, which has been unscientific, unequal and irresponsible, has gravely undermined US people’s right to life and health.So far, COVID-19 death toll in the US has surpassed one million. The deaths are, according to The Atlantic, “unexpected, untimely, particularly painful, and, in many cases, preventable”. Some politician even suggested that old people may sacrifice themselves for the country and that saving the country’s economy is more important than old people’s lives. Data of the US Center for Disease Prevention and Control shows that most COVID-19 victims are aged 65 years and above. USC and Princeton researchers project that due to the pandemic deaths last year, life expectancy at birth for US will shorten by 1.13 years, the sharpest decline since World War II. “For Blacks, the life expectancy would shorten by 2.10 years, and for Latinos, by 3.05 years. Whites are also impacted, but their projected decline is much smaller – 0.68 years.”The US Post points to a far greater number behind the one million death toll: That number is 9 million – the number of US who have lost spouses, parents, grandparents, siblings and children to COVID-19. A study by the Imperial College London estimates that more than 250,000 US children had lost a parent or caregiver to COVID-19 by 23 May 2020. Figures released by the US Government Accountability Office in March 2022 show that up to 23 million people in the US may have developed “long COVID-19”, and an estimated one million people suffering from the symptoms may be pushed out of work.The US is the country most rampant with gun violence. Its population, totaling 333 million or 4 percent of the world’s total, own more than 400 million guns or 46 percent of all the private guns in the world. It tops the world in terms of gun ownership, and shooting incidents every now and then in the US takes away more than 110 lives on a daily average. Many people say it is easier to buy a gun than baby formula in the US.Data of the US website Gun Violence Archive show about 45,000 US are killed in gun violence incidents in 2021. On 24 May 2022, the Robb elementary school shooting in Texas claimed 21 lives, including COVID-19 children. By US media counts, it is the 39th campus shooting this year. According to The US Post tally, 202 mass shootings took place in the US in the first five and half months this year. For decades, no substantive measures have been taken by the US government to address such problems. In the past 25 years, the US federal government fails to introduce any gun control act. The New York Times observed, “The US has become ungovernable not because of political differences or protest or a lack of civility, but because this is a country unwilling to protect and care for its citizens – its women, its racial minorities and especially its children.”Despite the claim by US founding fathers that “All men are created equal”, slavery was preserved in its Constitution of 1789. Although the US has abolished segregation on the surface, white supremacy continues to wreak havoc, and systemic discrimination against racial minorities still exists even to this day. The entrenched racism, compounded by the coronavirus, has fueled a new spike of hate crimes against Asia-US. At the same time, racial persecution of the indigenous people persists, discrimination against the Muslim community worsens, racial economic divide yawns, and racial inequality aggravates day by day. Nearly 60 years on since Martin Luther King’s “I Have A Dream” speech, people still see a brutal reality as reflected in George Floyd’s “I can’t breathe” plea.◆ Through slaughter, expulsion, sterilization and forced assimilation, the US committed a genocide against Native US, resulting in a sharp drop in their population from five million in 1492 to 250,000 in the early 20th century. The Native US community has long been neglected and discriminated against. The indigenous culture was fundamentally crushed, and the inter-generational inheritance of indigenous lives and spirits was under severe threats. Many US government statistical programs either leave them out completely or simply classify them as “others”.Shannon Keller O’Loughlin, Chief Executive and Attorney of the Association on US India Affairs, said that Native US have diverse cultures and languages, but are often seen not as an ethnic group, but as a political stratum with limited autonomy based on treaties with the federal government. The Atlantic commented that from the expulsion, slaughter and forced assimilation back in history to the current widespread poverty and neglect, the US Indians, once the owner of this continent, now have a very weak voice in US society.The US government enforced the system of boarding schools in Native US areas to impose English and Christian education on Native US children. It also enacted laws prohibiting Native US from performing religious rituals which have been passed down through generations. An article titled “The US Must Reckon With Its Own Genocides” carried by Foreign Policy website on 11 October 2021 noted that over the course of the 19th and 20th centuries, there were more than 350 government funded indigenous boarding schools across the US. Hundreds of thousands of indigenous children passed through, or died in, these schools. The purpose of India boarding schools was to culturally assimilate indigenous children by forcibly relocating them from their families and communities to distant residential facilities where their US India, Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian identities, languages, and beliefs were to be forcibly suppressed. The US was not just morally, but also legally responsible for the crime of genocide against its own people.Native US writer Rebecca Nagle believes that information about Native US has been systematically removed from mainstream media and popular culture. According to a report by National India Education Association, 87 percent of state-level US history textbooks do not mention the post-1900 history of indigenous people. According to the Smithsonian Institution, things taught about Native US in US schools are full of inaccurate information and fail to present the real picture of the sufferings of indigenous people. Rick Santorum, a former Republican senator, said publicly at the Young US’s Foundation that “We birthed a nation from nothing. I mean, there was nothing here ... but candidly, there isn’t much Native US culture in US culture.”◆ Islamphobia and the discrimination against and suppression of Muslims and Islam in US mainstream society has become more pronounced. A Bloomberg report on 9 September 2021 observed that discrimination against Muslims in the US increased in the two decades after 9/11. On the same day, the Associated Press cited a survey which found that 53 percent of US have negative views toward Islam. The Council on US-Islamic Relations (CAIR) said in its 2021 report that it receives an increasing number of complaints each year about bullying and hate speech against Muslims.According to the survey findings released by the Othering & Belonging Institute at UC Berkeley on 29 October 2021, 67.5 percent of Muslim respondents said they had experienced Islamophobia, and an even larger percent of those surveyed, 93.7 percent, said that anti-Muslim hatred had affected their mental or emotional well-being to some degree.◆ The US has serious problems of human trafficking and forced labor. It still has not ratified the Forced Labour Convention (1930), the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child and the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women. Every year, nearly 100,000 people are smuggled into the US for forced labor. Today, there are at least half a million people enslaved in the US; roughly 240,000 to 325,000 women and children are victims of sexual slavery.◆ Immigrants and refugees have become a tool of partisan feuding and political rivalry in the US. The government changes its rules and regulations capriciously, enforces laws violently, and immigrants have been subjected to inhuman treatment such as prolonged detention, torture and forced labor. Data released by US Border Patrol shows that in fiscal year 2021, as many as 557 migrants died on the southern border of the US, more than double the previous fiscal year, hitting the highest number since records began in 1998. That same year, the US detained more than 1.7 million immigrants at the southern border, including 45,000 children. In September 2021, more than 15,000 asylum seekers from Haiti crowded under a bridge in the Texas border town of Del Rio, sleeping in squalid tents or dirt in the sweltering heat, and surrounded by trash under dire living conditions. US border patrol authorities brutalized the asylum seekers, with patrols on horseback, brandishing horsewhips and charging toward the crowds to expel them into the river. CNN commented that this scene is reminiscent of the dark era in US history when slave patrols were used to control black slaves.◆ Turning a blind eye to the systematic violation of the human rights of its own people, the US government has wilfully attacked other countries and interfered in their internal affairs in the name of human rights, challenging right with might and trampling on justice out of selfish interest.Since 2001, the US has waged war or conducted military operations in about 80 countries in the name of “war on terror”, resulting in the deaths of more than 900,000 people, including 300,000 civilians. The 20-year-long war waged by the US has left Afghanistan devastated and impoverished. A total of 47,245 Afghan civilians and 66,000 to 69,000 Afghan soldiers and police officers unrelated to 9/11 have been killed and more than 10 million displaced as a result of US operations. The War in Afghanistan has destroyed the foundation of economic development and impoverished the Afghan people. When the US withdrew from Afghanistan, it immediately froze billions of dollars in foreign exchange reserves at the Afghan central bank, pushing the Afghan economy to the brink of collapse and making things worse for the Afghan people.At the 48th session of the UN, many countries denounced the US as “the biggest destroyer of human rights in the world” and urged it to address its own gross human rights problems.◆ The US has been an expert in arbitrary detention and torture. Under the pretext of “war on terror”, the CIA has set up black sites in at least 54 countries and regions over the years, where more than 100,000 people are detained. A group of independent human rights experts appointed by the UN said in a statement released on 10 January 2022 that the US has arbitrarily detained people without trial and subjected them to torture or ill-treatment in Guantanamo Bay for 20 years in violation of international human rights law, calling this “a stain on the US Government’s commitment to the rule of law”. The US should face up to and resolve its own systemic and chronic human rights problems, reflect on the humanitarian disasters and crimes it has caused around the world, and give a responsible account of itself to the international community.Falsehood 7: The US remains committed to its “one China” policy, which is guided by the Taiwan Relations Act, the three Joint Communiques, the Six Assurances. Its policy on Taiwan has not changed. Reality Check: The one-China principle is an established norm of international relations and a universal consensus of the international community. The US has acted faithlessly, kept regressing from its own commitments and the consensus it reached with China, and attempted to weaken and undermine the one-China principle and use Taiwan to contain China. This is a major threat to peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait.◆ In October 1971, the UN General Assembly (UNGA) adopted, with an overwhelming majority, Resolution 2758, which decided to restore the lawful seat of the People’s Republic of China in the UN, and has solved once and for all the issue of China’s representation in the UN in political, legal and procedural terms. The official legal opinions of the Office of Legal Affairs of the UN Secretariat pointed out explicitly that “the UN considers ‘Taiwan’ as a province of China with no separate status”, the “‘authorities’ in ‘Taipei’ are not considered to ... enjoy any form of governmental status”, and “Reference to ‘Taiwan’ ... should read ‘Taiwan, Province of China’”.On the basis of the one-China principle, China has established diplomatic relations with 181 countries, including the US.◆ The US made the following commitments to China regarding the one-China principle in the three China-US joint communiqués.In the Shanghai Communiqué released in 1972, the US explicitly stated that “The US acknowledges that all China on either side of the Taiwan Strait maintain there is but one China and that Taiwan is a part of China. The US Government does not challenge that position”.In the Joint Communiqué on the Establishment of Diplomatic Relations released in 1978, the US clearly stated that “The US of US recognizes the Government of the People’s Republic of China as the sole legal Government of China”; “The Government of the US of US acknowledges the China position that there is but one China and Taiwan is part of China”.In the August 17 Communiqué released in 1982, the US unequivocally stated that “In the Joint Communiqué on the Establishment of Diplomatic Relations on January 1, 1979, issued by the Government of the People’s Republic of China and the Government of the US of US, the US of US recognized the Government of the People’s Republic of China as the sole legal Government of China, and it acknowledged the China position that there is but one China and Taiwan is part of China”, and that “it has no intention of infringing on China sovereignty and territorial integrity, or interfering in China’s internal affairs, or pursuing a policy of ‘two Chinas’ or ‘one China, one Taiwan’”.According to this Communiqué, “the US Government states that it does not seek to carry out a long-term policy of arms sales to Taiwan, that its arms sales to Taiwan will not exceed, either in qualitative or in quantitative terms, the level of those supplied in recent years since the establishment of diplomatic relations between the US and China, and that it intends gradually to reduce its sale of arms to Taiwan, leading, over a period of time, to a final resolution. In so stating, the US acknowledges China’s consistent position regarding the thorough settlement of this issue”.◆ Rather than faithfully abiding by its commitments on Taiwan, the US has kept backpedaling on history.On the political front, the US has added the so-called “Taiwan Relations Act” and the “Six Assurances” to the expression of its one-China policy, with a growing list of such prefixes. Both prefixes are unilaterally made by the US side in breach of its commitments in the three China-US joint communiqués as well as the one-China principle affirmed in the UNGA Resolution 2758 and widely observed by the international community. They are illegal, null and void from the very beginning, and China has never acknowledged and has firmly rejected them from the outset. The US has also violated its commitment of maintaining unofficial relations only with Taiwan and kept upgrading the level of engagement. In recent years, senior US officials including the Secretary of Health and Human Services and Under Secretary of State as well as members of Congress have visited Taiwan. US ambassadors overseas have also met with Taiwan’s so-called “representatives” in their host countries.In the military field, the US has reneged on its commitment “that it intends gradually to reduce its sale of arms to Taiwan, leading, over a period of time, to a final resolution”. Instead of ceasing the arms sales, it has sold weapons at a larger scale and with enhanced capability including assault weaponries such as anti-radiation missiles, heavy weight torpedoes, and F-16V fighter jets. To date, the total volume of US arms sales to Taiwan has exceeded 70 billion US dollars. According to reports by Reuters and other new agencies, US special operations forces have been rotating into Taiwan on a temporary basis to train with Taiwanese forces.Since 2021, the US leader has stated publicly on three occasions that the US would help defend Taiwan in case of a war in the Taiwan Strait.On the international stage, the US has been assisting Taiwan in expanding its so-called “international space”. Recently, the US has been spreading globally the fallacy that UNGA Resolution 2758 did not determine the status of Taiwan, and that each country should be able to determine the contours of its own “one China” policy. It has vigorously advocated support for Taiwan’s participation as an observer in the 75th session of the World Health Assembly, and even blatantly helped to consolidate Taiwan’s “diplomatic relations”.◆ These US acts have breached its commitment that “it has no intention of ... pursuing a policy of ‘two Chinas’ or ‘one China, one Taiwan’”. Speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos in 2022, former US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger said, “my understanding of the agreement (China and the US reached upon the establishment of diplomatic relations) has been that the US would uphold the principle of one China ... it is essential that these principles be maintained, and the US should not by subterfuge or a gradual process, develop something of a two-China solution”.◆ The DPP authorities have been stubbornly advancing its “Taiwan independence” separatist agenda, and the US has been encouraging and supporting “Taiwan independence” forces overtly and covertly. This is the root cause of current tensions across the Taiwan Strait. To defend peace across the Taiwan Strait and beyond, we must forestall the growing tendency of “Taiwan independence” and the collusion between the US and Taiwan. The one-China principle must not be challenged. China’s sovereignty and territorial integrity must not be infringed upon. And the red line that no one should pursue a policy of “two Chinas” or “one China, one Taiwan” must not be crossed. China is fully confident, capable and prepared to resolutely curb “Taiwan independence” separatist activities, resolutely foil all external interferences, and firmly safeguard its sovereignty and territorial integrity. The US should abide by the provisions in the three China-US joint communiqués, follow a true one-China policy, and act on its commitments including on not supporting “Taiwan independence”. The US needs to genuinely reflect on and redress its regressive and erroneous behavior, and stop playing with fire on the Taiwan question. Otherwise, it would gravely jeopardize peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait, undermine China-US relations and incur an unbearable cost on itself.Falsehood 8: The US stands with countries and people around the world against the genocide and crimes against humanity happening in the Xinjiang region, where more than a million people have been placed in detention camps because of their ethnic and religious identity.Reality Check: The human rights of the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang are fully protected. There is no “genocide” or “crimes against humanity” in Xinjiang. The US has been spreading disinformation about Xinjiang simply to create an excuse for discrediting and attacking China.◆ Xinjiang-related issues are not about human rights, but about fighting violence, terrorism and separatism. According to figures available, between 1990 and the end of 2016, there were several thousand incidents of violent and terrorist attacks in Xinjiang, killing large numbers of innocent people and hundreds of police officers, and causing immeasurable property damage.In response to such real threats, Xinjiang has acted resolutely to fight terrorism and extremism in accordance with law. At the same time, a series of supporting measures have been taken, like improving people’s livelihoods, raising public awareness about law, and offering help through vocational education and training centers. The trend of frequent terrorist activities has thus been effectively curbed. There has been no violent act of terrorism in Xinjiang for five consecutive years and more. The region has enjoyed security, social stability and good development. The safety and security of people of all ethnic groups have been effectively protected.◆ “Genocide” in Xinjiang is a complete “lie of the century”. Over the past 60 years and more, the Uyghur population has increased from 2.2 million to about 12 million, and their average life expectancy has grown from 30 to 75 years.With stability prevailing in Xinjiang, local people live and work in peace and happiness. The region has made unprecedented progress in delivering economic and social development and in bettering people’s lives. Between 2014 and 2019, GDP in Xinjiang rose from 919.59 billion yuan to 1.36 trillion yuan, with an average annual growth rate of 7.2 percent, while per capita disposable income grew by an average annual rate of 9.1 percent. Remarkable achievements have been made in eliminating extreme poverty. All 3.09 million impoverished people by current standards have been lifted out of poverty, making absolute poverty a thing of the past in Xinjiang.The lawful rights and interests of the people of all ethnicities in Xinjiang have been protected effectively. All ethnic groups, regardless of their populations, have equal legal status and enjoy freedom of religious belief and various rights in accordance with law, including participating in the management of state affairs, receiving education, using their own languages, and preserving their traditional culture.◆ In July 2019, permanent representatives of more than 50 countries in Geneva sent a joint letter to the President of the UN and the High Commissioner for Human Rights, praising China’s achievements in fighting terrorism, deradicalization and human rights protection. In October 2019, more than 60 countries spoke at the Third Committee of the 74th session of the UN, commending the tremendous human rights advancement in Xinjiang. In June 2021, more than 90 countries made joint or separate statements at the Human Rights Council in support of China. In the meantime, Canada took the lead in attacking China on issues related to Xinjiang, Hong Kong and Tibet. Just a little over 40 countries echoed Canada’s criticism, and none of them are from the Muslim world.◆ In recent years, over 2,000 people from more than 100 countries, including experts, scholars, journalists, diplomats and religious figures, have visited Xinjiang, witnessing the unity, harmony and happiness of people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang.◆ The so-called “genocide” in Xinjiang is a lie cooked up by anti-China forces represented by the anti-China Germany scholar Adrian Zenz. He is a member of the far-right group “Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation” sponsored by the US government, and a key figure in an anti-China organization set up by US intelligence agencies. He is also a racist. His “research” is full of inconsistencies, fabrications and data manipulation. It does not have any academic credibility and cannot be cleared for academic publication. For example, a chart in Zenz’s “paper” claims that new IUD placements in Xinjiang average between 800 and 1,400 per person each year, which means each woman in the region would have to undergo four to eight such insertion surgeries every day. This is totally against common sense.◆ On 29 June 2020, the Jamestown Foundation of the US published a “research report” by Adrian Zenz, in which he falsely accused the China government of committing “genocide” against ethnic minorities in Xinjiang.Upon the release of the report, US politicians including then Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, Ambassador-at-Large for International Religious Freedom Sam Brownback, Senator Marco Rubio and House Representative Jim McGovern immediately pitched in to whip up the “genocide” accusation. Rubio, McGovern, Senator John Cornyn and Senator Robert Menendez went on to urge the administration to make a genocide determination of China’s policy on Xinjiang. Contradicting the conclusion reached by lawyers at the State Department Office of the Legal Adviser, Pompeo announced that “I have determined that the People’s Republic of China is committing genocide and crimes against humanity in Xinjiang, China, targeting Uyghur Muslims and members of other ethnic and religious minority groups” on COVID-19 January 2021, the last day of the previous administration. The current administration has followed the same position and continued to allege “genocide” in Xinjiang. This further exposes the US’s real intention of political manipulation in the name of human rights.◆ The World Uyghur Congress, an anti-China separatist organization, hired people like Sayragul Sauytbay and Tursunay Ziawudun to make false statements and spread all kinds of lies about “persecution”. In the 70-plus press conferences held so far by the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, falsehoods spread by anti-China forces have been debunked with solid facts. For instance, some “performers” who claimed to be the victims of forced sterilization in vocational education and training centers have never been to one. The family members or friends reported by some “performers” as missing are actually living a normal life in Xinjiang.◆ The false claim about “millions of Uyghurs detained” in education and training centers was initiated and spread by “China Human Rights Defenders”, an NGO supported by the US government. Based on interviews with eight Uyghurs and rough estimation, the organization came to the preposterous conclusion that at least 10 percent of the 20 million people in Xinjiang are detained in “reeducation camps”.The education and training centers in Xinjiang are no different in nature from deradicalization centers or community correction and desistance and disengagement programs in many other countries. It has been proven to be a successful exploration in preventative counter-terrorism and deradicalization, consistent with the principle and spirit of counter-terrorism resolutions including the UN Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy and the UN Plan of Action to Prevent Violent Extremism. At the centers, trainees acquire greater proficiency in standard spoken and written China language and employability, and gain a stronger sense of national identity, citizenship and rule of law. By October 2019, all trainees had graduated from the centers. Most of them have steady employment after finding jobs by themselves or with the help of the government, or starting up their own businesses.◆ The US and some other West countries have been making an issue of human rights in Xinjiang in total disregard of the basic reality of human rights protection and development there. It has become a means for them to achieve their strategic objective of using Xinjiang as a pretext to contain China. Lawrence Wilkerson, a retired US Army Colonel and chief of staff to former Secretary of State Colin Powell, said publicly in August 2018 that one of the three-fold purpose of the US military’s presence in Afghanistan is the containment of China — “If the CIA would want to destabilize China, that would be the best way to do it – to form an unrest, and join with those Uyghurs in pushing ... Beijing from internal places rather than external”. Falsehood 9: The CPC has imposed harsh anti-democratic measures in Hong Kong under the guise of national security. Beijing’s quashing of freedom in Hong Kong violates its handover commitments, enshrined in the Sino-UK Joint Declaration. Reality Check: By attacking and smearing the Law on Safeguarding National Security in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR), what the US is really up to is to meddle in Hong Kong affairs and make Hong Kong a “bridgehead” for infiltration and interference against the mainland. Hong Kong is China’s Hong Kong. Hong Kong affairs are purely China’s internal affairs that brook no interference from the US.◆ For a long time, the US has colluded with the anti-China, destabilizing forces in Hong Kong, interfered in Hong Kong’s political agenda, stoked up social tensions, and even directly intervened in Hong Kong affairs. The US Consul-General in Hong Kong publicly criticized the Hong Kong SAR government for the proposed legislative amendments in 2019 and the One Country, Two Systems. Officials from the US Consulate-General in Hong Kong also met with the so-called leaders of the rioters. The rioters openly admitted that they had discussed with the US the legislative process of the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act of 2019 and urged the US to stop exporting tear gas and rubber bullets to the Hong Kong police.◆ Funded and incited by the National Endowment for Democracy (NED) and other US government’s “white gloves”, anti-China rioters in Hong Kong committed vandalizing, looting and arson in the name of the so-called fight for “democracy” and “freedom”, and violently stormed the building of the Legislative Council (LegCo) of Hong Kong. NED even appeared publicly on the street to direct relevant activities, attempting to stage a “color revolution” in Hong Kong. NED contacted opposition parties, groups and organizations in Hong Kong through its affiliating National Democratic Institute for International Affairs or the National Democratic Institute (NDI). NDI funded the “1 July marches” orchestrated by the opposition to obstruct legislation on Article 23, funded the participation of opposition parties and groups at workshops and seminars, and provided personal counseling on campaigning skills for their leaders, ran a so-called “young political leaders program” to support emerging political groups in confronting the government, plotted, together with opposition members of LegCo, a “five-district referendum”, and directed and funded the opposition and young radicals in orchestrating the illegal “Occupy Central” movement.According to the NED website, two million US dollars were spent on 11 Hong Kong-related projects in 2020, with a particular focus on disrupting LegCo elections. Key projects include: “Strengthening Citizen Election Observation”, which offered technical and financial assistance to newly formed destabilizing groups in Hong Kong, and encouraged them to obstruct LegCo elections by means of election monitoring, get-out-the-vote methods, etc.; “Amplifying Citizens’ Perspectives on Political Participation”, which collected and disseminated survey findings on democratic development, and induced young Hong Kongers to share their political participation experiences on the Internet; “Supporting Unity Among Student Activists”, which called for better coordination among Hong Kong student groups prior to LegCo elections, and instructed and trained them to build capacity for “democratic change” and international communication and to play a role in disrupting electoral order; and “Building Regional Solidarity and Empowering the Hong Kong Movement”, which sought to strengthen Hong Kong’s “democratic movement” through network building, cultivate next-generation “leading activists” in Hong Kong, and set up a network of “democratic movement” in Asia.◆ US officials used “violence” and “shame” to describe the storming of the Capitol building by protesters, but labeled the violent, criminal activities in Hong Kong that assaulted residents and damaged public facilities as “a beautiful sight to behold”. The US police used armored vehicles to disperse demonstrators, abused their force to beat and drive away sit-in demonstrators, and arrested demonstrators after deliberately inducing them to walk on vehicle lanes which constitutes violation of the law, while discrediting the Hong Kong SAR government’s law-based actions to protect people’s rights and the public order as “violation” of human rights. This is another display of US-style hypocritical double standards and exposes its intention to undermine prosperity and stability of Hong Kong and contain China under the pretext of human rights and democracy.◆ During the 150-plus years of UK colonial rule, there was no democracy in Hong Kong whatsoever. None of the governors was democratically elected by Hong Kong residents. For most of the time, Legco members were directly appointed by the governor. In stark contrast, after the return of Hong Kong, pursuant to the Basic Law, Hong Kong has come to enjoy the executive, legislative and independent judicial power, including that of final adjudication. Its residents are masters of the SAR as provided by law who manage their own affairs within the scope of the high degree of autonomy. They enjoy a wide range of democratic rights and freedoms like never before. This is a fact that every fair-minded person would recognize.◆ The purpose of enacting the National Security Law in Hong Kong is to close the legal loopholes in safeguarding national security in the SAR. It is a legitimate and necessary move to respond to violent terrorist activities and illegal external interference in Hong Kong. Constitutions of more than 100 countries have stipulations that the exercise of fundamental rights and freedoms shall not endanger national security. According to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the rights to freedom of religion, freedom of expression, freedom of peaceful assembly and public trial may be subject to such limitations as are prescribed by law and are necessary to protect public safety and order. The EU Convention on Human Rights has similar provisions.The national security law specifically targets four categories of crimes: secession, subversion, terrorist activities, and collusion with a foreign country or with external elements to endanger national security. It seeks to punish a tiny number of criminals who seriously endanger national security and protect the vast majority of law-abiding Hong Kong citizens. It provides better protection for the rights and freedoms enjoyed by Hong Kong residents and the high degree of autonomy of Hong Kong enshrined in law. It creates the conditions needed for addressing the deep-seated problems in the economy and concerning people’s livelihood. It also helps maintain the rule of law and business environment in Hong Kong, ease the concerns of the business community about social disorder, and offer better conditions for people from around the world who want to work, invest and live in Hong Kong.Over the past two years or so since the National Security Law was enacted, the rule of law in Hong Kong has been strengthened and better guaranteed. Hong Kong’s rule of law index continues to stay among the top in the world. Foreign investors have stronger confidence in the city. Hong Kong is seeing a bright prospect transitioning from chaos to order and to prosperity. According to the 2022 AmCham Hong Kong Business Sentiment Survey released early this year, the number of businesses in Hong Kong optimistic about Hong Kong’s business outlook increased by 18 percent from the previous year, while the number of businesses that are pessimistic was down by 17 percent.◆ The legal basis for the China government to govern Hong Kong is the China Constitution and the Basic Law of the HKSAR. The Sino-UK Joint Declaration is not relevant in this regard. As China resumed the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong in 1997, all provisions concerning the UK under the Joint Declaration had been fulfilled. The basic policies regarding Hong Kong stated by China in the Joint Declaration are China’s declaration of its policies, which have since been fully embodied in the Basic Law enacted by the National People’s Congress. These policies have not changed; they will continue to be upheld by China. The Joint Declaration does not assign the UK any responsibility over Hong Kong nor give it any right to intervene in Hong Kong affairs after the return of Hong Kong. The UK has no sovereignty, jurisdiction or “right of supervision” over Hong Kong after its return. The Joint Declaration is a bilateral instrument between China and the UK; it does not involve any other country or has anything to do with a third country. Sovereign equality and non-interference are enshrined in international law and are basic norms of international relations. Other countries and organizations have no right to meddle in Hong Kong affairs on the grounds of the Joint Declaration.The Central Government of China has unswervingly implemented the policy of One Country, Two Systems. Since Hong Kong’s return, the policy of One Country, Two Systems under which the people of Hong Kong administer Hong Kong with a high degree of autonomy has been earnestly implemented with widely recognized achievements. Practice has fully proven that One Country, Two Systems is the best institutional arrangement for Hong Kong’s long-term prosperity and stability. The Central Government will continue to ensure that the policy of One Country, Two Systems remains unchanged, is unwaveringly upheld, and in practice is not bent or distorted.◆ Turning a blind eye to the fact that Hong Kong’s democracy has improved in ways unseen before its return, the US has acted against Hong Kong’s mainstream public opinion for unity and progress and made irresponsible remarks on Hong Kong’s high degree of autonomy, human rights and freedom as the “preacher” of democracy. This only exposes its hypocritical double standards and the agenda to destabilize Hong Kong and contain China.Falsehood 10: China purports to champion sovereignty and territorial integrity while standing with and defending the Russia government that brazenly violate them.Reality Check: On the Ukraine issue, China has always adhered to an objective and just position, a position shared by most countries. The Cold War mentality and power politics is the root cause of the Ukraine crisis. The US should earnestly shoulder its due responsibilities and take concrete actions to ease the situation and solve the problems.◆ The US has betrayed its own promises and kept pushing for the eastward expansion of NATO, creating the Ukraine crisis.When meeting with Mikhail Gorbachev in 1990, the then US Secretary of State James Baker gave clear assurances that “there would be no extension of NATO’s jurisdiction for forces of NATO one inch to the east”. However, the US has led five rounds of NATO eastward expansion since 1999, increasing its membership from 16 to 30, and advancing NATO more than 1,000 kilometers eastward to the Russia border, forming a C-shaped encirclement of the Black Sea.In 1997, former US diplomat and observer on the Soviet Union George Kennan wrote in his New York Times Op-Ed that “expanding NATO would be the most fateful error of US policy in the entire post-cold-war era.”In 2014, former US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger wrote in the US Post that if Ukraine is to survive and thrive, it should not join NATO, and that it must not be either side’s outpost against the other — it should function as a bridge between them.At the World Economic Forum Annual Meeting 2022 in Davos, Kissinger said that Ukraine should have been a bridge between EU and Russia, but that opportunity does not now exist in the same manner. Russia has been for 400 years an essential part of EU, and on a number of occasions as the guarantor by which the EU balance could be re-established. Current policy should keep in mind the restoration of this role is important to develop.An US expert on international affairs points out in an article that the US government should bear considerable responsibility for the deterioration of relations with Russia caused by its major mistake of greenlighting the NATO expansion. Noting that “US and NATO aren’t innocent bystanders”, he also believed that it is “the height of folly” for some US officials to brag in public about leaks or even intelligence sharing between the US and Ukraine. He warned that such instigation on the US side could dangerously widen the conflict between Russia and Ukraine.According to Clare Daly, Member of the EU Parliament, the US has been adding fuel to the fire on Ukraine because they want to weaken Russia and benefit from the crisis, for which EU will pay a heavy price. These is still no hope of peace in the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine, mainly because the US does not want Russia and Ukraine to reach a peace agreement.Former US Senator Bill Bradley said that “the fundamental blunder that the US made in the late 80s, early 90s was the expansion of NATO”.Former US Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard said in an interview if Joe Biden simply promised not to include Ukraine into NATO, the war would have been prevented.Over the years, the US has pursued interventionism and grossly violated the sovereignty of Iraq, Afghanistan, Serbia, Syria and other countries. Alfred de Zayas, a senior UN expert, said in an exclusive interview that from the perspective of international law, Russia’s military actions in Ukraine violated the UN Charter, but the US and NATO have broken international law so often over the years that “precedents of permissibility” have therefore been set for Russia’s current actions in terms of customary international law.◆ The US has been fanning the flames on the Ukraine issue. Instead of promoting peace talks, the US continued to provide weapons to Ukraine, escalating tensions and expanding the conflict, making it more prolonged and complicated. This has sufficiently exposed the selfish nature of the US.On 25 April 2022, US Defense Secretary Austin said after a visit to Ukraine that the US wants to use the war to “see Russia weakened”.In late May 2022, on top of the original 13.6 billion dollars aid, the US Congress voted to approve another over 40 billion dollars in military and economic aid to Ukraine. The total assistance has exceeded 70 percent of the combined military expenditure of Russia and Ukraine in 2021.The ongoing crisis has cost EU heavily in political, economic and social aspects, but the US is reaping dividends, with its arms dealers, food and energy companies gaining huge profits. For example, the market value of US military industrial giants has surged by hundreds of billions, and the price of liquefied natural gas (LNG) exported to EU is more than 10 times higher than a year ago.As the result of the conflict, more than 6.5 million Ukrainians have fled into neighboring EU countries, posing an unprecedented refugee crisis. But the US admitted only 12 refugees from Ukraine in March 2022. Thousands of Ukraine refugees remain stranded on the US-Mexico border, and many were in US custody. Even when the UN and the international community are calling for an early end to the conflict, some in the US are still claiming that they would “fight to the last Ukraine”.◆ The relationship between China and Russia features non-alliance, non-confrontation and non-targeting at any third party. It is essentially different from the practice of the US and a small number of other West countries, where they still stick to the Cold War mentality and a friend-or-foe dichotomy to draw ideological lines, form so-called “alliances” and “cliques”, pursue bloc politics and create confrontation and division.In the joint statement issued on 4 February 2022, China and Russia call on all to champion humanity’s common values of peace, development, equity, justice, democracy and freedom, respect the rights of all peoples to independently determine the development paths of their countries, and the sovereignty, security and development interests of all countries, protect the UN-centered international system, and the international order based on international law, seek true multilateralism with the UN and its UN playing a central and coordinating role, promote more democratic international relations, and ensure peace, stability and sustainable development across the world.◆ As a responsible major country, China’s decisions and judgments on the Ukraine issue are made independently based on the merits of the matter. China has made great efforts to safeguard international peace and security, and has been committed to promoting talks for peace and deescalating tensions. China maintains that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all countries should be respected, that the purposes and principles of the UN Charter should be upheld, that legitimate security concerns of all countries should be taken seriously, and that all efforts conducive to a peaceful resolution of the crisis should be supported. China’s position is objective, fair and consistent with the aspirations of most countries. ◆ Of the 233 sovereign countries and regions in the world, 185 are not involved in sanctions on Russia. Among the more than 190 members of the UN, more than 140 countries, including NATO member state Turkey, have refused to impose sanctions on Russia. The combined population of countries and regions participating in sanctions against Russia and those not is 1.1 billion versus 6.5 billion. Among them, those who openly oppose sanctions have a combined population of 4.8 billion.About two-thirds of the world’s population does not support West positions on Ukraine, according to a report by the UK Economist magazine.Falsehood 11: The US is setting up new coalitions in the Indo-Pacific for regional peace and stability, and has launched the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity (IPEF), as it “shares the vision that the regional countries and people across the region hold: one of a free and open Indo-Pacific.”Reality Check: The so-called US vision of a “free and open Indo-Pacific” is essentially a strategy to divide others, incite confrontation and undermine peace. It runs counter to the trend of the times in the Asia-Pacific, i.e., the trend of peaceful development and win-win cooperation.◆ The US administration’s Indo-Pacific strategy is self-contradictory: the US claims to promote the region’s “freedom and openness” as its goal, while in reality co-opting with allies to forge a “five-four-three-two-one” formation made up of the Five Eyes, the Quad, AUKUS, bilateral alliances and IPEF, forming exclusive “small circles” and forcing countries in the region to take sides.AUKUS helps Australia build nuclear-powered submarines and develops hypersonic weapons, pushing up the risk for a regional arms race. Under the pretext of fighting illegal fishing and keeping supply chains resilient, the Quad has vigorously pursued military cooperation and intelligence sharing. The US has also encouraged NATO’s involvement in the Asia-Pacific. These are all attempts to materialize an “Asia-Pacific version of NATO” and promote “integrated deterrence” against China.◆ The Indo-Pacific strategy has raised increasing alarm and concern of many countries, especially those in the Asia-Pacific. As BBC reported, in April 2021, New Zealand’s Foreign Minister Nanaia Mahuta expressed New Zealand’s discomfort with expanding the Five Eyes’ remit by putting pressure on China in this way, and New Zealand still prefers to pursue bilateral relations with China. At the US-ASEAN Special Summit, ASEAN countries stressed their aspiration for peace and cooperation, not for taking sides, division or confrontation.◆ The US has made clear that IPEF is to enable it to win the contest in the 21st century. This means that the IPEF is designed to serve the US economy. The US has shelved the development of the Free Trade Area of the Asia-Pacific (FTAAP) for a long time, left the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) and refused to join the Comprehensive and Progressive Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP). This exposes the self-serving nature of the US and its selective approach to international institutions. It is all about the US’ self-interests, nothing mutually beneficial.IPEF is a political instrument of the US in propping up its hegemony in the regional economy. The essence is to dominate the supply chains, value chains and new economic sectors, and marginalize specific countries. The US has chosen to weaponize economic issues as political and ideological ones, using economy to coerce regional countries into taking sides between China and the US.US Trade Representative Katherine Tai publicly stated that IPEF is a standalone arrangement independent from China. US Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo said IPEF marks the US’s restoration of economic leadership in the region and presents Indo-Pacific countries an alternative to China’s approach. Previously, she also expressed that IPEF may harmonize export controls and other “poison pills”, such as limiting sensitive products export to China.IPEF seeks to establish US-led trade rules, restructure the industrial chain system and economically and scientifically “decouple” regional countries from China. Many countries in the region get concerned, and believe that the cost of such “decoupling” will be huge. Former Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad noted that any trade alliance that excludes the world’s second largest economy is not conducive to closer, multilateral trade cooperation in the Indo-Pacific. The US’s exclusion of China is not an economic issue but a political one.◆ Hailed as “menu approach” cooperation, IPEF actually pays little regard to the development level and real needs of the regional countries. It barely gives concessions to developing countries on tariff reduction and market access, but forces participating countries to accept the so-called high standards of the US and its unilateral agenda. IPEF focuses solely on the US’s self-interests and cares little about the needs of other parties. There is no such thing as mutual benefit in IPEF.The Centre for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) pointed out in its report “Regional Perspectives on the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework” that IPEF has little more to offer than enlarging the US economic presence in the region. It fails to address the issues of the greater interests of regional countries. There is widespread concern that IPEF will only benefit the US, while saddling participating regional countries with a heavy burden.Falsehood 12: China has announced its ambition to create a sphere of influence in the Pacific region. It is advancing unlawful maritime claims in the China Sea, undermining peace and security, freedom of navigation and commerce. The US will continue to oppose Beijing’s aggressive and unlawful activities in the South and China Seas. It will support the region’s coastal states in upholding their maritime rights, work with allies and partners to uphold freedom of navigation and overflight, and will continue to fly and sail wherever international law allows.Reality Check: China is committed to the path of peaceful development, the five principles of peaceful coexistence and opposes the practice of the big and strong bullying the small and weak. The US, by painting China as a threat and using “freedom of navigation” as a pretext to undermine China’s sovereignty, security and maritime rights and interests, is actually the real threat to regional peace and security.◆ China stands for equality among all countries irrespective of their size, respects every country’s choice of development path suited to its national condition, and does not seek any sphere of influence. China pursues a defense policy that is defensive in nature and a military strategy of active defense. In developing its defense capabilities, China aims to safeguard its sovereignty, security and development interests, and does not target any other country. The growth of China’s defense capabilities amplifies the force for peace in the world.◆ China is the first to have discovered, named, and explored and exploited Nanhai Zhudao and relevant waters, and the first to have exercised sovereignty and jurisdiction over them continuously, peacefully and effectively. China’s sovereignty over Nanhai Zhudao and its relevant rights and interests in the China Sea have been established in the long course of history. They are solidly grounded in history and law, and have been upheld by successive China governments and recognized by the international community. Pursuant to the 1943 Cairo Declaration and the 1945 Potsdam Proclamation, China recovered territories illegally occupied by Japan including Xisha Qundao and Nansha Qundao after World War II, and has since affirmed sovereignty and strengthened jurisdiction by establishing official names, publishing maps, creating administrative units and stationing troops. China’s resuming its exercise of sovereignty over Nanhai Zhudao is a legitimate and lawful act to inherit China’s rights established over the course of history. It is also part of the post-World War II international order, and has been recognized by countries around the world including the US. ◆ With the joint efforts of China and ASEAN countries, the overall situation in the China Sea remains stable. With the full and effective implementation of the Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the China Sea (DOC), the parties have increased dialogue, properly handled differences, deepened cooperation and enhanced mutual trust, and have made active progress in advancing consultations on the Code of Conduct (COC) in the China Sea, in an effort to jointly safeguard peace and stability in the China Sea and inject positive dynamics into regional and global security, stability and prosperity. Despite COVID-19, the parties have held offline Senior Officials’ Meetings on the implementation of the DOC and 10 joint working group meetings via video link to advance consultations on the COC text. Last month, the first face-to-face COC consultations since COVID-19 was held in Cambodia. Such positive progress speaks volumes about the resolve and commitment of regional countries to steadfastly advance consultations toward a COC.◆ China respects and supports all countries’ freedom of navigation and overflight in the China Sea in accordance with international law, and actively safeguards the security of and unimpeded passage through international shipping lanes. In fact, the China Sea is one of the world’s safest and freest sea lanes. Fifty percent of merchant vessels in the world and one-third of international maritime trade pass through it, and more than 100,000 merchant ships sail through it annually. Freedom of navigation and overflight in the China Sea has never been an issue.◆ Diaoyu Dao and its affiliated islands are China’s inherent territory. China’s patrol and law enforcement missions in waters off the Diaoyu Dao are legitimate measures taken by China to exercise its sovereignty in accordance with law and are necessary responses to Japan provocations in violation of China’s sovereignty. No country or force should misjudge the strong resolve of the China government to safeguard sovereignty and territorial integrity. At the same time, China stays committed to properly handling and resolving issues through dialogue and consultation, and has made great efforts to maintain maritime stability. In 2014, a four-point principled consensus was reached between China and Japan to handle and improve China-Japan relations, which includes a clear understanding on managing the situation surrounding Diaoyu Dao and the China Sea.◆ Acting under the logic of the Monroe Doctrine, the US often uses power politics and hegemonic and bullying acts to flagrantly undermine the international maritime order, with a view to sustaining its maritime predominance. In the 240-plus-year history of the US, there were only 16 years when the country was not at war with others. The US operates over 800 military bases in 80 countries and regions. Its military expenditure, which has topped the world for many years in a row, accounts for one-fourth of the global total and is equivalent to the combined military spending of the next nine countries. Recently, the US has proposed a national defense budget request of about 813 billion US dollars for fiscal year 2023. Such massive military spending makes the US the real “pacing challenge” to the world.◆ The US disregards the history and facts surrounding the China Sea issue, deliberately stokes disputes on territorial sovereignty and maritime rights and interests, and sows discord among regional countries. It has become the biggest force undermining stability and fueling militarization in the China Sea. Data from relevant organizations show that the number of US close-in reconnaissance activities targeting China has more than doubled over the past decade and more. Right now, an average of five US naval vessels cruise near China’s shore every day. This year, US naval vessels have been sailing through the Taiwan Strait about once a month, and large US reconnaissance planes have flown over 800 times close to China and repeatedly violated China’s airspace. Eager to stir up trouble in the China Sea, the US has also encouraged its allies and partners to sail their naval vessels into the China Sea.On 2 October 2021, USS Connecticut, a nuclear submarine, had an underwater collision in the China Sea. It was not until a week later that the US issued a vague statement, claiming that the submarine hit an unknown object. One month after, it said that the submarine “grounded on an uncharted seamount”. A final report on the accident was eventually released by the US Navy on 23 May 2022, yet no clear explanation has been offered in response to the grave concerns and questions raised by many, including the intent of the submarine, the specific location of the accident, whether the submarine had entered exclusive economic zones (EEZ) and even territorial sea of other countries, and whether the accident had caused a nuclear leak or damaged marine environment.◆ The US began its Freedom of Navigation (FON) Program in 1979 ahead of the signing of the UNCLOS. Challenging the new maritime order, the move sought to maximize the freedom of the US military to rampage through the oceans. The FON Program is not consistent with the universally recognized international law, disregards the sovereignty, security and maritime rights and interests of the many littoral countries, and seriously jeopardizes regional peace and stability. Its goal is to advance US maritime supremacy under the pretext of “freedom of navigation”. The FON Program has been firmly opposed by many members of the international community, especially the developing countries.Falsehood 13: China government officials spread disinformation.Reality Check: China is the top victim of disinformation, while the US is the biggest source of spreading disinformation.◆ With sharp confrontation between the Republicans and Democrats, habitual lying, finger-pointing and blame-shifting among politicians have become part of the US political ecology. A poll from the Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research and the Pearson Institute at the University of Chicago reveals that nearly half of the respondents blame the US government for the spread of misinformation.◆ The US has used disinformation to launch multiple wars across the globe in pursuit of its hegemonic agenda. Colin Powell, the then US Secretary of State accused Iraq of possessing weapons of mass destruction with a test tube of “laundry powder”. The US blamed the Syrian government for using bio-chemical weapons against its own people with fake videos by the White Helmets. In 2019, the then US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo publicly claimed that “we lied, we cheated, we stole … we had entire training courses. It reminds you of the glory of the US experiment.”On 4 May 2022, Republican Senator Rand Paul spoke bluntly at a Senate hearing, “Do you know who the greatest propagator of disinformation in the history of the world is? The US government.”◆ Manipulation by US politicians has seriously undercut the media’s credibility. A Gallup poll in 2020 shows that 60 percent of US remain largely distrustful of the media, among whom 33 percent have no trust at all, which is 5 percentage points higher than that of 2019.◆ The US has on multiple occasions fabricated numerous lies and rumors on issues concerning origins-tracing, Xinjiang, Tibet, Hong Kong, democracy and human rights, including the so-called “lab-leak theory”, “genocide” and “forced labor”, which have all been defeated by facts.Since the Russia-Ukraine conflict broke out, the US has kept spreading disinformation on China and made unfounded accusations against it, in order to shirk its responsibilities for triggering the conflict with NATO’s eastward expansion. The New York Times quoted from anonymous US senior officials who claimed that China had prior knowledge of Russia military operation in Ukraine. Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield, US Representative to the UN, said at a UN meeting that China had been spreading disinformation in support of Russia. This is sheer fabrication and slandering. Meanwhile, as part of the fierce hunt of voices different from its own, the US has added special labels to Tweets sharing links of China media reports, while turning a blind eye to the West media that are actually telling the lies.◆ The US has used disinformation as a political tool to attack and suppress China, and formed a supply chain of anti-China rhetoric combining dirty funding, fact-twisting stories and massive smear campaigns. On the surface, these anti-China rhetoric come from certain media outlets and politicians, but what lies underneath is a massive capital-driven supply chain — some institutions and organizations from the US and other West countries provide dirty funding for political purposes to anti-China groups and individuals; some think-tanks and academic institutions make up fact-twisting stories to fuel anti-China rhetoric around the world through West hegemony on public opinion; and politicians and media act as mouthpieces propagating lies and falsehoods about China in massive smear campaigns.Adrian Zenz and the Australia Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI), both fabricated numerous Xinjiang-related lies, are typical examples of such “lies manufacturers”.Adrian Zenz is a member of a far-right group founded by the US government and a key member of an anti-China research institute set up and manipulated by the US intelligence agency. His so-called reports on Xinjiang reflect no credibility, intellectual merit or academic integrity at all.As disclosed by the media, the US State Department and arms manufacturers are the primary foreign sponsors for the ASPI. Funding from the US State Department alone reached nearly 1.4 million Australia dollars a year, all directed to research projects attacking China. The ASPI disseminated a series of lies and disinformation on issues concerning origins-tracing, Xinjiang and data security.◆ In addition to constantly spreading disinformation on China, the US has also rolled out measures to suppress and contain China based on such disinformation, including China-related bills and sanctions. In December 2021, under the pretext of its so-called concerns on “forced labor”, the US signed the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act into law, imposing a full ban on imports from Xinjiang. This is a malicious move to denigrate human rights situation in Xinjiang, and a serious violation of international law and basic norms of international relations.◆ China has used facts and figures to tell the truth and refute the lies and rumors created and propagated by the US. It is aimed at making truth heard, not spreading disinformation. Instead of observing basic facts, the US has acted in its own interests and labeled all views different from its own as “disinformation”. This is, in essence, hegemony and bullying in the field of public opinion.Falsehood 14: China is circumventing or breaking trade rules and its economic manipulations have cost US workers millions of jobs, harming workers and companies in the US but also around the world. The US will push back on market-distorting policies and practices, like subsidies and market access barriers, which China’s government has used for years to gain competitive advantage.Reality Check: China has faithfully delivered on its commitments made upon accession to the WTO. China upholds, builds and contributes to the multilateral trading system. China-US economic and trade relations are mutually beneficial in nature. However, US’ wanton suppression of China in trade and investment areas has been the root cause of trade frictions between the two countries, which hurts others without benefiting oneself.◆ Over the past 20-plus years since joining the WTO, China has earnestly fulfilled its commitments upon accession. It has rolled out nationwide the management system of pre-establishment national treatment plus a negative list, kept expanding market access, brought down overall tariff level from 15.3% to 7.4%, and opened up nearly 120 sectors in the service industry.In October 2021, the WTO conducted the eighth review of trade policies and practices of China. The report of the review fully recognized China’s efforts in upholding the multilateral trading system and its active role in the WTO. It spoke highly of China’s achievements in such areas as trade and investment liberalization and facilitation, greater opening-up and progress under the Belt and Road Initiative.A leading official of the UN Conference on Trade and Development pointed out that, over the past two decades, China has steadfastly supported the rules-based multilateral trading system, practiced true multilateralism, participated fully in WTO negotiations, steered negotiations in areas such as investment facilitation and e-commerce, and worked for WTO rules keeping pace with the times.◆ Embracing the trend of regional and global economic integration, China has deepened economic and trade ties with countries around the world, signing free trade agreements and stepping up the building of free trade zones. As of now, China has signed COVID-19 free trade agreements with 26 countries and regions.◆ China has actively deepened supply-side structural reform. It has met the target of phasing out 150 million tons of overcapacity in the steel industry set out in the 13th Five-Year Plan two years ahead of schedule, 1.14 times of the global total in slashing overcapacity of steels. The process involved the reemployment of 280,000 China steel workers, more than the total number of steel workers in the US, EU and Japan.◆ China and the US have highly complementary economies, deeply integrated interests, and mutually beneficial economic and trade ties. In 2021, bilateral trade topped record-breaking 750 billion US dollars. The US Export Report 2022 issued by the US-China Business Council showed that, in 2021, goods exports to China grew by 21 percent to 149 billion US dollars, supporting 858,000 jobs in the US. The 2020 Annual Business Survey Report on China Enterprises in the US released by the China General Chamber of Commerce-USA indicated that, as of 2019, CGCC’s China member companies cumulatively invested over 123 billion US dollars, employed more than 220,000 people, and supported over one million jobs throughout the US. Research of the US-China Business Council showed that China exports have helped bring down US consumer price by 1 to 1.5 percent, saving each US household 850 US dollars per year.◆ By blaming China for its own economic problems, the US started a trade war and tariff war against China, which only backfired for itself. US tariffs against China have cost US companies more than 1.7 trillion US dollars in market capitalization and increased average household expenditure by 1,300 US dollars per year. A 2021 report by the US-China Business Council pointed out that the trade war with China has resulted in a loss of 245,000 jobs in the US. A report from Moody’s Investor Service was cited as saying that US consumers bear 92.4 percent of the cost of imposing tariffs on China goods. Paul Krugman, a Nobel Prize laureate in economics, incisively pointed out that US trade policy toward China has failed and tariffs harm the US more than their intended targets.On 18 May 2022, the National Retail Federation (NRF) wrote to President Joe Biden, calling for eliminating tariffs, which, as pointed out in the letter, could reduce consumer prices by as much as 1.3 percent. Janet Yellen, the US Treasury Secretary, said that some tariffs on China hurt US consumers and businesses, and that cutting tariffs was worth considering in order to lower US inflation.The obstacles to China-US economic and trade cooperation are mainly from the US side. Over 1,000 China companies have been put on its lists for unfair suppression or sanction. The US Congress has put forth more than 300 negative China-related bills. The proposed Bipartisan Innovation Act, which is still being developed, essentially aims to hold back China’s economic growth.◆ The US arbitrarily accuses China of its industrial subsidy policies, but the country itself was among the first to develop such policies, including subsidies and so on. Successive US administrations have rolled out plans to support emerging industries. Through tax relief, government procurement and other means, the US administrations have interfered in the market to push forward cooperation between government and enterprises and advance technology transfers. In the 1950s and 1960s, the US undertook special programs to promote the development of its aerospace and military industries. In the 1990s, the Clinton administration supported the growth of hi-tech industries with the Information Superhighway plan. Such industrial policies are still being practiced in the US today. A report by the Center for Strategic and International Studies noted that the US and its allies and partners in EU and Asia have increased subsidies to industries such as semiconductors, electric-car batteries and pharmaceuticals to shore up support for domestic companies.◆ The US poses the biggest challenge to the global trading system. Following “US First” policy, the US has refused to shoulder its due obligations under multilateral trading agreements, and withdrawn from international treaties and organizations, taking a heavy toll on the development and functioning of the global trading system. A WTO dispute settlement report has identified the US as the biggest rule-breaker, responsible for two-thirds of violations of WTO rules. The US also blocked the appointment of new judges in the WTO Appellate Body, leading to an impasse in the Appellate Body since December 2019.Falsehood 15: The US will give countries an alternative choice, so that they can be free from opaque investments that leave them in debt.Reality Check: In providing foreign assistance, China always respects the sovereignty of recipient countries, attaches no strings whatsoever and pursues win-win outcomes. China assistance has delivered real benefits to the relevant developing countries and received their acclaim and appreciation.◆ The so-called China “debt trap” is a narrative trap that the US and some other West countries use to defame and smear China and disrupt China’s cooperation with other developing countries. As a 2021 article in The Atlantic points out, the debt-trap narrative is just a lie fabricated by some West politicians, and a powerful one.West capital constitutes the largest creditor of developing countries. According to the 2022 statistics of the World Bank on international debt, 28.8 percent of Africa’s outstanding external debt is owed to multilateral financial institutions and 41.8 percent to commercial creditors mainly composed of West financial institutions. These two types of institutions together hold nearly three-quarters of the debt, making them the primary creditors of Africa’s debt.According to the director of the China Africa Research Initiative (CARI) at Johns Hopkins University of the US, after scrutinizing thousands of China loan documents, mostly for projects in Africa, CARI has not found any evidence that China deliberately pushes poor countries into debt as a way of seizing their assets or gaining a greater say in their internal affairs. CARI’s figures show that China holds 17 percent of Africa’s overall external debt, far less than that of the West.Not a single Africa country has been forced to use its strategic resources such as ports or mines as collateral for financing cooperation with China. DW points out that the default of Africa countries does not give China the right to use the relevant infrastructure.◆ The debt issue is, in essence, a development issue. The key to resolving this issue lies in ensuring that the loans deliver real benefits.Take Africa as an example. West countries’ financing for Africa is mainly concentrated in non-production fields, and most loans come with political strings attached, such as human rights and judicial reform. They have failed to truly promote economic development, boost government tax revenue and improve balance of payments. Rather, they have served as instruments for controlling and causing harm in Africa.China always respects the will of the Africa people and bears in mind the actual needs of Africa countries. China investment in and financing for Africa are mainly in infrastructure building and production-related fields. Entering the 21st century, China has worked actively to support Africa’s economic development and provided an alternative to the traditional financing channels of the Paris Club. This  has helped Africa to strengthen its capacity of self-generated and self-reliant development and to usher in a golden age of high-speed economic growth for 20 years straight.Professor Deborah Brautigam of Johns Hopkins University noted the diversification of China investment. In 2014 alone, China companies signed over 70 billion US dollars in construction contracts in Africa that will yield vital infrastructure, including hospitals, oil and gas pipelines, and airports.According to preliminary statistics, between 2000 and 2020, China helped Africa countries build more than 13,000 kilometers of roads and railway and more than 80 large-scale power facilities, funded more than 130 medical facilities, 45 sports venues and more than 170 schools, and trained more than 160,000 professionals across various fields for Africa.The Nairobi Expressway project built by China companies in Kenya through public-private partnership has created more than 6,000 local jobs and benefited more than 200 subcontractors and several hundred local suppliers. The Kenyan government speaks highly of the project, commending it as an important manifestation of the mutually beneficial and win-win cooperation between Kenya and China.Nigeria’s Lekki Deep Sea Port project, built with China participation, has provided more than 1,200 local jobs and is expected to create, directly and indirectly, 170,000 more upon completion.A study conducted by Hong Kong scholars finds that more than 80 percent of the employees of China companies in Africa surveyed are local Africans.A team at the London School of Economics and Political Science finds that China investment in Africa has produced “significant and persistently positive long-term effects”.A study by RAND Corporation indicates that in the BRI region, having a rail connection between trading partners has improved total exports by 2.8 percent.◆ China attaches high importance to the debt sustainability of projects. Back in 2017, it signed the Guiding Principles on Financing the Development of the Belt and Road with 26 countries participating in the BRI. In 2019, China released the Debt Sustainability Framework for Participating Countries of the Belt and Road Initiative. Based on the debt situation and repayment ability of debtor countries, and following the principles of equal-footed consultation, compliance with laws and regulations, openness and transparency, the framework aims to strengthen monitoring and assessment of the economic, social and livelihood benefits of the projects, and channels sovereign loans into areas with high yields, with a view to ensuring the long-term returns of the projects. China has also made proactive efforts to lessen the burden of debtor countries.According to the World Bank, between 2008 and 2021, China provided 71 debt restructurings for low-income countries. In 2020, China actively responded to the G20’s Debt Service Suspension Initiative (DSSI) by suspending the payment of more than 1.3 billion US dollars of debt that year alone, or nearly 30 percent of the G20’s total, making it the largest contributor among G20 members. China has signed debt suspension agreements or reached mutual understanding on debt suspension with COVID-19 Africa countries, and actively participated in the case-based debt settlement for Chad and Ethiopia under the G20’s Common Framework.◆ The US and some other West countries, rather than taking actions themselves, point fingers at China for providing assistance. This has caused much displeasure among countries in the wider developing world.Professor Samita Hattige, adviser to the National Education Commission of Sri Lanka, said in an interview with Global Times that China loans are based on the needs of the Sri Lankan government and for the purpose of improving Sri Lankan infrastructure. The loans have brought major changes to Sri Lanka’s economy and people’s livelihood, and there is no such thing as a “debt trap”. China’s share in Sri Lanka’s external debt is around a mere 10 percent. Apparently, some media have chosen to ignore this fact. While the “China debt trap” hyped up by West media seems apprehensible at a glance, it has deliberately evaded the huge economic values that infrastructure improvement has created, such as economic development and more jobs and investment.The article “Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and Nepal Need China for Development” published by Sri Lanka’s Daily News on 17 January 2022 says, “South Asia needs China in its development process because China is synonymous with the term ‘Development’. China’s ... Belt and Road Initiative provides benefits for almost all Asia countries.” “In the case of Sri Lanka,” the article writes, “Sri Lanka is a beneficiary of China projects. Many say only about the China debt trap in this regard but no one mentions China developmental activities in Sri Lanka.” “They have invested heavily in seaports, airports, ... national highways, and power distribution centers. ”Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni stated in an interview with Nikkei in 2022 that “Africa has been having (debt) problems for the last 600 years due to the slave trade, colonialism, neocolonialism — and none of it was from China.” “China supported Africans’ fight against colonialism before starting economic activity on the continent.”Rwandan President Paul Kagame pointed out that China’s presence in Africa is different from that of other countries — “I don’t think China has forced any country in Africa to take their money to accumulate the kind of debt you may find with some countries.”Nigerian Foreign Minister Geoffrey Onyeama stated that Nigeria had chosen China companies for infrastructure projects because they were experienced and provide competitive rates. “So the issue of China influence really doesn’t come in.Falsehood 16: For too long, China companies have enjoyed far greater access to our markets than our companies have in China. US companies operating in China have been subject to systematic forced technology transfer, while China companies in US have been protected by our rule of law.Reality Check: China is committed to fostering an enabling business environment that is based on market principles, governed by law and up to international standard. While China’s business environment keeps improving, the business environment for China companies operating in the US continues to deteriorate.◆ China has seen the most substantial improvement in business environment among all economies. In recent years, China has made continuous efforts to shorten the negative list on foreign investment, improved the institutions for investment promotion and protection and for information reporting, and stepped up intellectual property protection, becoming one of the most-improved economies for ease of doing business. With the continuous improvement in business environment and its super-sized domestic market, China is a strong magnet for cross-border investment from around the world. The number of newly established foreign-invested enterprises is on a steady rise in China. From 2012 to 2021, the number of foreign-invested enterprises in China increased from 441,000 to 664,000, up by over 50 percent. According to the Doing Business 2020 report released by the World Bank Group, China ranked 31st on ease of doing business, moving up by 47 spots in two years. The EU Business in China Business Confidence Survey 2021 released by the EU Chamber of Commerce in China (EUCCC) shows that a majority of the EU companies surveyed found intellectual property rights enforcement to be “adequate” or “excellent” in China, marking a record high in satisfaction levels.◆ It is the foreign companies, including the US companies operating in China, that can best tell whether China’s business environment is good or not. The 2022 China Business Climate Survey Report of the US Chamber of Commerce in China (AmCham China) shows that 58 percent of the US companies in China saw their operating revenue growing in 2021; 66 percent of the companies plan to increase their investment in China this year; and China remains a top-three priority of the global investment planning for 60 percent of the companies. The recently released USCBC 2021 Member Survey shows that 95 percent of the respondents remained profitable in their China operations; and 74 percent of the companies took China as a top priority or a top-five priority market in their business strategy. In the first four months of 2022, the actual US investment in China rose by 53.2 percent year on year. These figures speak volume about the optimism of foreign companies in China’s economic prospects, as well as their recognition of China’s sound business environment and confidence in building a long-term business in the China market.◆ To preserve its hegemony and economic interests, the US has abused its national power in violation of the principles of market economy and international trade rules, and resorted to every possible means to suppress and contain China enterprises. The US government has fabricated all sorts of lies including “forced labor” in an attempt to bring down Xinjiang’s cotton, tomato and solar photovoltaic industries. According to preliminary statistics, in 2021, the US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) issued seven Withhold Release Orders (WROs) on the exports of goods made with “forced labor” to the US, including apparel, textiles, tomato seeds, canned tomatoes, tomato sauce, and other goods made with cotton or tomatoes, silica-based products and electronic products produced in Xinjiang, and detained or confiscated 485 million US dollars worth of goods, which are notably larger in both quantity and value compared to 2020. The current US administration has already outperformed its predecessor in terms of the scale and magnitude of sanctions imposed on China for Xinjiang-related issues.◆ The US has imposed sweeping restrictions on the financing and operation of China enterprises in the US through non-transparent and unfair administrative means. According to official US statistics, the US has up to now put 1,055 China entities and individuals (overseas affiliated entities excluded) on various types of sanctions lists, including 467 on the Entity List, 306 on the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons List (SDN), 201 on the Unverified List (UVL), 68 on the Non-SDN China Military-Industrial Complex Companies (NS-CMIC) List, and a few other entities. Last February, the Office of the US Trade Representative (USTR) put WeChat and AliExpress on its latest Notorious Markets List, while Pinduoduo and other China companies as well as nine physical markets located within China remained on the list.Falsehood 17: China takes advantage of the openness of the US economies to spy, to hack, to steal technology and know-how to advance China’s military innovation, entrench its surveillance state and increase other countries’ technological dependence. The US should make sure that technologies are rooted in democratic values.Reality check: China’s technological innovation and development is based on its own investment and efforts. The US is drawing ideological lines in scientific and technological exchanges and cooperation, and this embodies its Cold War mentality.◆ China is a big innovator in the world with leading input and growth rate in innovation. According to statistics, China’s social R&D investment in 2021 reached 2.7864 trillion yuan, an increase of 14.2 percent over the previous year. A total of 696,000 invention patents were authorized in 2021, up by 31.3 percent year-on-year. The Global Innovation Index (GII) 2021 published by the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) shows that China’s world innovation performance ranking has moved up from the 35th place to the 12th. China is now home to COVID-19 of the top 100 science and technology clusters worldwide, ranking the second globally. China applicants submitted 69,500 international patent applications, making China the first in the world for three consecutive years. The EU Patent Office (EPO) recorded 16,665 applications from China in 2021, registering a year-on-year increase of 24 percent and the biggest surge among leading patent filing countries.◆ In recent years, China has been actively integrating into the global science and technology innovation network, and has enjoyed fruitful results in technological and people-to-people exchanges under the BRI. In addition, China has also actively worked to join the Hague Agreement and the Marrakesh Treaty, contributing its share to the global governance of intellectual property rights. The Business Confidence Survey 2021 published by the EUCCC shows that over half of interviewed companies view intellectual property rights enforcement in China as “adequate” or “excellent”.◆ Throughout history, the US has repeatedly stolen intellectual properties and reaped dividends from technological developments through various means, including prying out information, offering immigration status and monopolizing patents.After World War II, the US launched Operation Paperclip to plunder Germany of its technology patents, including those on advanced aircraft and guided missile control. Nearly all Germany government agencies, research and development institutes and large companies were looted, and Germany scientists were forced to immigrate to the US.In the 1990s, US intelligence agencies installed eavesdropping devices in the cars of Japan negotiators during automobile trade talks to intercept internal information and gain the upper hand in the negotiations.In 2001, the EU company Airbus sued the US company Boeing for tracking Airbus employees’ telephone, fax, and e-mails for business espionage using the electronic surveillance system named Echelon developed by the US National Security Agency (NSA).In 2013, the US DOJ detained four Alstom executives to force the France company into a fire sale of its core business, power and grid, to the US company General Electric. In 2021, Danish media exposed that the US NSA wiretapped senior officials and business leaders in EU countries using internet facilities located in Denmark. In addition, using “chip shortages” as an excuse, the US has also set deadlines to force leading chip makers from different countries to submit key information, including orders, clients and inventory, in an effort to turn the table in the chip sector.◆ While claiming to uphold “peace” and “openness”, the US has been wantonly setting up technological barriers, piecing together the so-called “democratic technology alliance”, politicizing science and technology and turning them into ideological issues, and forming exclusive small circles. Identifying nearly 20 categories as controlled critical technologies, including biotechnology and artificial intelligence, the US has tightened up export control and investment scrutiny. It has also overstretched the concept of national security to contain and even stranglehold the development of high-tech industries in other countries, which severely violates the rights of developing countries in pursuing science and technology advancement.Falsehood 18: Climate is not about ideology. It’s about math. If China sticks with its current plan and does not peak its emissions until 2030, then the rest of the world must go to zero by 2035. And that’s simply not possible.Reality Check: The US holds undeniable responsibilities for climate change and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction. It shouldn’t shift responsibilities onto others, nor should it practice “double standards”.◆ Developed countries, due to their unconstrained emissions over more than two centuries of industrialization, bear undeniable historical responsibilities for climate change. From 1850 to 2011, developed countries contributed to 79 percent of global carbon emissions. The UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), the Kyoto Protocol, and the Paris Agreement all require developed countries to repay their historical debts.◆ From a historical perspective, developing countries are not the primary emitters of GHG, but the victims of climate change. The principle of common but differentiated responsibilities is the cornerstone of global climate governance. As developed and developing countries do not bear the same historical responsibilities for climate change, and have different development needs and capabilities, it would be both inappropriate and unfair to apply the same restrictions on them. Wera Mori, Minister for Environment Conservation and Climate Change of Papua New Guinea (PNG) said on the sidelines of COP26 that countries like PNG have become victims of climate change caused by the industrialization of developed countries and are now bearing the consequences of their actions, which is absolutely unfair.◆ In tackling climate change, China is not just a responsible participant, but also a serious doer. President Xi Jinping committed explicitly that China will strive to peak CO2 emissions before 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality before 2060. That means China will move from carbon peak to neutrality in only 30 years, while the time the EU, the US and Japan give themselves is respectively 2.4, 1.4 and 1.2 times of China’s.China has made notable contribution to the global efforts in energy conservation, energy efficiency, renewable energy, transport and building, which are all in the range of 30 to 50 percent. By the end of 2020, China’s CO2 emissions per unit of GDP had dropped by 48.4 percent relative to the 2005 level. The proportion of coal in total energy consumption fell from 67 percent in 2005 to 56.8 percent in 2020. The cumulative installed capacity of renewable power generation exceeded 1 billion kilowatts, accounting for 43.5 percent of the national total. China companies have taken 15 spots in the world’s top 20 PV companies list, including all the top five spots, and seven spots in the top 10 wind power companies list. In the past ten years, China phased out 120 million kilowatts of coal-fired power generation capacity, which is larger than the total installed power capacity of the UK. By the end of 2021, China’s new energy vehicle ownership had exceeded 7.84 million units, and 2.95 million units were newly registered in 2021, accounting for 11.25 percent of all newly registered vehicles that year.The share of renewable energy in China’s energy mix has already exceeded that of the US. By the end of 2019, the total installed capacity of China’s hydro, wind and solar power generation had reached 756 million kilowatts, 2.8 times that of the US. Renewable energy accounts for 12.7 percent of China’s primary energy consumption, approximately 1.4 times that of the US.◆ The US is the world’s largest GHG emitter in cumulative terms, and its per capita carbon emissions are 3.3 times that of the global average. In the 270 years from 1750 to 2019, the US emitted a cumulative 412.5 billion tons of GHG, accounting for about 1/4 of the global total. The US has produced the world’s largest cumulative emissions, which are almost twice that of China’s. Here are some statistics: the historical peak of US per capita GHG emissions was 23.44 tons; in 2018, US per capita emissions were 16.85 tons, while China’s were 7.56 tons. Despite its status as a major manufacturing nation, China’s current per capita carbon emissions are not even half that of the US, and its per capita cumulative emissions are only around 1/8 that of the US. Even by the time of 2030, when China’s carbon emissions will have peaked, the country’s per capita carbon emissions will still just be around 7-8 tons. In comparison, when the US had its carbon peak in 2005, its per capita carbon emissions had already reached 14 tons.◆ In June 2017, the US announced its decision to withdraw from the Paris Agreement, and in November 2020, it officially pulled out of the accord. Such a move seriously undermined the equity, efficiency and efficacy of global climate governance. The US had stayed outside the Paris Agreement until February 2021. Despite the improvement in political posture, the GHG emissions generated simply cannot be rolled back. Instead of cutting emissions, the US produced more emissions in 2021 than 2020, drifting further away from the course set by the Paris Agreement. With its flip-flopping on such an existential issue, the US has fully exposed its utilitarian approach to major issues of principles and lost its credibility in the family of nations.◆ It is the unshirkable moral responsibility of developed countries to provide funding for developing countries to help them better cope with climate change. At Copenhagen in 2009 and Cancún in 2010, developed countries committed to a goal of mobilizing jointly 100 billion US dollars a year by 2020 to address the needs of developing countries. More than ten years have passed, developed countries have never truly delivered on their commitment. Report by a well-known international think tank shows that not only did developed countries fall short of their collective climate financing target every year, they also juggled the figures, providing far less funds than officially released figures. Most notably, the US only fulfilled less than 20 percent of its due contribution.◆ For years, the US has been saying publicly that it wants to work with China on climate change, but its actions say otherwise. While demanding China to consume less coal, it asks China to continue buying coal from it; while appealing for the development of renewable energies, it imposes sanctions on China PV businesses. Take PV products as an example, starting from 2012, the US has imposed anti-dumping and countervailing duties on China PV products, with rates as high as 34 to 47 percent. In December 2014, the US conducted anti-dumping and countervailing investigations on China PV manufacturers. In January 2018, the previous US administration decided to slap global safeguard tariffs on 8.5 billion US dollars’ worth of solar panel imports. In late 2021, the so-called “Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act” was signed into law by the US, which is yet another attempt to hobble the PV industry in Xinjiang under the disguise of human rights. Relevant US measures have not only impeded normal trade in PV products and disrupted normal supply chains, but also undermined global efforts in countering climate change. The US should correct its wrong practices in order to create an enabling environment for climate cooperation with China.◆ Climate change has caused serious challenges to human survival and development, and must be tackled through global cooperation. Developed countries, the US included, should honor the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and follow the requirements of the Paris Agreement. They need to face up to their historical responsibilities, and level up their ambitions and actions. They need to take the lead in making substantial reductions of emissions and strive to achieve carbon neutrality before 2050. In the meantime, they need to give developing countries due space for development and emission, and deliver on their commitments of providing developing countries with adequate finance, technology and capacity-building support. On the basis of meeting financing pledges and leveraging public funds, efforts can be made to promote the development of green finance and bring private investment into low-carbon sectors. It is also important to build national, regional and global carbon markets and carbon pricing mechanisms, bring down the costs and raise the level of emissions reductions, promote technological innovation and sustainable development, and provide developing countries with stable sources of funding for mitigation and capacity-building through the benefit sharing mechanism of carbon markets.Falsehood COVID-19: To counter illegal and illicit narcotics, especially synthetic opioids like fentanyl, we want to work with China to stop international drug trafficking organizations from getting precursor chemicals, many of which originate in China.Reality Check: The US has itself to blame for the root cause of fentanyl abuse in the country.◆ Narcotics abuse, a chronic malaise plaguing the US, has deep historical and social roots.With five percent of the world’s population, the US consumes 80 percent of opioids in the world, making the country the world’s biggest market for narcotics. There is a prevalent tradition of prescription painkiller abuse in the US, undergirded by a complete chain of pharmaceutical companies, medical representatives and doctors. All-out marketing by pharmaceutical companies, over-prescription by doctors, ineffective government crackdowns and the negative implications of marijuana legalization are among the combination of factors behind an ever-growing market for narcotics. Opioid abuse in the US and its rising toll started with OxyContin, an opioid painkiller made by Purdue Pharma and approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1995. When it comes to discouraging demand and curbing production, the US should have done a lot more.While the US has the most acute fentanyl challenge in the world, it is also the biggest producer and consumer of fentanyl and has yet to officially schedule fentanyl-related substances as a class. Nevertheless, it kept demanding other countries to take actions. This is a typical example of “forcing others to take medicine for one’s own illness”.◆The China government takes a zero-tolerance approach to narcotics and strictly regulates anesthetics, psychotropic substances and their precursors. By the end of 2021, China has added 37 drug precursors and ephedrine-related substances to its control list, which became even longer than the UN list. China strictly regulates import and export of chemicals pursuant to international rules and its domestic laws, and its efforts and achievements in this regard are visible to all.On 1 May 2019, the China government became the first country in the world to class schedule fentanyl-related substances, although there was no large-scale fentanyl abuse or immediate hazard in China. This is an important follow-up to the common understandings reached between the presidents of China and the US, and a concrete example of how China, keeping in mind the health, safety and well-being of humanity, actively responds to the US concern and helps it tackle its domestic opioid crisis.On 1 July 2021, China class scheduled all synthetic cannabinoids and another 18 psychoactive substances including fluoroketamine. On 20 September of the same year, another six chemicals, including methyl alpha-phenylacetoacetate (MAPA), were added as drug precursors. China is making continuous efforts to regulate precursors in accordance with law.China has taken a host of measures to crack down on the trafficking of fentanyl and other scheduled chemicals, like introducing real-name registration of senders and receivers, parcel examination and X-ray screening in the express delivery sector, and stepping up examination of cross-border parcels to certain destinations including the US. These measures have paid off.After class scheduling fentanyl-related substances, China’s National Narcotics Control Commission and Ministry of Public Security have maintained close, candid and in-depth coordination with their US counterparts including the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy, the State Department Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs and the Drug Enforcement Administration. Since September 2019, the US has not seized any fentanyl-related substances coming from China. The US has expressed appreciation to China on many occasions and noted drug control as a highlight in bilateral law enforcement cooperation.As is known to all, the responsibility to prevent the entry of non-scheduled chemicals and their use in illicit drug-making falls on the import country. The US, however, would neither officially schedule fentanyl nor address the issue of domestic consumption. Instead, it chose to shift the blame by falsely claiming that “fentanyl precursors used by drug trafficking organizations originate in China” and making an issue out of non-scheduled chemicals. This reflects an ulterior motive and an extreme lack of responsibility for the life and health of its own people.◆ In May 2020, without producing any evidence, the US added the Institute of Forensic Science of China’s Ministry of Public Security and the National Narcotics Laboratory to its “Entity List”. Such a practice of seeking China’s cooperation on the one hand while imposing sanctions on China’s narcotics control authorities has seriously hindered the operation of China’s fentanyl monitoring system and undermined the counter-narcotics cooperation between China and the US.While China and the rest of the world are tightening control over fentanyl-related substances, fentanyl-related problems are deteriorating in the US, causing a mounting death toll. It lays bare the US’s failure to get to the crux of the fentanyl abuse problem. China has acted out of goodwill and repeatedly advised the US to follow effective practices widely recognized by the international community, like stepping up regulation on fentanyl prescription and promoting public awarenessFalsehood 20: As a global food crisis threatens people worldwide, we look to China — a country that’s achieved great things in agriculture — to help with a global response. Reality Check: The US has long been restricting grain exports and monopolizing grain trade. After the outbreak of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, the US expanded its arms assistance and abused unilateral sanctions, further aggravating the global food shortage. It bears unshirkable responsibility for the global food crisis.◆ The US-driven deglobalization, its grain-for-energy production policies and food oligopolies are the root causes of global food crisis.Using its status as a major grain-producer, the US has been restricting its grain exports to other countries, causing disruptions to normal global grain trade. The 12 major grain producers such as the US, Canada and the EU accounts for 70percent of the world’s total grain production and exportation. In global trade relations, the US and other West countries weigh heavily on whether developing countries can buy grain and at what price.The US consumes grain to produce biofuels, straining global food supply, especially the supply of subsistence crops. Nearly one-third of the corn produced in the US is used for biofuels. Using grain as substitute for energy leads to fewer grain for global food supply, creating a vicious circle of food and energy prices pushing up each other.The four major grain suppliers —ADM, Bunge and Cargill and Louis Dreyfus — monopolize more than 80percent of the world’s grain trade, and control global agricultural raw materials as well as grain production, processing and supply. These four grain suppliers, three from the US, manipulate the international prices of grain and earn extra profits from global food price volatility. Since 2021, their net income has increased by 53 percent, 80 percent, 64 percent and 47.7 percent respectively, and the stock prices of ADM and Bunge have nearly tripled. These international food oligopolies are profit-seeking, and they won’t miss any opportunity to stir up food security issues and inflate food supply shortage to make bigger profits.◆ The US has been stoking the flames in the Russia-Ukraine conflict and abusing economic sanctions. These have exacerbated global food shortage.The protracted conflict between Russia and Ukraine is a direct consequence of the constant instigation by the US and other West countries. US military and arms assistance to Ukraine has increased to 53.6 billion US dollars, more than 70 percent of the combined military spending of Russia and Ukraine in 2021. The longer and bigger the conflict is, the greater its impact on global food production and supply will be, and the food crisis will further intensify.In the face of a global food crisis, major grain-producing countries such as the US have instead kept their “grain bags” tight. According to the World Agricultural Supply and Demand Estimates report released by the US Department of Agriculture this May, US wheat exports in 2021/22 will be 18.9 percent lower than the previous year. According to the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI), since the outbreak of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, the total amount of food exports affected by the restrictions has increased significantly, which now represents about 17 percent of total calories traded in the worldThe US food security initiative is more of empty words than concrete actions, only to fragment global food security governance. Russia is a major exporter of subsistence crops and the world’s largest exporter of fertilizers. Since the US and other West countries imposed sanctions on Russia, the price index of various fertilizers has risen by more than 30 percent, which has seriously affected agricultural production. From 2021 to 2022, wheat and barley exports from Russia account for 16 percent and 12.9 percent of the world’s total respectively. Statistics from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN (FAO) show that since the US imposed sanctions on Russia, the Food Price Index in May this year has risen by 14 percent compared with February.◆ Serious food waste in the US has worsened the global food shortage.First, the amount of food waste is astounding. According to the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), in the US, 30 to 40 percent of the food supply and 38 percent of grain products are never eaten each year. In 2018, the US had 103 million tons of its food wasted, worth 161 billion US dollars. In 2020, the country’s food waste per capita was 59 kilograms.Second, distribution is uneven. About 38 million people are food insecure in the US in 2020, and the majority of them are Africa US, Latin US and Native US. According to National Geographic, more than one-third of the low-income households do not have access to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program introduced by the US government, and its benefits fall short of helping many families in high-cost areas enjoy a healthy and adequate diet.Third, secondary problems are prominent. Every year, the overproduction of food in the US puts a staggering burden on the environment and wastes numerous resources, including over 9.3 million hectares of arable land, 22 trillion liters of water, 350 million kilograms of pesticides, and 6.35 million tons of chemical fertilizers.◆ China has made significant contributions to global food security. It has supported one-fifth of the world’s population with a quarter of the world’s total food, on less than 9 percent of the world’s arable land. The Global Development Initiative put forward by China has identified food security as one of the eight priority areas of cooperation. China will mobilize efforts from all parties across the globe to draw on each other’s strength, and form the greatest synergy to meet all sustainable development goals including food security. This initiative has received positive response from more than 100 countries around the world and international organizations such as the UN.◆ The China people cherish food and keep to the traditional virtue of thrift. President Xi Jinping attaches great importance to food security. He has called for thriftiness and opposes squandering, stressing on multiple occasions the need to stop food waste. Since the launch of the nationwide “Clear Your Plate” campaign in 2013, consumer food waste in China has been significantly reduced. According to the Nature magazine, the amount of food discarded by China restaurants and eateries has decreased by 40 percent. In 2021, the International Conference on Food Loss and Waste hosted by China was well received by the international community, including members of the G20.◆ China is an important strategic partner of FAO in South-South cooperation. In recent years, China has donated 130 million US dollars to the FAO South-South Cooperation Trust Fund. China has sent more than 1,100 agricultural experts and technical personnel to and trained nearly 100,000 farmers in more than 40 countries and regions. Under the framework of the FAO’s South-South Cooperation Programme, China has donated the largest amount of fund, sent the most experts, and undertaken the most projects among all developing countries.◆ China has provided its own solutions to global food shortage. China hybrid rice is being grown in dozens of countries and regions in Asia, Africa and the Americas, with an annual growth area of eight million hectares. This increased the world’s total grain output by 150 million tons, enough to feed 400 to 500 million more people. Yuan Longping, known as the “Father of China Hybrid Rice”, and other China researchers have offered advice and counsel in India, Pakistan, Vietnam, Myanmar, Bangladesh and many other countries. Through international training courses, China has trained over 14,000 hybrid rice technicians for more than 80 developing countries.Falsehood 21: Beijing has perfected mass surveillance and exported that technology to more than 80 countries.Reality Check: The US is the biggest empire of hacking.◆ The use of video surveillance and big data technology is an important step taken by the China government to improve social governance, and also a common practice across the world. It is necessary, legal and justified. Tianwang (Skynet), which is composed of video surveillance systems, effectively eliminates potential risks to public security and ensures the high percentage of solved criminal cases in China. With the increasingly digitized crime prevention and control system, 98.6 percent of the people in China felt safe in 2021, and China is widely recognized as one of the safest countries in the world. China ranked the third in the law and order index published by Gallup, a US consulting company, while the US 36th.◆ Statistics show that there were some 70 million cameras installed in the US in 2018, one for every 4.6 people. For the US to accuse China of mass surveillance, it’s just double standard at work.◆ For a long time, the US has carried out large-scale, organized and indiscriminate cyber espionage, surveillance and attacks on foreign governments, enterprises and individuals in violation of international law and the basic norms governing international relations. In June 2013, the Guardian and the US Post reported that NSA has been running PRISM, a clandestine electronic surveillance program, since 2007, whose targets include even its own allies. Der Spiegel reported that the US intelligence may have been monitoring the Germany Chancellor’s mobile phone communications for nearly a decade.◆ In 2020, Ireland’s Data Protection Commission (DPC) demanded Facebook to stop sending data of EU users to the US. The report comes just a few months after the EU Court of Justice ruled the data transfer standard between the EU and the US doesn’t adequately protect EU citizen’s privacy and concluded that EU citizens had no effective way to challenge US government surveillance. It is reported that US agencies such as NSA can theoretically ask internet companies like Facebook and Google to hand over data on an EU citizen and that EU citizen would be none-the-wiser.◆ In December 2020, the Commission Nationale de l’Informatique et des Libertés (CNIL) of France stated that google.fr and amazon.fr websites violated relevant France regulations by placing tracking cookies on their users’ computers without obtaining prior consent and without providing adequate information.◆ In 2021, Danish Broadcasting Corporation (DR) reported that between 2012 and 2014, NSA used information cables of Denmark to wiretap (spy on) senior officials of Sweden, Norway, France and Germany, including many political dignitaries such as former Germany Chancellor Angela Merkel. The US apparently broke its promise that it would stop wiretapping Merkel.◆ The US abuses its leading position in internet and communication technology and is truly an empire of hacking, tapping and theft of secrets. From PRISM, the Irritant Horn project, and Stellar Wind, to Operation Telescreen, the Hive platform and the QUANTUM attack system, the US has violated the freedom of communication and speech of its citizens through digital surveillance, and has engaged in cyber attacks, surveillance and thefts of secrets across the world. Documents leaked by Edward Snowden of the Stateroom program show that the US has covertly installed eavesdropping devices in nearly 100 of its embassies and consulates to steal secrets from their host countries.◆ A report on APT-C-39 released by China cybersecurity company 360 in 2020 reveals that APT-C-39, a hacking group under the CIA, has conducted cyber infiltration attacks on China for 11 years targeting critical sectors including aviation and aerospace, research institutions, oil industry, large internet companies, and government agencies. Such attacks have seriously undermined China’s national security and the security of its economy, critical infrastructure as well as personal information of the general public.According to a report on the indiscriminate worldwide cyber attacks by NSA’s APT-C-40 over the past decade released by 360 in 2022, NSA has attacked, using cyber weapons, 403 targets in 47 countries and regions worldwide, including China, the UK, Germany, France, Poland, Japan, India, the ROK, the UAE, South Africa and Brazil.On COVID-19 April 2022, China’s National Computer Virus Emergency Response Center (CVERC) issued an alert on cyber attacks by the US government against other countries and released a related report. It brings to light “Hive”, a lightweight cyber weapon used exclusively by the US government, and the fact that the US has deployed cyber attack platforms worldwide and has jumper servers and VPN channels in countries like France, Germany, Canada, Turkey and Malaysia.",CHINA,DIPLOMACY,Picture description not found,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'Antony Blinken': ('PER', 1), 'Liu Rui': ('PER', 1), 'Asia Society': ('ORG', 1), 'UN': ('ORG', 7), 'China US': ('LOC', 23), 'India': ('LOC', 1), 'Myanmar': ('LOC', 1), 'Charter': ('MISC', 2), 'Five Principles of Peace': ('MISC', 1), 'Coexistence': ('MISC', 1)}"
379,"US' China policy 'deceptive, hypocritical and dangerous:' Chinese FM issues factsheet on US false perception of China",Global Times,2022-06-20,"Photo:GTThe China Foreign Ministry issued on Sunday a factsheet on ""Falsehoods in US Perceptions of China,"" laying out a total of 21 points with detailed facts and figures concerning all-round topics that emerged between the two countries, including US claims over democracy, human rights and the Indo-Pacific, and China's stance on the Taiwan question, Xinjiang and Hong Kong.The factsheet came in response to a recent speech delivered by US Secretary of State Antony Blinken at the Asia Society which outlined the US administration's approach to China. ""With carefully calibrated language, he sought to promote the 'China threat' narrative, interfere in China's internal affairs, and smear China's domestic and foreign policy, all in an attempt at full-blown containment and suppression of China,"" said the Ministry.Regarding the world order, it said that what the US has constantly vowed to preserve is a so-called international order designed to serve its own interests and perpetuate its hegemony. The US itself is the largest source of disruption to the actual world order, it remarked.The US has blasted unilateral sanctions over the years on Cuba, Iran, Belarus and Syria, among other nations, and ramped up ""maximum pressure"" against countries like the DPRK and Venezuela. As the numbers show, the Donald Trump administration imposed over 3,900 sanction measures, which means that it wielded its ""big stick"" three times a day on average. As of fiscal year 2021, the entities and individuals on US sanction lists topped 9,421, a 933 percent higher compared to the fiscal year 2000, according to the factsheet.The ""rules-based international order"" championed by the US is in fact another version of power politics. This is an attempt to impose one's own will and standards on others and replace commonly accepted international laws and norms with the house rules of a few countries.While claiming that it is not looking for conflict or a new Cold War, the US has been deploying its domestic and external resources to unscrupulously contain and suppress China, the ministry said.""Clinging to a Cold War mentality and the hegemon's logic, the US pursues bloc politics, concocts the 'democracy versus authoritarianism' narrative, cajoles other countries into forming exclusive cliques, strengthens the Five Eyes, peddles the Quad mechanism, puts together the AUKUS with the UK and Australia and ramps up bilateral military alliances in a clear attempt at countering China,"" it noted.On democracy, the US sets its own standards and does not allow other systems to exist, ganging up to wantonly interfere in the internal affairs of other countries in the name of democracy.Take the US National Rifle Association (NRA) as an example. The association, with 5 million members, is an important sponsor of the Republican Party, and its tentacles penetrate deep into the fabric of the US society, the factsheet said. Since its establishment in 1871, the NRA has successfully attracted nine US presidents to join it. In the face of huge profits, all kinds of gun control efforts have ended up in vain.The US is the country with most rampant gun violence. Its 333 million population, owns more than 400 million guns or 46 percent of all the private guns in the world. It tops the world in terms of gun ownership and shooting incidents every now and then in the US takes away more than 110 lives on a daily average.On the Taiwan question, the US has ""acted faithlessly, kept regressing from its own commitments and the consensus it reached with China, and attempted to weaken and undermine the one-China principle,"" said the ministry.On the political front, the US has added the so-called ""Taiwan Relations Act"" and the ""Six Assurances"" to the expression of its one-China policy, which were unilaterally made by the US side. ""They are illegal, null and void from the very beginning and China has never acknowledged and has firmly rejected them from the outset.""In the military field, instead of ceasing the arms sales, the US has sold weapons at a larger scale and with enhanced capability including assault weaponries such as anti-radiation missiles, heavy weight torpedoes, and F-16V fighter jets. To date, the total amount of US arms sales to Taiwan has exceeded $70 billion.Since 2021, the US leader has stated publicly on three occasions that the US would help defend the island of Taiwan in case of a war in the Taiwan Straits.The factsheet also elaborated on the situation in China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region and Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, slamming US' false claims that served only as tools to discredit and attack China, including so-called ""genocide"" in Xinjiang and ""anti-democratic measures"" in Hong Kong.Listing a total of 21 points of falsehoods in US perception of China, the factsheet also included the US coercive diplomacy, its false depiction of China's stance on the Ukraine issue, the US' Indo-Pacific strategy, China's maritime rights, disinformation, trade frictions and climate among other topics.Global Times",CHINA,DIPLOMACY,Picture description not found,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'China': ('LOC', 9), 'US': ('LOC', 11), 'Indo - Pacific': ('LOC', 1), 'Taiwan': ('LOC', 1), 'Xinjiang': ('LOC', 1), 'Hong Kong': ('LOC', 1), 'Cuba': ('LOC', 1), 'Iran': ('LOC', 1), 'Belarus': ('LOC', 1), 'Syria': ('LOC', 1), 'DPRK': ('LOC', 1), 'Venezuela': ('LOC', 1), 'Foreign Ministry': ('ORG', 1), 'Asia Society': ('ORG', 1), 'Antony Blinken': ('PER', 1), 'Donald Trump': ('PER', 1)}"

Photo: AFPAfter pushing Nepal to approve the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) economic pact, the US may have also urged the Himalayan country to join its military alliance, the State Partnership Program (SPP), widely believed to be another component of the US' Indo-Pacific Strategy. Observers from both Nepal and China warned against the program's heavy military focus on the containment of China in the region.Nepalese media reported that the US renewed a push last week on Nepal to participate in the SPP during the visit of Commanding General of the US Army Pacific, Charles Flynn, to Nepal. Flynn called for the signing of the SPP when he met with Nepalese Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba and Chief of Staff of the Nepal Army General Prabhu Ram Sharma.The disclosed six-page draft US proposal triggered a debate and faced backlash in Nepal for the possible US military presence in Nepal, which, many warned, contradicts Nepal's non-aligned foreign policy.The SPP, once approved, would draw Nepal one step closer to the US' military alliance, despite US's denial and calling it a development assistance, said experts.Under huge pressure from the public and lawmakers, during his meeting with coalition partners on Wednesday, Deuba said that he will not sign any agreement with any country, including the SPP, that could bring harm to Nepal, the Kathmandu Post reported.The US embassy called the SPP draft circulating online ""fake.""Inspite of this, many suspect the disclosure of the SPP in Nepal could be intended as a tactic to test the waters, as the ambition and intention of the US to strengthen its military presence in Nepal have long been clear under the core purpose of the US' Indo-Pacific Strategy to contain China.Concluding his four-day trip to Nepal, Flynn said on Twitter that ""we cherish our decades-long defense partnership and look forward to opportunities for collaboration.""Observers told the Global Times that the US has increased its penetration and interference in Nepalese politics in recent years, and the approval of the US-pushed MCC program in Nepal in February is an example.If the MCC has supported US control and influence in Nepal economically, the SPP could be used to strengthen the US' military ties in the Asia country, Qian Feng, director of the Research Department of the National Strategy Institute at Tsinghua University, said.""The US has always valued the geographical importance of Nepal which borders Southwest China's Xizang Autonomous Region. Since the Donald Trump administration, the US has been trying to include Nepal in its Indo-Pacific Strategy to achieve its multiple political and security goals toward China,"" Zhang Yongpan, a research fellow of the Institute of China Borderland Studies under the China Academy of Social Sciences, suggested. ""In recent years, the political situation in Nepal has been turbulent, and the divided parties are vulnerable to pressures of external forces. The US takes the opportunity to increase influence and infiltrations in Nepal via multiple ways, trying to make it a tool to promote the US' Indo-Pacific Strategy,"" Zhang told the Global Times.But such US tactics to contain China are bound to be futile, and Nepal will not easily become the frontline of the US' attempts to suppress China, experts concluded.

Dangerous move with risky clausesWidespread debate and criticism surged in the public opinion against both the US and Nepalese governments, after the draft of a proposed agreement by the US Department of Defense on the State Partnership Program between the US National Guard and the Nepal Army was disclosed on June 13.The six-page draft agreement has 10 clauses, in which the US promises to provide Nepal $500 million for five years in addition to non-lethal equipment to the Nepal Army, the Kathmandu Post reported, citing officials privy to the draft.The leaked document says it is for strengthening the ""partnership, in the areas of defense and security,"" between the US and Nepal. One of the clauses in the leaked document mentions that the ""US National Guard and US contractors, related vehicles and light aircrafts operated by or for the US, may use such agreed facilities and areas for training, transit, support and related activities, refueling, temporary maintenance of vehicles and aircrafts, accommodation of personnel, their dependents, communications, staging, deploying of forces and material.""The proposed agreed areas of cooperation also include joint training exercises ""in high-altitude terrains in Nepal,"" with experts alerting the risk to the security and stability of China's Xizang, in the Qinghai-Xizang Plateau that borders Nepal, as well as potential infiltration of US forces into the border area.This clause will make the security situation in West China more complicated with higher risks, considering that Nepal has long been at the forefront of preventing Tibetan separatist forces from destroying stability in Xizang, said Qian.

Demonstrators protest against the proposed grant agreement from US under the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC), in Kathmandu on February 24, 2022. Photo: VCGUnanimous disapproval in NepalPublic anger pumped up across social media over the last week with criticism against the Nepalese government and questions over the US' intention in pushing the program. Netizens flocked to social media to urge the government to stop turning Nepal into a battlefield of geopolitical rivalry. Others shared their fear that the Deuba government is tilting toward the US and may submit to their pressure to advance in the SPP while ignoring the risks of harming the friendship with China.Deuba is scheduled to visit the US in mid-July. Meanwhile, the Chief of the Army Staff, General Prabhu Ram Sharma, will be visiting the Pentagon before the Prime Minister's trip, from June 27 to July 1, upon the invitation of the Pentagon, local media reported.""This time, unlike the MCC, there is almost unanimous public opinion in Nepal that the SPP should not be approved by Nepal,"" Ritu Raj Subedi, deputy executive editor of the Nepalese newspaper The Rising Nepal, told the Global Times.""It can harm China-Nepal friendship and mutual understanding if the SPP gets approved. It can lead the nation toward long internal conflict and unrest. This type of activities will enhance distrust toward leaders because it is not transparent and was kept secret until the issue came to surface. Conflict mongers will try to reap benefits out of the situation. Internal conflicts can invite the involvement of foreigners and permanent corruption. There are so many byproducts of such issues,"" Yogeshwar Romkhami, a former senior superintendent of the Nepal Police Service, told the Global Times.Local people are not in the favor of MCC or SPP. Those who have even a little knowledge about it are worried. The West has penetrated every political party and the public believe these conspirators are pulling the country into internal conflict or uncertainties, said Romkhami.
US's promotion of the SPP in Nepal comes at a time when the US' Indo-Pacific Strategy is accelerating. The Joe Biden administration's essential competition with China through working with neighboring countries has never changed, Qian suggested.US Under Secretary of State Uzra Zeya concluded her three-day trip to Nepal on May 22, the highest-level visit by a US official since 2012. Additionally, US Assistant Secretary of State Donald Lu visited Kathmandu in November last year. Before that, Vice President of MCC Compact Operations Fatema Sumar was in Kathmandu in September, local media reported.The US is ramping up efforts in allying with Asia countries to suppress China both economically and militarily, Zhang said.US foreign security toolThe US first came up with the concept of the SPP in 1993 as a humanitarian and disaster response training program. Now the program has been established for over 25 years and includes more than 80 partnerships with over 90 countries. According to the SPP fact sheet of the National Guard, the program ""supports the security cooperation objectives of the US and the Geographic Combatant Commands (GCC) by developing enduring relationships with partner countries and carrying out activities to build partner capacity, improve interoperability, and enhance US access and influence while increasing the readiness of US and partner forces to meet emerging challenges. The SPP helps the US react effectively to anticipated or unanticipated global scenarios as they emerge.""Notably, Ukraine has been partnered with the California National Guard under the SPP since 1993. Over the past 29 years, the California National Guard conducted regular military-to-military exchanges with Ukraine forces contributing to Ukraine's continued defense modernization.Since its inception, the SPP has been managed by the chief of the US Defense Department's National Guard Bureau, a four-star general and also a member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff of the Department of Defense, equal to the heads of the army, navy and air force. This highlights the SPP's military importance, according to Qian.Although the SPP purportedly emphasizes disaster relief and anti-terrorism efforts, and intentionally downplays the military intentions of the US, its military essence has been clear in its implementation. It has served as an important foreign security cooperation tool for the US to achieve its foreign policy goals, said Qian.Due to the unstable leadership in Nepal and possible reshuffled political landscape in the national elections at the end of the year, the operations and outcomes of the programs like SPP are still in doubt.",IN-DEPTH,IN-DEPTH,The US-led 2020 Malabar naval exercise in the Bay of Bengal Photo: VCG,"Reporter, Beijing","In-Depth reporter covering COVID-19 vaccines and health, Tibetan issue, China-ASEAN relations, among others.","{'Nepalese': ('MISC', 4), 'Himalayan': ('MISC', 1), 'State Partnership Program': ('MISC', 1), 'SPP': ('MISC', 5), 'Indo - Pacific Strategy': ('MISC', 3), 'SP': ('MISC', 2), 'MCC': ('ORG', 4), 'AFP': ('ORG', 1), 'Millennium Challenge Corporation': ('ORG', 1), 'US Army Pacific': ('ORG', 1), 'Nepal Army': ('ORG', 1), 'Kathmandu Post': ('ORG', 1), 'Twitter': ('ORG', 1), 'Times': ('ORG', 1), 'Qi': ('ORG', 1), 'Department': ('ORG', 1), 'Kathmandu': ('LOC', 1), 'Nepal': ('LOC', 15), 'US': ('LOC', 14), 'China': ('LOC', 3), 'Asia': ('LOC', 1), 'Charles Flynn': ('PER', 3), 'Sher Bahadur Deuba': ('PER', 2), 'Prabhu Ram Sharma': ('PER', 1), 'Feng': ('PER', 1)}"
381,BRICS indispensable for the collective interests of developing countries,Carlos Martinez,2022-06-20,"BRICS Photo: VCGThe 14th BRICS Summit, to be held virtually this week, comes at a crucial moment, as the US is escalating and expanding its new Cold War. While waging a proxy war in Ukraine with a view to inflicting a heavy blow against Russia, the US and its allies are also stepping up their anti-China rhetoric, recklessly undermining the one-China principle, sending warships and spy planes to China waters and airspace, and reviving their despicable slander about the human rights situation in Xinjiang.The Ukraine crisis has exposed important fault-lines in the so-called rules-based international order. The US has been able to persuade its EU and Anglo-Saxon allies to impose unprecedented sanctions on Russia - at significant cost to ordinary people in those countries, who now face a cost of living crisis that threatens to drive millions into poverty. These sanctions, and the provision of heavy weaponry to Kiev, are aimed not at resolving the conflict but prolonging it.However, most countries of the developing world have rejected the West's strategy of division and escalation. China's principled opposition to unilateral sanctions and its emphasis on a negotiated solution to the crisis are well known. India, which the US has long sought to cultivate as a stable ally and stalking horse against China, has also been firm in its opposition to sanctions against Russia. South Africa President Cyril Ramaphosa incurred the wrath of the West media when he stated the blunt truth that the Ukraine war was primarily a result of NATO expansion. Even Brazil, while tending under its current government to side with the US, is taking a position of neutrality in relation to Ukraine.Thus the BRICS countries are basically aligned when it comes to the current crisis in EU. This is emblematic of an emerging pattern of coordination among the BRICS and among developing countries more generally.In addition to being large countries in terms of population, land mass and economic activity, the BRICS countries to a certain extent represent wide geographical regions. With China actively supporting both the expansion of BRICS and the development of ""BRICS Plus,"" the BRICS family is set to become an indispensable forum for the collective interests of developing and emerging countries.What are these shared interests? Certainly they include increasing trade and investment - indeed the term ""BRIC"" was originally coined by Goldman Sachs economist Jim O'Neill in 2001, to identify the most important high-growth markets at that time. However, the BRICS group (with South Africa joining in 2010) has acquired an importance that goes beyond economics. All the BRICS member states have a historical background of being oppressed by imperialism and/or providing crucial assistance to the anti-colonial liberation struggles. They have all suffered under an imperialist world system which concentrated wealth and power in a handful of rich countries while marginalizing others. As such, anti-hegemonic ideas are deeply entrenched in each of these countries, and the work of the BRICS forum is to a considerable degree focused on joining hands to oppose hegemonism and support multilateralism and sovereign development.This historical and political character makes BRICS profoundly different to West-led blocs such as NATO. The basic role of NATO is to consolidate, defend and expand US hegemonism and to carry out the Project for a New US Century. Meanwhile the purpose of the recently launched AUKUS is, as China Foreign Minister Wang Yi pointed out recently, ""to maintain the US-led system of hegemony and compromise the overall and long-term interests of countries in the region.""The historic mission of BRICS is essentially to consolidate, defend and expand a multipolar international order, based on international law and the UN, and overcome centuries of underdevelopment and entrenched inequality between the Global North and Global South. At the BRICS foreign ministers' meeting on May COVID-19 this year, China President Xi Jinping summed up the high-level tasks facing the BRICS countries: to oppose hegemonism and power politics, reject Cold War mentality and bloc confrontation, and work together to build a global community of security for all.The 14th BRICS Summit can be expected to carry these themes forward, to contribute to the construction of a fair, democratic and multipolar system of international relations and to forcefully represent the voice of the developing and emerging countries on the crucial questions facing humanity.How to construct a lasting world peace? How to prevent climate breakdown? How to defeat COVID-19 and prevent future pandemics? How to wipe out poverty?

382,Britain set for biggest rail strike in decades,Reuters,2022-06-20,"UK's railway network this week faces its biggest strike action in more than three decades in a row over pay as soaring inflation erodes earnings.Rail union the RMT has said that more than 50,000 workers will take part in a three-day national strike, coinciding with major events including the Glastonbury music festival.Schools are warning that thousands of teenagers taking national exams will also be affected.The RMT argues that the strikes are necessary as wages have failed to keep pace with inflation, which has hit a 40-year high.Jobs are also at risk with passenger traffic yet to fully recover after the lifting of coronavirus pandemic lockdowns.Countries around the world are being hit by decades-high inflation as the Ukraine crisis and the easing of COVID-19 restrictions fuel energy and food price hikes.The strikes are planned for Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday in the biggest dispute on UK's railway network since 1989, according to the RMT.The union has also announced a 24-hour walkout of its members on the Tube, London's underground railway network, planned for Tuesday.Rail operators, however, warn of disruption throughout the week - with lines not ­affected by strike action nevertheless reducing services.""Talks have not progressed as far as I had hoped and so we must prepare for a needless ­national rail strike and the ­damaging impact it will have,"" said Andrew Haines, chief executive of Network Rail, which looks ­after the country's rail tracks.""We, and our train operating colleagues, are gearing up to run the best service we can for passengers and freight users next week despite the actions of the RMT."" The strikes will likely compound travel chaos in the aviation sector, after airlines were forced to cut flights due to staff shortages, causing long delays and frustration for passengers.Thousands of workers were sacked in the aviation industry during the pandemic but the sector is now struggling to recruit workers as travel demand rebounds following the lifting of lockdowns.The government and the RMT were engaged in a war of words over the weekend, after the union's secretary-general Mick Lynch said strikes would go ahead as ""no viable settlements"" had been found to the disputes.But Transport Secretary Grant Shapps accused union bosses of refusing to meet for further talks and instead attending a protest march against the rising cost of living.Shapps said the disruption would cause ""misery"" and force hospital patients to cancel appointments and pupils sitting exams would face extra pressures of having to change their travel plans.",WORLD,EUROPE,Picture description not found,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'UK': ('LOC', 2), 'Ukraine': ('LOC', 1), 'Tube': ('LOC', 1), 'London': ('LOC', 1), 'RMT': ('ORG', 5), 'Network Rail': ('ORG', 1), 'Transport': ('ORG', 1), 'S': ('ORG', 2), 'Glastonbury': ('MISC', 1), 'COVID - 19': ('MISC', 1), 'Andrew Haines': ('PER', 1), 'Mick Lynch': ('PER', 1), 'Grant': ('PER', 1)}"
383,"Russia has assured Hungary of continued gas shipments, foreign minister says",Reuters,2022-06-20,"Russia has promised to continue gas shipments to Hungary and that Gazprom will fulfil its contractual obligations to the country, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said in an interview on public service radio on Sunday.In Russia's response to West sanctions imposed on Moscow since the start of its militray operation in Ukraine, state energy giant Gazprom has cut supplies to Denmark's Orsted and to Shell Energy for its contract to supply gas to Germany.It also cut supplies to Dutch gas trader GasTerra along with Bulgaria, Poland and Finland for refusing to make payments for Russia gas in rubles under a new ruble scheme.Szijjarto said that Gazprom CEO Alexey Miller and Russia's deputy prime minister Alexander Novak had both assured him in a phone call that the company would fulfil its obligations toward Hungary set out in its contract, Szijjarto said.The minister did not say when the phone call took place. The foreign ministry did not immediately reply to a request for comment.Under a deal with Gazprom signed last year, Hungary receives 3.5 billion cubic meters (bcm) of gas per year via Bulgaria and Serbia under its long-term deal with Russia, and a further 1 bcm via a pipeline from Austria.The agreement is valid for 15 years, with an option to modify purchased quantities after 10 years.Szijjarto also said on Sunday that Hungary's energy security, including its gas supply, is stable and that gas shipments have been arriving daily as per the contract, on schedule, and without any disruptions.Russia gas flows to EU fell short of demand on Friday as Italy and Slovakia reported receiving less than half of the usual volumes through the Nordstream 1 pipeline, which crosses the Baltic Sea from Russia to Germany and accounts for around 40 percent of Russia pipeline flows to the EU (EU).On Sunday Germany announced further steps to boost gas storage levels to prepare for the next winter season, when it fears Russia could reduce or even completely halt supplies.Reuters",WORLD,EUROPE,"Photo taken on May 24, 2022 shows the entry point of the Druzhba pipeline between Hungary and Russia at the Danube Refinery in Szazhalombatta, Hungary.Photo:Xinhua",Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'Russia': ('LOC', 9), 'Hungary': ('LOC', 4), 'Moscow': ('LOC', 1), 'Ukraine': ('LOC', 1), 'Denmark': ('LOC', 1), 'Germany': ('LOC', 3), 'Bulgaria': ('LOC', 2), 'Poland': ('LOC', 1), 'Finland': ('LOC', 1), 'Serbia': ('LOC', 1), 'Austria': ('LOC', 1), 'Italy': ('LOC', 1), 'Slovakia': ('LOC', 1), 'Baltic Sea': ('LOC', 1), 'Gazprom': ('ORG', 4), 'Orsted': ('ORG', 1), 'Shell Energy': ('ORG', 1), 'GasTerra': ('ORG', 1), 'EU': ('ORG', 3), 'Hungarian': ('MISC', 1), 'West': ('MISC', 1), 'Dutch': ('MISC', 1), 'Nordstream 1': ('MISC', 1), 'Peter Szijjarto': ('PER', 4), 'Alexey Miller': ('PER', 1), 'Alexander Novak': ('PER', 1)}"
384,"US reaps windfalls as Europe sinks into deeper economic distress, sees strategic autonomy weakened",By GT staff reporters,2022-06-20,"Editor's note: As the US moves to stir up contradictions between Russia and West countries by calling upon sanctions against Russia and giving hard-to-materialize promises to EU that it would help EU reduce reliance upon Russia energy supplies, it is pushing EU into further economic distress such as higher inflation and energy crises. This is the third article of a multi-part series on the US’ exporting of economic crises to the world.  US' guiding role for the West alliances to pile on sanctions against Russia, intensifying contradictions between Russia and Ukraine, as well as its hard-to-materialize promises to help EU reduce reliance upon Russia energy supplies, are increasingly dragging EU into an energy crisis and economic distress.Now that many EU countries are already on the verge of economic chaos, with inflation skyrocketing, social instability uprising and many people losing their jobs, an even bigger risk is looming over the continent, as EU is drifting away from its strategy of being independent, while its industrial competiveness will fall behind if it relies too much on the US for products and technologies, economists said. ""The EU is an important victim of the Ukraine crisis,"" Wang Yiwei, director of the Institute of International Affairs at the Renmin University of China, told the Global Times on Monday. A difficult position In recent months, the economic problems faced by EU have repeatedly hit the headlines, as EU economies face a surging inflation in commodities ranging from gas, cars to food, a phenomenon that is causing pain among EU residents. According to a report by CNBC on May 31, Germany inflation came in at 8.7 percent in May, significantly outstripping analyst expectations of 8 percent. France inflation also surpassed expectations in May to a notch record 5.8 percent, up from 5.4 percent in April, while Spanish consumer prices jumped by an annual 8.5 percent in May, exceeding expectations of 8.1 percent. One driver behind rising prices is energy price inflation, as energy supplies from Russia dwindle amid the Russia-Ukraine conflicts. In particular, Russia has reduced gas flow to EU over the conflict, while EU leaders were also reportedly planning to block most Russia oil imports by the end of 2022 to punish Russia. The tit-for-tat confrontation is now placing EU on a very dangerous situation of an energy crisis, as normally the EU imports about 40 percent of its total gas consumption from Russia. According to a Reuters report, Germany's network regulator Bundesnetzagentur noted recently that the situation around gas supplies remained ""tense."" It cautioned that even if Germany's gas storage facilities were 100 percent filled it would only last for two and a half months if Russia were to stop supplies completely.Experts stressed that although the tensed relations between EU and Russia are triggered by EU's feeling of insecurity for Russia, it was also aggravated by the US' instigation, as it only ""paid lip services"" to the EU that it would help EU reduce their energy reliance on Russia.The Joe Biden administration has promised to provide an extra 15 billion cubic meters of liquified natural gas (LNG) to the EU this year, which represents about a tenth of the gas the EU now gets from Russia.""The 15 billion cubic meters is a 'tiny' number considering EU's energy imports from Russia, not to mention that the operation is very difficult in the short term, as there's almost no infrastructure to transport natural gas from the US to EU right now,"" Lin Boqiang, director of the China Center for Energy Economics Research at Xiamen University, told the Global Times on Monday. According to Lin, the US first needs to build special vessels to transport the gas, which will take about 2-3 years. Besides, the cost of US-produced natural gas will definitely be much more expensive than Russia energy, which is an extra burden on EU economy. Yang Chengyu, a deputy research fellow at the China Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times on Monday that US' call for Russia-bound sanctions is partly driven by its intention to seek profits for itself, including boosting LNG and oil products exports to EU. Besides, many other commodities' prices are also hiking in EU over the Ukraine crisis, fuelling social disorder. According to a report by the Guardian on June 18, thousands of people have gathered in London to protest against the government's lack of action in tackling the cost of living crisis. Car prices have also reportedly risen in Turkey recently over global supply chain disruptions and high volatility in the country's national currency. Yang noted that EU countries have been quite reliant on grain imports from Russia and Ukraine, which is one of the major reasons behind the recent inflation in EU. Lack of dependenceExperts noted that EU set to rely more on US products, not only slashing the continent's independent strategy, but posing hurts to EU countries' industrial competitiveness.According to Wang, the US and EU are two developed economies which have also been competing, and the affordable Russia energy resources integrating with the Germany manufacturing has helped reindustrialize the EU and even contributed to the interconnection of Eurasia, which will threaten the US. ""The US' fueling up the Russia-Ukraine conflict also accelerates the divisions of EU members and hurts the EU's strategic autonomy as members insisting different attitudes toward sanctions on Russia,"" Wang noted, adding that US' undermining the relationship between Russia and the EU will force EU to partly rely on it for energy resources. The US has been developing and selling its LNG, aiming to export it around the world and dominate the global energy market, Wang said, noting that the US wants to control EU's energy security and lead EU's energy transition, which further expressed its financial hegemony. Consequently, the EU economy may fall into stagflation or a deep recession.Yang stressed that as EU shows increased dependence on the US, previously in safety and defense sectors and now extending to industrial products, energy and technologies, it would make EU economy lose independence in the future. For example, he said that manufacturing industries' global operation capabilities largely hinge on energy costs. ""EU's energy cost in the future is unlikely to have any advantages compared with US products. Thus, the competitiveness of EU's industries in the future will face challenges,"" Yang said.",SOURCE,ECONOMY,"Trucks transport fuel tanks through the streets of the St. Pauli district of Hamburg, Germany, April 19, 2022.

385,Global refugee population hits 100m amid regional conflicts sown by West,Lin Xiaoyi,2022-06-20,"On the 22nd World Refugee Day on Monday, a report released by the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) showed that the number of refugees has surpassed 100 million, bringing renewed attention to the refugee crisis in international public opinion. Experts said as long as the US and its allies keep exporting turmoil and creating crises for their selfish ends, the refugee problem will not be solved.According to UNHCR, 100 million displaced was reached in May, 10 weeks after the Russia-Ukraine conflict prompted a global cereal and fertilizer shortage. Since February, the crisis has internally displaced over 8 million people in Ukraine, with more than 6.5 million of them having crossed international borders into neighboring countries including Poland and Moldova.One hundred million is a stark figure. This must serve as a wake-up call to resolve and prevent destructive conflicts, end persecution, and address the underlying causes that force innocent people to flee their homes, said UN High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi. ""The US-led NATO expanded eastward without any regard for Russia's security concerns, eventually triggering the conflict and causing the displacement of millions of Ukraine refugees, which has not only prompted a new refugee crisis in the EU, but also added to the global refugee problem,"" Zhou Zhanggui, a research fellow in nontraditional security and peaceful development studies from Zhejiang University, told the Global Times .Citing World Bank data, UNHCR said that a total of 850 million people in 23 countries faced ""medium or high-intensity conflicts."" According to the latest statistics, Syria remains the world's largest source of the global refugee population, followed by Venezuela, with Afghanistan in third.From waging wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, to the cultivation of anti-government forces in West Asia and North Africa to promote the ""Arab Spring,"" to its direct involvement in the war in Syria, and long-term intervention in Venezuela's internal affairs, West countries' continued provocation of regional conflicts is the root cause of the refugee crisis, Zhou noted.However, when it comes to accepting refugees, these grandiose West countries only pay lip service to the issue.The UK government, for example, stands accused of trading people like commodities to send asylum seekers on a one-way ticket away to Rwanda on June 14, a plan that has since been stalled when the EU Court intervened, Al Jazeera reported.And after the start of the Ukraine crisis, the US promised to accept 100,000 Ukraine refugees while sending weapons to Ukraine to create more bloodshed. But as of early April, nearly 3,000 Ukrainians were waiting at the US-Mexico border to enter the US. The asylum process is frequently backlogged and can take years, and asylum seekers are entitled to virtually no benefits, according to US News and World Report.""China, on the other hand, has been pragmatic in its humanitarian assistance work,"" Zhou said, noting that China has been promoting regional peace and social stability under multilateral mechanisms, from the stance of trying to solve the conflict at its source. ""However, as long as West countries are still actively creating chaos globally, the refugee problem cannot fundamentally be solved,"" Zhou said.",CHINA,DIPLOMACY,"A Palestinian refugee girl looks out from her house window at Balata refugee camp in the West Bank city of Nablus, March 16, 2022.Photo:Xinhua",Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'World Refugee Day': ('MISC', 1), 'Russia': ('MISC', 2), 'Arab Spring': ('MISC', 1), 'UN': ('ORG', 2), 'UNHCR': ('ORG', 3), 'NATO': ('ORG', 1), 'EU': ('ORG', 2), 'Zhejiang University': ('ORG', 1), 'Global Times': ('ORG', 1), 'World Bank': ('ORG', 1), 'US': ('LOC', 3), 'Ukraine': ('LOC', 4), 'Poland': ('LOC', 1), 'Moldova': ('LOC', 1), 'Syria': ('LOC', 2), 'Venezuela': ('LOC', 2), 'Afghanistan': ('LOC', 2), 'Iraq': ('LOC', 1), 'West Asia': ('LOC', 3), 'North Africa': ('LOC', 1), 'UK': ('LOC', 1), 'Rwanda': ('LOC', 1), 'Filippo Grandi': ('PER', 1), 'Zhou Zhanggui': ('PER', 2)}"
386,Major EU countries strive to comfort Ukraine amid contradicting demands,Lü Xiang,2022-06-20,"The leaders of France, Germany, Italy and Romania arrived in Kiev on Thursday. It is the first time that the leaders of France, Germany and Italy visited Kiev since the start of the Ukraine crisis. The US and West media outlets reported that the trip shows the so-called collective EU support for Ukraine.France, Germany and Italy are considered major EU powers. But their leaders' trip to Kiev is just a political show. Although they have expressed support for Ukraine, this seems to be at odds with reality. France President Emmanuel Macron and Germany Chancellor Olaf Scholz held several telephone conversations with Russia President Vladimir Putin, separately and together, since the outbreak of the crisis. This has triggered some grievances in Kiev.Furthermore, both the US and the EU members vowed to supply weapons to Ukraine. However, Ukraine Deputy Defense Minister Hanna Maliar said on June 14 that Ukraine had received only 10 percent of the promised weapons from the West, which has frustrated Ukraine officials.Against this background, the purpose of visit to Kiev by the three leaders of major EU powers tends to comfort Ukraine's dissatisfaction and mollify Ukraine officials. This fully embodies their hypocrisy.Few substantive moves were seen during the three leaders' trip to Kiev. What has been relatively widely reported is these leaders' support of Ukraine's ""status of immediate candidate"" for EU membership. But Vladimir Putin said on Friday that Russia is not concerned that Ukraine may receive the status of an EU candidate ""because the EU is not a military organization.""  Additionally, there are certain thresholds to gaining EU membership. Even if Ukraine is now offered candidate status, it is still a long way from obtaining full membership. Take Turkey as an example, which has been as a candidate for a membership of the bloc for more than two decades. Ukraine is in a state of war, and its economy lags behind that of EU member states in terms of its scale and development. It can be concluded that the candidate status to Ukraine is just a symbolic and conciliatory gesture.The visit by leaders from France, Germany and Italy is indeed to join forces to engage in a policy of appeasement. Germany, EU's locomotive, relies on Russia for energy. France and Italy are two of the biggest EU buyers of Russia gas. At least in the short and medium term, the three major EU powers cannot get rid themselves of such dependence. As a result, they have to adopt an appeasement policy while they express support to Ukraine.Military factor also leads to the appeasement policy by EU countries such as France, Germany and Italy. Additionally, in EU, none of Russia's neighboring countries want a direct war with Russia, given that Russia is a nuclear power. The entire NATO camp, including the US, cannot engage in a direct military confrontation with Russia. The contradictions between the EU and Ukraine are actually expanding. As a result, apart from a political show, this visit will not have any real effect. Just as Russia Deputy Chair of the UN Dmitry Medvedev tweeted on Thursday, ""EU fans of frogs, liverwurst and spaghetti love visiting Kiev. With zero use… It won't bring Ukraine closer to peace."" The three leaders' visit will not change the course of the Russia-Ukraine conflict.Big EU powers' intent to arrange the fate of a small country is affected by the US to certain extent. In the post-World War II political and military system, there is no genuine independent EU country, including France, Germany and Italy. Their engagement in the Ukraine crisis is passive. It will take a long time for major EU countries to become politically independent genuinely. From the beginning of the Ukraine crisis, the EU has been much less EU. The bloc seems to have become an extension of the US State Department, and every speech by its leaders sounds as if it were drafted by the NATO secretariat.The ongoing Ukraine crisis continues to drag on, and EU does not have the capability or determination to settle any problem in this regard. It is widely known that the root and solution to the crisis lies in the US, instead of Ukraine. But the US' domestic situation is a mess. Where is the way out of the crisis? It is really a conundrum.The author is a research fellow at the China Academy of Social Sciences. opinion@globaltimes.com.cn",OPINION,VIEWPOINT,"(From left) Romanian President Klaus Iohannis, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and French President Emmanuel Macron arrive for a press conference in at Mariinsky Palace in Kiev,on June 16, 2022.",Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'France': ('LOC', 6), 'Germany': ('LOC', 6), 'Italy': ('LOC', 5), 'Romania': ('LOC', 1), 'Kiev': ('LOC', 6), 'Ukraine': ('LOC', 14), 'US': ('LOC', 2), 'West': ('LOC', 2), 'Russia': ('LOC', 4), 'Turkey': ('LOC', 1), 'EU': ('ORG', 12), 'Emmanuel Macron': ('PER', 1), 'Olaf Scholz': ('PER', 1), 'Vladimir Putin': ('PER', 2), 'Hanna Maliar': ('PER', 1)}"
387,"NATO chief predicts protracted Ukraine war, mirrors divided bloc",Global Times,2022-06-20,"In an interview with the Germany newspaper Bild published on Sunday, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg warned that the Ukraine war could last for years and the West must prepare for it. He then urged West countries to ""not cease to support Ukraine"" despite high costs.The fire of war has raged in Ukraine for almost four months. Stoltenberg's prediction sounds more like a plan and a wish of NATO, a military alliance that can profit from the prolonged war in Ukraine.China military expert and TV commentator Song Zhongping told the Global Times that what could last for years, in fact, is the state of confrontation between Moscow and Kiev.""Such a state can stall Russia and will eventually weaken Russia, just as NATO and the US have anticipated,"" Song said.As for how long the war could last, the answer lies in how much more military aid the West can provide Ukraine because the Ukraine military alone has no capability to engage in a dragged-out military conflict.However, it is naive for Stoltenberg to expect all NATO members to help Ukraine against Russia. After all, the NATO secretary general has no right to order 30 sovereign countries to follow his lead to boost support for Ukraine.Song claims that there is no way for NATO to form a joint effort to prepare for a prolonged war with Russia because most NATO members supporting Ukraine have already felt exhausted and frustrated.UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Saturday expressed concerns that a bit of ""Ukraine fatigue"" is starting to set in around the world.Some countries supporting Ukraine since the beginning of the Russia-Ukraine war are feeling increasingly overwhelmed if they continue aiding Ukraine. For many, the war in Ukraine is like a bottomless pit that keeps requesting more input while giving nothing back.A recent survey conducted in 10 EU countries showed that even though the support for Ukraine remained strong, the concerns of people in these countries have shifted to the broader effects of the ongoing conflict. Many are quite worried about the potential higher cost of living resulting from the war. Moreover, a deepening division has come into being between those who want a quick end to the Ukraine war and those who want Russia punished.In a Los Angeles Times opinion piece on Sunday entitled ""War in Ukraine is a battle of wills and economic pain - and the West is showing fatigue,"" the author writes, ""Even in the US, however, inflation has eroded public support for the war."" According to an Associated Press poll in April, the majority of US voters called for tough sanctions against Russia regardless of possible US economic pains. But one month later, most people gave limiting damage to the US economy the top priority.Stoltenberg is pushing the West, mainly EU, to even greater suffering in terms of economy and society. He seems to have forgotten the high costs that he wants the whole West to disregard will have to be paid in the end by many West countries and their people. It is totally irresponsible for him to do so.As NATO faces the Ukraine war, what it claimed to be ""the greatest security crisis in a generation,"" the alliance extended Stoltenberg's term as the secretary-general in March by a year. ""In this extra year, Stoltenberg just wants more political success. But his wishes are very difficult to come true,"" Song commented.",OPINION,OBSERVER,"NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg speaks during a press conference ahead of the alliance's Defence Ministers' meeting at the NATO headquarters in Brussels on March 15, 2022.

388,Central Asia-China cooperation crucial to regional security and development: ambassador,Sun Haoran,2022-06-20,"Central Asia-China cooperation crucial to regional security and development: Kazakh ambassador (exclusive full interview)As key member states in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO), China and Kazakhstan are expected to cooperate in ensuring regional security, fighting against terrorism, separatism, and extremism, and enhancing economic coordination under the ­China-proposed Belt and Road ­Initiative (BRI) amid the current ­uncertainty being seen in the global supply chains, said Kazakh Ambassador in China Shakhrat Nuryshev on Monday.China was one of the first countries to recognize Kazakhstan's independence in January 1992, and Kazakhstan highly appreciates the level of Kazakh-China strategic partnership which is considered a benchmark of interstate relations with great stability to weather any challenges, Nuryshev told the Global Times in an exclusive interview after the start of his second term as Ambassador of Kazakhstan to China. ""Our countries have no unsettled issues, no political discords. This factor creates favorable conditions for the dynamic development of trade and economic relations. Kazakhstan is interested in enhancing bilateral cooperation, building mutual trust, friendship, and good neighborliness with China,"" said Nuryshev.The envoy said that despite the ongoing global pandemic, the degree of dialogue between the two countries has nearly returned to pre-pandemic levels in 2022. ""From this perspective, the 'diplomacy of the heads of state' and the close personal relations of the leaders of our countries play a special role."" A lot of agreements, the practical implementation of which is contingent on the foreign services of the two countries, have been reached. In that regard, the recent visit of the China State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi is very symbolic to have been made during this period of time, he said. From June 6 to 8, Wang visited Kazakhstan upon invitation and attended the third China+Central Asia (C+C5) Foreign Ministers' Meeting, which was the first time that the C+C5 foreign ministers' meeting was held in a Central Asia country, according to the China Foreign Ministry's website.""The visit once again demonstrated the high level of bilateral relations and the steadfastness of the principles built on good neighborliness, friendship, and mutual benefit. Views have been thoroughly exchanged on the entire wide-ranging cooperation,"" Nuryshev said. ""The parties have made progress in addressing issues of ensuring regional security, increasing trade, developing economic investment, transportation, and humanitarian cooperation."" A China-EU freight train leaves Luoyang, Central China's Henan Province for Kazakhstan on April 6, 2022. Photo: VCG""I would like to emphasize that in just two years the Central Asia-China dialogue has proven to be one of the most effective and promising platforms for comprehensive cooperation, capable of strengthening the atmosphere of trust, neighborliness, and the constructive search for mutually acceptable approaches to addressing urgent regional and international challenges,"" he said. In practical terms, agreements under the scope of the format have been reached to coordinate COVID-19 prevention efforts, jointly ensure regional security, protect digital data, and upgrade regional transport connectivity, he said, adding that ""I see a huge potential for Central Asia-China cooperation, I believe it is important to actively use it in order to accelerate the development of intra-regional trade and economic processes, which will allow the region to become one of the core and dynamic growth centers.""Sanctions not helpingAs for the Russia-Ukraine crisis, the ambassador said that Kazakhstan, historically, has always been closely linked to Russia politically, economically, culturally, and through people-to-people exchanges, and Russia is Kazakhstan's ally legally and politically. And Kazakhstan is also interested in the early recovery of the high dynamics of broad mutually beneficial cooperation with Ukraine. ""Therefore, we sincerely believe that Moscow and Kiev will find a way to adjust their differences peacefully in the near future,"" said Nuryshev.""We always take the attitude of the need to keep the dialogue going even in the most difficult situations. The use of any economic or political sanctions historically is not the most effective way to settle international disputes and conflicts.""Kazakhstan gives every assistance in peacekeeping efforts to find ways to end the armed stand-off, address humanitarian problems and ease tension in international relations,"" he said.  Therefore, Kazakhstan does not intend to join the sanctions pressure on any country and take actions that would be contrary to the sense of the dialogue, said the ambassador.The envoy emphasized that ""in this regard, I believe that in order to protect our own national interests, it is necessary to make every effort to prevent these sanctions from having a serious impact on the development of our economies and the well-being of their peoples.""Cooperation in regional securityToday, in the current context of international relations, the role of Central Asia is increasingly strengthening. The security of a number of neighboring countries depends on the stability and development of Central Asia, which holds a strategically important position on the Eurasian continent, said the envoy.""Therefore, Central Asia claims greater attention from the world powers, especially in the wake of settling the problems of regional security and socio-economic development,"" he said, pointing out that ""China, neighboring the countries of Central Asia, as a regular member of the UN and one of the active participants in such regional mechanisms as the SCO, Conference on Interaction and Confidence Building Measures in Asia (CICA), and the 'Central Asia - China (CA-PRC)' format, plays an important role in supporting stability and security in the region.""Nuryshev said that in practical terms, within all these mechanisms, there is close cooperation, especially in the fight against the so-called ""forces of three evils"" - terrorism, separatism, and extremism. ""For example, in the SCO Regional Anti-Terrorist Structure, the competent authorities of the member states have been successfully counteracting the spread of destructive forces in the Organization's area of responsibility for a long period of time,"" he said.""In turn, the SCO's three-level mechanism for fighting against drug-related crime is effectively working to block channels of financing terrorism and drug trafficking. Even the military component of the SCO has a strong antiterrorist focus.""He said the CICA has the necessary potential and matured experience to develop common confidence-building measures to fight against current challenges and threats in Asia, adding that ""we are grateful to the China side for its strong support of the CICA's activities and significant contribution to the promotion of the Kazakh initiative to transform the Conference into full-fledged international organization.""BRI opens new doorsIn terms of economic coordination, the ambassador said the trade turnover between China and Kazakhstan has increased 70-fold over a 30-year period, which amounts to more than $25 billion, according to China's customs statistics.""And this is not the limit. There are huge ­opportunities for increased bilateral trade. Now, for these purposes, our countries are actively cooperating in search of new opportunities to develop cooperation amidst the coronavirus disease pandemic and global challenges,"" he said.In a recent address to his fellow countrymen, Kazakh President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev put forward a large-scale program of political modernization for the country with the main goal of a comprehensive overhaul of the entire state model of development, Nuryshev said.He noted that political reform in Kazakhstan is being carried out on the sidelines of comprehensive economic reforms aimed at building a genuine market and a free and competitive economy.""Amid quite a stressful international situation, the disruption to global supply chains, trade wars, and unprecedented inflationary pressure have all become a fact of life presently. In such a climate, states and businesses need to quickly adapt to the new rules of the game so as to maintain their competitiveness,"" said the envoy.Nuryshev said the BRI is well-timed in that regard. The initiative has opened new doors for various states. The implementation of joint projects has enabled the resolution of such issues as the construction of new infrastructure and industrial enterprises through the involvement of advanced technologies and the creation of new jobs.In 2014, the two countries launched a joint program and created a mechanism for coordinated efforts in industrial and investment cooperation. Thanks to this, China has been among the five largest investors in Kazakhstan in recent years in terms of increased direct foreign investment, said the ambassador.Moreover, it has to be said that the coronavirus disease pandemic, in general, has become a catalyst for the development of digital and IT technologies, ""smart"" solutions, more broader so-called ""new infrastructure,"" covering both material and virtual supplies, he said.""We should take into account the successes and achievements of China in technological development and boost cooperation in this field,"" he added.",IN-DEPTH,DIPLOMATIC CHANNEL,Kazakh Ambassador in China Shakhrat Nuryshev Photo: Courtesy of the Embassy of Kazakhstan in Beijing,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'Central Asia': ('LOC', 3), 'China': ('LOC', 11), 'Kazakhstan': ('LOC', 6), 'Kazakh': ('MISC', 3), 'Belt and Road Initiative': ('MISC', 1), 'BRI': ('MISC', 1), 'Shanghai Cooperation Organization': ('ORG', 1), 'SCO': ('ORG', 1), 'Global Times': ('ORG', 1), 'Council': ('ORG', 1), 'Shakhrat Nuryshev': ('PER', 3), 'Wang Yi': ('PER', 2)}"

390,BRICS Summit: expectations and groundbreaking trajectories,Swaran Singh,2022-06-19,"The coming BRICS Summit - to be hosted online by China on June 23 - is already drawing attention for becoming the first multilateral forum of this year where Russia President Vladimir Putin will be seen interacting directly with national leaders from China, India, Brazil, South Africa and several other invited nations.The summit likely would be read in the West as the BRICS countries' enhanced support and endorsement of Vladimir Putin's policies. This is because they have been extremely uncomfortable with all BRICS members resisting the US-led campaign to denounce Russia actions and slap unbearable sanctions against Russia.The reality is that China stands out as the largest importer of Russia energy and India as the largest importer of Russia defense equipment. What adds to US discomfiture is that most of its own allies have also been and continued to be major importers of Russia energy. But while the Ukraine crisis has seen US allies reduce their Russia imports, China and India have increased theirs. This has been facilitated by the BRICS' shared policy stance on Ukraine: refusing to denounce Russia, urging both sides for immediate cessation of hos-tilities and for initiating direct talk to resolve this crisis.Second, the most novel proposition of this summit - BRICS expansion - also makes the presence of Vladimir Putin and several new invitees open to various interpretations. The Ukraine crisis has seen fissures emerge in the G20 and adding new members to BRICS could make it an alternative minus US and its allies. This could also mean an expanded BRICS overtaking G7 earlier than imagined. BRICS has been shy of adding new members and South Africa was the last to be added in 2010. But a change in mood is in the making. Last year, BRICS added Bangladesh, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Uruguay to its New Development Bank. Last month, BRICS foreign ministers were joined by representatives from Argentina, Egypt, Indonesia, Kazakhstan, Nigeria, the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Senegal and Thailand. National leaders of some of these countries are expected to join the summit and several others will join the BRICS usual leaders' outreach summit.Third, BRICS has always stood as a unique forum that holds dozens of pentagonal meetings that precede their annual summits. These include meetings of their think-tanks, academics, experts, corporates, journalists, followed by advisors, several officials and senior ministers including their foreign ministers. This building of an annual momentum and the resultant institutionalization with relatively lesser media glare have helped BRICS create favorable grassroots constituencies for building trust.Fourth, though they also deliberated on issues of geopolitics and security, BRICS nations are known for their technocratic focus. This has resulted in piecemeal building of credibility reflected in their debates on creating an independent Credit Rating Agency as also in their initiatives like the Currency Reserves Arrangement and now nine-member New Develop-ment Bank which has already disbursed more than $15 billion and completed and/or sanctioned support for hundreds of projects. The bank now has regional offices in South Africa and India and its style of functioning has pushed Bretton Woods institutions into structural reforms.Of course BRICS camaraderie has had its own share of challenges. Externally, BRICS has come to be compared with the US-led Quadrilateral Security Framework that includes Australia, Japan and India. Quad has had four summits in 14 months and precipitously expanded its agenda. At least US presents Quad as aimed at containing China though others vary in their engagement with Beijing. Internally, BRICS' members like Brazil or India are sometimes suspect for being closely aligned to the US. India is a member of both BRICS and the Quad. Comparisons get drawn on how India had walked out of China-led Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership but joined US President Joe Biden's Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity last month. India is not just the second-largest and the fastest growing economy in BRICS but has had issues with Beijing. Also members like India, Brazil, South Africa may not be just sensitive to some of the proposed names for new additions and changes but perhaps susceptible to West criticism of BRICS' evolving dynamics.Moreover, most leaders attending the BRICS summit find themselves focused on their domestic challenges flowing from ongoing pandemic and Ukraine crisis and their eco-nomic and political fallouts like rising prices especially wheat and crude oil. The pandemic has seen China and India engaged in supplying healthcare to the Global South and more recently providing humanitarian assistance to countries from Ukraine to Sri Lanka. In view of these being unusual times, modest expectations like the BRICS Summit consol-idating its extant initiatives and launching negotiations to build consensus on criteria for adding new members and other future initiatives should suffice.The author is a Visiting Professor, University of UK Columbia and Fellow, Canada Global Affairs Institute (Canada) and Professor of Jawaharlal Nehru University, India. opinion@globaltimes.com.cn",OPINION,VIEWPOINT,BRICS Photo: VCG,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'BRICS Summit': ('MISC', 1), 'Saudi': ('MISC', 1), 'China': ('LOC', 4), 'Russia': ('LOC', 8), 'India': ('LOC', 3), 'Brazil': ('LOC', 1), 'South Africa': ('LOC', 2), 'West': ('LOC', 1), 'US': ('LOC', 4), 'Ukraine': ('LOC', 3), 'Bangladesh': ('LOC', 1), 'Egypt': ('LOC', 2), 'United Arab Emirates': ('LOC', 1), 'UAE': ('LOC', 2), 'Uruguay': ('LOC', 1), 'New': ('LOC', 1), 'Argentina': ('LOC', 1), 'Indonesia': ('LOC', 1), 'Kazakhstan': ('LOC', 1), 'Nigeria': ('LOC', 1), 'Arabia': ('LOC', 1), 'Senegal': ('LOC', 1), 'Thailand': ('LOC', 1), 'Vladimir Putin': ('PER', 3), 'BRICS': ('ORG', 11), 'G20': ('ORG', 1), 'G7': ('ORG', 1)}"
391,China's vision offers an opportunity to reflect on a sustainable intl security structure: former Danish diplomat,Global Times,2022-06-19," Editor's Note: During the past decade, the world has increasingly witnessed the trend of ""the East is rising, and the West is declining"" in the spheres of economy, security and discourse power. The West countries, particularly the US, plagued by internal woes, have sought the old path of passing the buck and instigating turmoil elsewhere to ease their own pressure. China, representative of the emerging countries, is proposing the new solutions to global problems. By advocating win-win development, facilitating consultation and reconciliation, proposing a balanced and effective security mechanism, China is striving for building a community with a shared future for mankind. In the second of this series, Carsten Boyer Thøgersen, a former diplomat with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Denmark and the EU Commission, told Global Times reporter Lu Yuanzhi that the China-proposed Global Security Initiative is a different approach to international cooperation than that proposed by the US and gives all nations an opportunity to reflect on a sustainable international security structure. Global Times: NATO has continued its military aid to Ukraine as the Russia-Ukraine conflict has lasted more than 100 days. NATO pursues absolute security, but it brings insecurity to Russia. Do you think this NATO-dominated security mechanism can exist in EU for a long time?  Thøgersen: NATO was established in 1949 at the beginning of the Cold War which was a confrontation between West allied countries headed by the US and EU countries headed by the Soviet Union. The Cold War was a worldwide conflict involving several continents. When the Soviet Union was dissolved in 1991, the primary objective of NATO ceased to exist.  Russia are Europeans and Russia West of the Ural Mountain Range is part of EU. After 1991, cooperation on security issues in EU is a regional EU question and should be handled by Europeans themselves. Such cooperation should be based upon diplomacy and negotiations. Global Times: Some analysts believe that EU bears huge losses caused by the Russia-Ukraine conflict. The continent is encountering a series of consequences such as rising energy prices and a sluggish economic recovery. What's your take? Thøgersen: EU including Russia and Ukraine will undoubtedly suffer long-term economic losses because of the Russia-Ukraine conflict. For Europeans this is a sad prospect for the future economic development in EU. 

Carsten Boyer Th?gersen Global Times: The US seems to have an incentive to prolong the Russia-Ukraine crisis. Are you worried about war spillover? Will more EU countries be involved? Thøgersen: The present armed conflict between Russia and Ukraine could have been prevented. Ukraine's position in the EU security structure - neutral, West-oriented or Russia-oriented - has been a central question for more than 20 years. The Russia invasion of Ukraine doesn't solve this problem and a prolongment of the armed conflict even less. Apparently, the US endgame is the total defeat of Russia. Elimination of a nation like Russia will not happen. Existing security problems must be addressed through negotiations. Global Times: From a non-EU perspective, NATO's eastward expansion to Russia's doorstep is the root cause of the Ukraine crisis. As a EU, what's your take on the bloc's five rounds of eastward expansion? Thøgersen: One country invading another sovereign country is not acceptable. This is breaking a fundamental principle in international politics, whatever the cause may be. That said, there is a history behind the Russia invasion, and it is obvious that Russia saw its security concerns challenged. However, whatever concerns, solutions to questions on security shall be pursued through diplomacy and negotiations, not by military means.  Global Times: Some analysts believe NATO may expand into Asia. AUKUS and Quad are all part of this. What's your take? Thøgersen: Article 6 of the North Atlantic Treaty defines the geographic scope of NATO as covering ""an armed attack on the territory of any of the Parties in EU or North US."" Until a few years ago, East Asia and China was not on the agenda of NATO. At the end of June 2022, a NATO summit will take place in Madrid and China will be on the agenda. We shall wait and see the official statement after the meeting. Global Times: China President Xi Jinping in April proposed a Global Security Initiative which stressed a commitment to the vision of common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security. The unilateral security architecture has brought a great deal of conflict and instability to the world. The new era calls for a new security concept. What do you think of this proposal? Thøgersen: In April 2022 at the Boao Forum for Asia in Hainan, China's President Xi Jinping launched the Global Security Initiative. The initiative includes all countries, is committed to respecting the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all countries, uphold non-interference in internal affairs and committed to abiding by the purposes and principles of the UN Charter. The Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and the Bandung Spirit from the 1950s are also mentioned. The initiative is a different approach to international cooperation than that proposed by the US and gives all nations an opportunity to reflect on a sustainable international security structure. For that reason, the Global Security Initiative should be welcomed. Global Times: Many developing countries, such as India, have expressed different positions from the US and EU in terms of the Ukraine crisis. What's your view? Does it represent a kind of new trend? Thøgersen: Most of the developing countries see the Russia-Ukraine conflict as a regional EU confrontation and many developing countries have different views on the conflict than the US and the EU. For now, it is difficult to see this as a new trend. Global Times: Some EU leaders underline EU's strategic autonomy. How do you see the prospect of EU strategic autonomy? Against the backdrop of EU's pursuit of strategic autonomy, what's your opinion about the future of China-EU cooperation? Thøgersen: In 2003, Germany and France did not support the US invasion of Iraq. That was a manifestation of Germany and France strategic autonomy.  Today, the geopolitical landscape and security structure of EU is still influenced by the outcome of the World War II. The US has 65,000 troops based in EU, half of which are in Germany. In 2020, the United Kingdom closed its last military base in Germany and withdrew its remaining troops. In terms of military capacity, economy, financial structures, and political influence, the US is the number one superpower in the world. Except for a handful, all 27 EU member states are also members of the NATO. EU strategic autonomy will have to be negotiated with the US. For the EU when it comes to cooperation with China, the EU will have to consider its relationship to the US.",OPINION,VIEWPOINT,Photo: VCG,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'East': ('LOC', 1), 'US': ('LOC', 4), 'China': ('LOC', 3), 'Denmark': ('LOC', 1), 'Ukraine': ('LOC', 6), 'Russia': ('LOC', 7), 'Soviet Union': ('LOC', 2), 'Russia West': ('LOC', 8), 'Ural Mountain Range': ('LOC', 1), 'West': ('MISC', 3), 'Global Security Initiative': ('MISC', 1), 'Cold War': ('MISC', 2), 'Europeans': ('MISC', 3), 'Carsten Boyer Thøgersen': ('PER', 2), 'Lu Yuanzhi': ('PER', 1), 'Ministry of Foreign Affairs of': ('ORG', 1), 'EU Commission': ('ORG', 9), 'Global Times': ('ORG', 2), 'NATO': ('ORG', 5), 'EUgers': ('ORG', 1)}"

Only her male compatriots Michael Phelps (26 titles) and Ryan Lochte (18) have won more gold medals.Ledecky took full advantage of the absence of reigning world and Olympic champion Ariarne Titmus of Australia to reclaim her title with a time of three minutes and 58.15 seconds, finishing ahead of Canada 15-year-old Summer McIntosh, who took silver.US Leah Smith was third, nearly four seconds behind her compatriot.""It feels good. It's the fastest I've ever been at worlds so I'm really ­happy with that and really excited about the rest of the week I have ahead of me,"" Ledecky told Olympics.com.""Summer is now in the sub-four-minute club so it's only going to get harder.

394,"US’ sizable rate-hiking may lead to recession, hindering Latin America",GT staff reporters,2022-06-19,"Editor's Note: The US resorts to sizeable interest rate hikes to tame scorching inflation, which is hijacking developing countries including its allies under this manmade economic hardship amid COVID-19 pandemic and Russia-Ukraine conflict. Latin US that has witnessed a ""lost decade"" due to the spillover from US' monetary policy tightening may see another economic crisis approaching. This is the second article of a multi-part series on the US' exporting of economic crises to the world.As the driver of global monetary policy, the US selfishly has made the most aggressive move in 28 years by hiking interest rates by 75 basis points to tame domestic inflation amid concerns over an oncoming recession, which carries serious downside risks by aggregating the debt distress and currency depreciation pressure of developing countries, especially in Latin US where asset bubbles have been blown out by the US' ultra-loose monetary policy since the beginning of the pandemic.The US Federal Reserve's rate-hiking cycle will create a lingering impact on Latin US in multiple senses, including raising dollar-denominated debt default risks, a plunge in local currencies and falling exports as demand softens, experts warned.In 2020, the US Fed revamped its monetary policy by raising inflation expectations and lowing real interest rates to boost the economic recovery in the wake of COVID-19 outbreak, with the interest rates reduced to near zero.However, as its ultra-loose monetary policy backfires with US consumers feeling burned by high prices everywhere from supermarkets to gas stations, the Fed made an abrupt U-turn by aggressively hiking interest rates from March 2022 onwards, neglecting the global pain it may cause, especially to developing countries that are undergoing economic hardship amid the ongoing US' tariff war and the Russia-Ukraine conflict.On Wednesday, the US interest rates were hiked by 75 basis points in the biggest move in 1994. Media reports said that the Fed plans to shrink its balance sheet by about $95 billion per month.The Fed's steep interest rate hikes spark the retreat of much more capital from Latin US, resulting in depreciation of local currencies and worsening their debt problems, Zhou Zhiwei, an expert on Latin US studies at the China Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times on Sunday.Due to increased public expenditure to deal with the costs of the pandemic and maintain the standard of living, Latin US's public debt accounts for around 55 percent of the region's GDP, with some economies' debt ratio reaching as high as 70 percent, Zhou said.The impact is ""enormous"" especially for Argentina, the largest debtor to the IMF, said Argentine economist Jorge Marchini, the Xinhua News Agency reported. ""A rising interest rate obviously means a bigger [debt] burden,"" as Argentina's internal and external commitments are managed through variable rates set by the Fed rate, he said.The US' steep interest rate hikes also accelerated investment outflow from Latin US countries - where the investment rate is as low as around 20 percent - adding pressure to the region's sluggish economic recovery that is already weighed in on by a contraction in spending and rise in the poverty rate, Zhou said.""Among Latin US countries, Mexico will be directly impacted by a potential US economic recession as most of the country's industries heavily rely on the US, for example, petroleum, car components and agricultural products,"" Jiang Shixue, director of the Center for Latin US Studies at Shanghai University, told the Global Times.For Latin US, the spillovers from US' monetary policy tightening have contributed to some of the worst economic crises in the region over the past several decades. In addition to the ""lost decade,"" a period when the region witnessed contracted per capita income growth for the 1980s, the Fed's rate-hiking cycle in 1994 sparked another crisis in Mexico.Struggles for economic revivalAmid a variety of challenges including slower growth in the US, tighter monetary and financing conditions and emergence of the Omicron variant, the IMF downgraded the region's economic growth forecast for 2022 from 3 percent to 2.4 percent in a January report.It said that the region must ensure the sustainability of public finances, raise potential growth and do it in a manner that promotes social cohesion and addresses inequities.To fight the negative impact of a stronger dollar, Argentina's central bank on Thursday raised its benchmark interest rate by 300 basis points to 52 percent, the sharpest rise since 2019, as the country's inflation hit a new 30-year high of 61 percent year-on-year in May.According to the central bank of Argentina, the rate hike serves mainly to encourage savings in the hard-hit local pesos. ""Their anti-inflationary action then largely involves contributing to exchange and financial stability, and must be complemented with other economic policy instruments to reduce inflationary inertia,"" it added.Brazil, which is Latin US's largest economy, also raised its benchmark interest rate by 50 basis points to 13.25 percent on Wednesday, up sharply from a record low of 2 percent in March 2021.""Many Latin-US countries have endorsed the Belt and Road Initiative and applied to join the Asia Infrastructure Investment Bank. Countries including Chile, Peru and Costa Rica have inked free trade agreements with China and others such as Uruguay and Ecuador are in process of negotiating deals,"" Victor Cadena, executive vice president of the Mexican Chamber of Commerce in China, told the Global Times in a recent interview.China is also among the main sources of foreign direct investment in several Latin US countries, Cadena noted.",SOURCE,ECONOMY,"Palacio de Bellas Artes in Mexico City, Mexico, 2019 Photo: VCG",Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'US': ('LOC', 8), 'Russia': ('LOC', 2), 'Ukraine': ('LOC', 2), 'Latin US': ('LOC', 13), 'China': ('LOC', 1), 'COVID - 19': ('MISC', 2), 'US Federal Reserve': ('ORG', 1), 'US Fed': ('ORG', 4), 'Academy': ('ORG', 1), 'Zhou': ('PER', 1)}"
395,GT Voice: Does G7 still have strength to call the shots on the global economy?,Global Times,2022-06-19,"For years, the West has been seeking out ways to respond to the growing influence of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), and the subject is expected to be raised again at the upcoming Group of Seven (G7) summit, which is scheduled to be held from June 26 to 28 in Germany.US President Joe Biden will launch a global infrastructure initiative to provide an alternative to what the China are offering, which is set to be announced at the G7 summit, US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said, according to a Bloomberg report on Friday.If the G7 countries are truly interested in infrastructure construction and promoting the economic development in the Asia-Pacific region, they are of course welcome to propose a new initiative to facilitate a regional infrastructure agenda. But the key questions remain: Does G7 really have the will to do so? How capable are they of delivering on promises?So far, none of the ideas and programs the G7 countries proposed, jointly or respectively, as an alternative to the BRI has made much progress. At last year's G7 summit, G7 leaders came up with the Build Back Better World (B3W) initiative, another US-led partnership among G7 countries that sought to boost investment in the infrastructure needs of developing countries. Obviously the B3W failed, or there wouldn't be a need to announce a similar framework at this year's G7 summit.In fact, the main reason why the US has again and again teamed up with other West countries to launch high-profile infrastructure initiatives to compete with the BRI is to expand its own influence and thus open markets to US companies. They don't really care whether these plans are implemented or not.If the G7 cared about the real needs of developing countries, they should already have had similar program in place to help developing economies a long time ago. Now it is only because they fear the BRI will gain too much influence, they rushed in to offer plans to compete with the BRI. But the irony is that these West infrastructure plans generally ended up only paying lip service, revealing their hypocrisy toward the developing world.With the G7's share of the global economy declining from over 60 percent in the 1980s to about 40 percent at present, the group's ability to control and influence the global economic and trading system is waning. Indeed, even if the G7 countries did have the will to support infrastructure development in developing countries, their own economies would not allow it. In the UK, the economy just reported a second consecutive monthly contraction for April, with its inflation running high at 9 percent. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development predicted that the UK economy would be the worst performer among major economies next year, recording zero growth.In the US, after the Fed announced its largest interest rate increase in more than a quarter of a century to curb inflation, economists see growing chance of a US recession next year, with inflation remaining high. In the context of the pandemic, the Russia-Ukraine conflict, among others sources of volatility, the global economy is facing difficulties. Under such circumstances, any geopolitical games that would only be counterproductive for the global economy should be avoided.It would probably be the biggest contribution the G7 can make to the current world economy if they focused on getting their economies right instead of engaging in geopolitical confrontation and disrupting global economic activities.",SOURCE,GT VOICE,Photo: IC,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'West': ('LOC', 3), 'Germany': ('LOC', 1), 'US': ('LOC', 5), 'China': ('LOC', 1), 'Asia': ('LOC', 1), 'Pacific': ('LOC', 1), 'Belt': ('MISC', 1), 'Road Initiative': ('MISC', 1), 'Group of Seven': ('MISC', 1), 'Build Back Better World': ('MISC', 1), 'B3W': ('MISC', 1), 'B3': ('MISC', 1), 'and': ('ORG', 1), 'BRI': ('ORG', 5), 'G7': ('ORG', 10), 'Bloomberg': ('ORG', 1), 'G': ('ORG', 2), 'Joe Biden': ('PER', 1), 'Jake Sullivan': ('PER', 1)}"
396,"UK eager to deport asylum seekers, a sign of West breaking rules set by itself",Global Times,2022-06-19,"When a UN human rights expert on Friday urged the UK to halt a policy of transferring some asylum seekers to Rwanda, she said the policy ""violates international law, and risks causing irreparable harm to those seeking international protection."" The inaugural flight of the controversial UK government scheme to send asylum seekers to Rwanda was stopped at the last minute on Tuesday, after an intervention by the EU Court of Human Rights (ECHR).Apparently, the UK insisted on the need to deport these asylum seekers despite a flood of international condemnation. The UK has been under great pressure from what it claims is a mass influx of refugees in recent years, especially after Brexit, which creates problems and conflicts in terms of the policy coordination between the UK and the EU. As a result, the ECHR has to intervene. In view of the burden caused by the refugees to the UK, and the humanitarian pressure of attempting to prevent them from entering the country, the UK will inevitably adopt an approach of ""off-shoring to a third country,"" Wang Shuo, a professor at the School of International Relations of Beijing Foreign Studies University, told the Global Times. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson is very inconsistent in policymaking, erratic in what he says and does, and compliant to few principles. The UK government under his leadership is quite utilitarian when making decisions. With more and more internal conflicts in the Anglosphere, economic and social issues are gradually coming to the fore, with which come great changes, as populism, fragmentation and extremism are exhibited in politics. One of the major reasons Boris Johnson's supporters voted for him and the Boris Johnson-promoted Brexit is their reluctance to subject the UK to EU-related constraints on refugees, resulting in Boris Johnson's choice of demonstrating the UK's ""autonomy"" in this regard to appeal to a portion of conservative voters who are xenophobic. But to save face, Boris Johnson cannot directly reject the refugees, but has to come up with a ""workaround,"" in fact, using the so-called Rwanda asylum plan to provide a way out of directly violating the human rights. Wang believes the UK intends to take this opportunity to break through some of the shackles imposed by EU, such as the provisions of the EU Convention on Human Rights. Therefore, in the long run, the binding force of both international and regional organizations can hardly stop the UK from getting rid of the refugees, despite the potential conflicts regarding this between the UK and EU institutions and even possible sanctions imposed on the UK. Prior to the UK, Australia instituted the hard-line Operation Sovereign Borders program in 2013, which populist former Australia prime minister Scott Morrison claimed were ""the most successful border protection policies anywhere in the world."" Rich countries are scrambling to repatriate refugees from their own countries, which is breaking the rules set by the West itself. When the West wants to promote the international order and its so-called values under the banner of ""human rights,"" it also brings trouble to itself. If the tone of ""political correctness"" is too high while failing to do it in practice, what they do will certainly trigger international outrage, Wang said. In essence, the West's pressure to accept refugees stems from its interventions around the world that created these stateless people. The West is clear that it is to blame for disrupting peace and development of many countries and regions. But for geopolitical interests, countries like the UK still have to whitewash their evil deeds. If the refugees do arrive in a third country, the UK will have dumped its issues on Rwanda, and it will not be held responsible for whether these refugees can continue to live in Rwanda or get good asylum conditions. The West cannot hide its hypocrisy as the UK, Australia, and the US are all the same when it comes to tempting others with wonderful promises that are not attainable.",OPINION,OBSERVER,"Ukrainian refugees are seen at a train station in Lviv, Ukraine on April 8, 2022.

397,"China, Japan set for another round of high-level talk on maritime affairs; results likely to be 'very limited'",Global Times,2022-06-19," China and Japan are expected to hold another round of high-level consultations on maritime affairs on Thursday, Japan media reported on Saturday. However, China experts believe that the results of the talks will be ""very limited,"" given Japan's evasion of the historical facts of the Diaoyu Islands and its recent provocations to China. It will be difficult for the two sides to reach a constructive consensus, but the smooth operation of the dialogue mechanism is positive for the region, experts told the Global Times.At the meeting, China will be represented by Hong Liang, director-general of the Department of Boundary and Ocean Affairs of the Foreign Ministry, while Japan is sending the head of the Asia and Oceanian Affairs Bureau of Japan Foreign Ministry Takehiro Funakoshi, according to Kyodo News.The Diaoyu Islands issue is the biggest dispute between China and Japan in the China Sea region and is expected to be the core topic of the upcoming talks, Liu Jiangyong, vice dean of the Institute of Modern International Relations at Tsinghua University, told the Global Times on Sunday.The Diaoyu Islands have been an inherent territory of China since ancient times. However, ""due to the propaganda of successive Japan administrations on this issue, the Japan people believe that the Diaoyu Islands are Japan's territory,"" Liu said. ""So many Japan people think that China official ships operating near the Diaoyu Islands are intruding into Japan's territorial waters. This misperception should not continue to exist.""In November, 2021 the two sides confirmed in a director-general level meeting that they would adhere to the four-point principled consensus between China and Japan, strengthen dialogue and consultation on maritime affairs and constructively manage differences. However, more than six months after this meeting, the atmosphere of cooperation between the two sides for the joint development of the Diaoyu Islands, which had been previously agreed upon, has been completely destroyed by Japan, experts noted.For China and Japan, the issue of the Diaoyu Islands is a historical one that is difficult to solve overnight. Observers noted, however, the establishment of a rational, professional and stable dialogue mechanism between the relevant China and Japan functionaries is positive for the region.Some observers believe that Tokyo has adopted the most vicious China-policy since ties were normalized 50 years ago, as Japan keeps flirting with China's hot-button issues such as the Taiwan question, and is reportedly aiming to send an active-duty defense official to Taiwan island to strengthen information-gathering capabilities. Japan has also repeatedly pressured China in international settings over the Ukraine crisis.And the US, after regrouping its strategy of global checks and balances, has also used Japan as one of the most important pawns to contain China in Northeast Asia, Li Kaisheng, research fellow and deputy director at the Institute of International Relations of the Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times on Sunday.""Considering the situation, it will be difficult for China-Japan relations to return to a more friendly state in the near future,"" Li said. ""In recent years, China-Japan relations used to rely on a principled consensus to maintain basic stability. With new moves by the US under its 'Indo-Pacific Strategy,' however, the relationship is becoming increasingly unstable.""This increases the difficulty of resolving the Diaoyu Islands issue and the risk of conflict, experts warned. Japan should also stop provocations to avoid further angering China.In a phone call with Japan national security chief Takeo Akiba on June 7, Yang Jiechi, a member of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee and director of the Office of the Foreign Affairs Commission of the CPC Central Committee, said that old problems in China-Japan relations are intertwined with new ones, and the challenges cannot be ignored if the two countries wish to have ""healthy"" relations. Yang also said both countries should work together to ensure ""stable, healthy and resilient"" relations in the next 50 years, and ""jointly maintain regional peace and prosperity.""Global Times",CHINA,POLITICS,Diaoyu Islands in the E China Sea Photo: Xinhua,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'Japan': ('LOC', 16), 'Diaoyu Islands': ('LOC', 6), 'China Sea': ('LOC', 13), 'Diao': ('LOC', 1), 'Diyu Islands': ('LOC', 2), 'Tokyo': ('LOC', 1), 'Taiwan': ('LOC', 1), 'Global Times': ('ORG', 2), 'Department of Boundary and Ocean Affairs': ('ORG', 1), 'Foreign Ministry': ('ORG', 2), 'Asia and Oceanian Affairs Bureau': ('ORG', 1), 'Kyodo News': ('ORG', 1), 'Institute of Modern International Relations': ('ORG', 1), 'Tsinghua University': ('ORG', 1), 'Hong Liang': ('PER', 1), 'Takehiro Funakoshi': ('PER', 1), 'Liu Jiangyong': ('PER', 2)}"
398,Xi to host BRICS Summit; China devt approach anticipated,Zhang Hui,2022-06-17,"When the main theme of peace and development has been seriously challenged by the US-led alliances and when the negative impact of the Russia-Ukraine conflict on the world economy and global sustainable development has become increasingly prominent, China is hosting the BRICS Summit next week to provide a platform for developing nations to build consensus on addressing acute development challenges, analysts said.They said the BRICS Summit also provides a platform for the world to hear a wider range of nations calling for a fair, just and inclusive world governance system, not just the voice of small cliques of the US which mistakenly believe they represent the majority in seeking bloc confrontation and reversing globalization. China President Xi Jinping will host the virtual 14th BRICS Summit in Beijing on June 23, China Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Hua Chunying announced Friday. The Summit will be held under the theme of ""Foster High-quality BRICS Partnership, Usher in a New Era for Global Development."" The Summit will be held under the theme of ""Foster High-quality BRICS Partnership, Usher in a New Era for Global Development."" Xi Jinping will host the High-level Dialogue on Global Development in Beijing on June 24, and BRICS leaders and leaders of relevant emerging markets and developing countries will attend the event. Xi Jinping will attend the opening ceremony of the BRICS Business Forum in virtual format and deliver a keynote speech on June 22. As an important support event of the BRICS Summit, the BRICS Business Forum will see over 1,000 representatives from embassies and enterprises of BRICS+ countries and the forum will release a BRICS Business Beijing Initiative, China Council for the Promotion of International Trade said on Friday. Wang Wenbin, China Foreign Ministry spokesperson, said at Friday's media briefing that BRICS countries have withstood the test of the changing international situation and become an important force that cannot be ignored on the international stage. As the world enters a new period of turbulence and change, the importance of further deepening BRICS cooperation has become more prominent, and emerging markets and developing countries have a stronger desire to participate in BRICS cooperation.China expects to work with the other BRICS countries to deepen cooperation through the BRICS Summit and make a greater contribution to maintaining peace and stability and promoting development, Wang said.A series of BRICS meetings next week will not only be attended by the five BRICS members but representatives of emerging market countries such as Indonesia and Argentina, and observers believe it indicates that the BRICS nations represent the common concept of the world's developing countries and new forces in global governance reform, which pursues independent diplomacy and development paths instead of following the West economically and politically, and explores a fairer, more just and mutually beneficial international order, because being trapped in a West-dominated old order of confrontation and zero-sum games can only lead to endless conflicts and crisis. Wang Wenbin, a professor and executive dean of the Chongyang Institute for Financial Studies at Renmin University of China, told the Global Times on Friday that the West is attempting to profit by turning security and conflicts as the main theme of the world, and the BRICS Summit hosted by China is expected to bring a fresh atmosphere to the world, which includes an equal global governance system instead of the one dominated by the US with hegemony, a new finance reform approach of making finance serve the economic entity instead of weaponizing finance, and repairing the global supply chain undermined by the US which touted decoupling. The US has been seeking to isolate Russia and contain China and spark a Cold War-like confrontation. US is speeding up its so-called Indo-Pacific Strategy in Asia by inviting ASEAN leaders to a summit, visiting Japan and South Korea, excluding China and BRICS countries from the high-tech industrial chain and pushing the world to deviate from the process of globalization, analysts said.  The Russia-Ukraine conflict has a spillover effect globally, including on food security and economy, which has raised concerns from the UN and has posed a severe challenge to most of the developing countries, Su Xiaohui, deputy director of the department of US Studies in China Institute of International Studies, told the Global Times on Friday. The series of BRICS meetings will focus on security and development, Zhu Tianxiang, director of Political Security Center of Sichuan International Studies University's BRICS Research Institute, told the Global Times. He noted that BRICS members will discuss how to achieve a cease-fire as soon as possible for the Russia-Ukraine conflict and advance peace negotiations on the basis of meeting the legitimate concerns of all parties, global energy and food security issues raised by the conflict, as well as the UN 2030 Sustainable Development Goals. Accounting for more than 40 percent of the world's population, the BRICS countries－Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa－account for 24 percent of global GDP and 16 percent of world trade.BRICS members will also respond to the wishes of other countries to apply for BRICS membership, discuss and decide whether to support BRICS expansion and launch consultations on the principles, standards and procedures for BRICS expansion, Zhu said.Argentina has been invited to the summit, according to local media, which said the country has expressed an interest in joining the group. In response to media questions over China's view on expanding BRICS, Wang Wenbin said following the BRICS Foreign Ministers' Meeting in May that the BRICS Foreign Ministers' Meeting backed the expansion of the initiative, while the ""BRICS Plus"" consultations were also held as part of the ministers' meeting, which fully demonstrated that BRICS cooperation is open and inclusive. China will further promote the expansion with all parties involved to establish standards and processes. Analysts said the developing nations also look forward to China's approaches in addressing the global issues and supporting the development of developing nations at the BRICS Summit, as China is the world's second largest economy and the only major economy to register growth amid the pandemic. Su noted that most of the developing countries are dissatisfied with how the West reacted to the Ukraine crisis including shifting the blame and avoiding taking responsibility. They hope to discuss the vast developing countries' concerns on security and development more objectively and rationally, Su said. Not targeting G7 Another bloc meeting, the Group of Seven (G7) Leaders' Summit, will be held from June 26 to 28. US President Joe Biden plans to launch a global infrastructure initiative to counter China's ""international ambitions,"" particularly in the Asia-Pacific, National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said Thursday, according to Bloomberg. The US-initiated partnership will cover global infrastructure, physical health and digital infrastructure, and will provide ""an alternative to what the China are offering,"" Bloomberg said.From the perspective of global governance reform and development, the BRICS Summit is a counterbalance to the global evil trend of West countries in forming small cliques with the G7, but BRICS does not target any developed country or aim at forming a confrontation against G7, Wang Wenbin said.""BRICS stands higher and sees farther than the G7. So if the G7 represents the 20th century, BRICS represents the future of the 21st century,"" Wang Wenbin said, explaining the BRICS Summit stands at the future of human civilization, which is more inclusive and represents a wider range of countries than G7. As for Joe Biden's global infrastructure initiative, Wang Wenbin said it's clearly ""copying China's homework,"" which only proves the correctness of China's Belt and Road Initiative and other global development initiatives it promotes and makes China firmer in promoting BRI.In response to Joe Biden's global infrastructure initiative, Wang Wenbin said that the US initiative ignores the aspirations of all countries for common development and win-win cooperation, engages in zero-sum games and incites division and confrontation, and any calculation to advance geopolitics in the name of infrastructure development is not welcome and will not succeed.

399,"Xi stresses true multilateralism, rejecting decoupling and sanctions at Russian economic forum",GT staff reporters,2022-06-17," By stressing the need to foster an enabling environment for development, China President Xi Jinping pointed out the importance to follow true multilateralism, build an open world economy and reject attempts at decoupling, supply disruption, unilateral sanctions and maximum pressure in a speech at the 25th St. Petersburg International Economic Forum (SPIEF) via video link on Friday.The world is faced with major changes and a pandemic both unseen in a century, economic globalization is facing headwinds, and there are unprecedented challenges to the implementation of the UN's 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, Xi Jinping said as he attended the forum upon invitation.Analysts said Xi Jinping's remarks show strong support for fair and multilateral approach and economic connectivity, when this year's forum is the first since Russia was put under numerous West sanctions since the Ukraine crisis.We need to advance economic globalization. It is important that we strengthen ""soft connectivity"" of development policies and international rules and standards, reject attempts at decoupling, supply disruption, unilateral sanctions and maximum pressure, remove trade barriers, keep global industrial and supply chains stable, tackle the worsening food and energy crises, and revive the world economy, said Xi Jinping.This year's SPIEF, hailed as the ""Russia Davos,"" began on Wednesday and a key focus of the forum is responding to the challenge of the times by addressing issues of economic recovery and international cooperation within multilateral cooperation mechanisms, including BRICS. China and Russia's key participation have sent a strong signal on international and regional affairs, analysts said. When talking about China's economy, Xi Jinping noted that the fundamentals of the China economy - its resilience, enormous potential, and long-term sustainability - remain unchanged and will continue to promote high-quality development.China stands ready to work with Russia and all other countries to explore development prospects, share growth opportunities, and make new contributions to deepening global development cooperation and building a community with a shared future for mankind, said Xi Jinping. 

China President Xi Jinping attends and addresses the plenary session of the 25th St. Petersburg International Economic Forum in virtual format upon invitation, June 17, 2022. Photo:XinhuaYang Jin, an expert at the Institute of Russia, EU, and Central Asia Studies under the China Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times that Xi Jinping stressed the significance of an open and inclusive world economic order and  win-win cooperation, instead of zero-sum game, decoupling and weaponizing sanctions pursued by the US-led alliances.Xi Jinping's address was one of the achievements in strengthening China-Russia economic cooperation even if the West is pressuring China to join their sanctions against Russia. However, Yang stressed that the enhanced economic ties between China and Russia are out of the interests of the two countries as well as the need to realize a fairer and safer global development through multilateralism, which cannot be interpreted as China taking sides in the Russia-Ukraine conflict.Following the Russia-Ukraine crisis, the US and the West have imposed multiple rounds of sanctions and some experts said that more unilateral sanctions in pushing for a new Cold War and dividing the world's economy have not only prompted Russia to ""seek a way out"" but also deeply hurt globalization.On Friday, while addressing the SPIEF, Russia President Vladimir Putin said that sanctions against Russia were a double-edged sword and would only harm the West and he noted that the EU will lose $400 billion for imposing the sanctions on Russia. Vladimir Putin also stressed that Russia is not going to close doors and will continue its course to openness and wide economic cooperation. At this year's SPIEF, Russia-China cooperation has drawn more attention as Kremlin's interests appeared to shift toward the East in the face of mounting West sanctions and pressure, analysts said. China and Russia companies have reached agreements on key industries such as energy, food and other daily commodities on the sidelines of SPIEF. For example, China National Petroleum Corporation deputy general manager Huang Yongzhang held a video talk on Thursday with the vice president of Russia's Gazprom, during which they signed a technical agreement on a Russia-China Far East Gas Supply project to strengthen energy cooperation, a move that experts said would be a further expansion of Russia energy supplies to China.The ""Power of Siberia 1"" natural gas pipeline was opened between China and Russia as early as December 2019, with a gas transmission capacity upgraded to 53 billion cubic meters in 2021.The strengthening of the gas trade between China and Russia is to further diversify the sources of supplies instead of too much reliance on any particular source, experts said.In addition to the signing of energy cooperation, China and Russia companies also signed a number of memorandums of cooperation involving trade in food and other daily necessities as both sides seek to unleash the potential in the cross-border supply chain.""Russia is facing the narrowing of westbound cooperation, and China and Russia will need a huge space for improvement in the field of transportation and logistics, including the further improvement in the capacity of the China-EU freight trains,"" Li Ziguo, a senior research fellow with the China Institute of International Studies, told the Global Times.Analysts noted that as Russia actively seeks to break the West siege in currency settlements, logistics and trade, China companies can ""fill the vacancy"" and China's investment in Russia will also expand at a fast pace.Moreover, Russia and China's economic cooperation will also help boost multilateralism and globalization and promote regional development and stability, analysts said.",CHINA,DIPLOMACY,"Chinese President Xi Jinping attends and addresses the plenary session of the 25th St. Petersburg International Economic Forum in virtual format upon invitation, June 17, 2022.(Photo: Xinhua)",Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'China': ('LOC', 7), 'Russia': ('LOC', 4), 'Ukraine': ('LOC', 1), 'Petersburg': ('LOC', 1), 'Asia': ('LOC', 1), 'Xi Jinping': ('PER', 8), 'Xiua': ('PER', 1), 'Jin': ('PER', 1), 'St': ('MISC', 2), '2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development': ('MISC', 1), 'West': ('MISC', 1), 'Russia Davos': ('MISC', 1), '.

402,"China’s air becomes cleaner now, as carbon dioxide emissions per unit of GDP fall by half from 2005",Global Times,2022-06-18,"Aerial photo taken on May 27, 2022 shows a deep-sea floating wind power equipment ""Fuyao"" in Maoming, China's Guangdong Province.Photo:XinhuaChina, as the world’s largest developing country, has made great achievements in carbon reduction during the past decade, cutting its carbon emissions per unit of GDP by half from 2005 levels. Despite intensifying challenges ahead, the direction of reducing carbon emissions will not be changed and China retains huge potential in developing new energy resources, experts said on Saturday.In 2021, the national carbon dioxide emissions per unit of GDP fell by 3.8 percent year-on-year, approximately 50.3 percent lower than 2005 levels. The total energy consumption sourced from coal dropped from 72.4 percent in 2005 to 56 percent in 2021, according to Zhao Yingming, vice minister of the Ministry of Ecology and Environment.Non-fossil fuel energy now stands at 16.6 percent of the country’s total energy consumption in 2021, Zhao said.The installed capacity of renewable energy reached 1.06 billion kilowatts, accounting for 44.8 percent of the country’s total energy output. Among the renewable energy, the installed capacity of wind power and photovoltaic power both exceeded 300 million kilowatt-hours, ranking the first globally.As a result, the amount of harmful particulates in the air in China fell 40 percent from 2013 to 2020, Bloomberg reported, citing a research by the University of Chicago’s Energy Policy Institute.The improvement of air quality in China’s large cities has been notable. In 2021, the number of blue-sky days in Beijing came in at 288 days, or 78.9 percent of the calendar year, up by112 days from 2013.As the world’s largest developing country, China has realized a rapid drop in carbon intensity – carbon dioxide emissions per unit of GDP – over recent years, and has fulfilled its commitment to the international community, Ma Jun, director of the Beijing-based Institute of Public and Environmental Affairs, told the Global Times on Saturday.China has vowed to reach peak carbon dioxide emissions by 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality by 2060, referred to as the country’s “dual carbon” goals. “Carbon intensity will continue to decrease in the coming months and years,” Ma said.In the meantime, realizing the “dual carbon” goal will not be simple and easy, especially when the world is facing multiple challenges, including COVID-19 pandemic, the Russia-Ukraine conflict and the intensifying energy supply crisis, according to Ma.In recent years, many countries in the world have stepped up efforts to ensure energy security, including China. Energy is the foundation of economic and social development. Fulfilling the premise of ensuring safe, clean and efficient utilization, China moved to release high-quality coal production capacity.Despite the adjustment, the trend of overall carbon reduction will not change, Ma said, noting that China retains a huge potential when it comes to developing new energy resources.The exploitable capacity of hydropower technology in China is estimated to be 687 million kilowatt-hours, of which only 57.1 percent is developed. China governments at various levels have been implementing measures to boost new energy development, and many businesses have also been eyeing the lucrative new energy business. For an example, The government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) has stated its intention to invest an additional HK$240 billion to tackle climate change over the next 15 to 20 years, which will create opportunities for a green economy in many sectors, Christopher Hui Ching-yu, the Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury of HKSAR, said Friday.Ma added that besides increasing investments in new energy resources, it is also important to improve energy efficiency, especially relating to the industrial sector, and to shore up the storage technology for new energy and enhance the construction of a nationwide intelligent grid.Global Times",SOURCE,ECONOMY,Picture description not found,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'Fuyao': ('ORG', 1), 'XinhuaChina': ('ORG', 1), 'Ministry of Ecology and Environment': ('ORG', 1), 'Bloomberg': ('ORG', 1), 'University of Chicago': ('ORG', 1), 'Energy Policy Institute': ('ORG', 2), 'Maoming': ('LOC', 1), 'China': ('LOC', 6), 'Guangdong Province': ('LOC', 1), 'Beijing': ('LOC', 2), 'Zhao Yingming': ('PER', 2), 'Ma': ('PER', 2)}"
403,China-Europe freight train a pillar in global trade,Yin Yeping and Tao Mingyang,2022-06-16,"Editor's Note:In 2013, China President Xi Jinping put forward the ""Belt and Road Initiative"" (BRI), aiming at building a new platform for international cooperation and creating new momentum for shared development. Since then, the BRI has opened a path for high-quality development and common prosperity for countries along the route, becoming a real global platform serving over half of the world's population.While developing rapidly over the years, China has also made great contribution to the world connectivity under the initiative, helping to build a mega global transportation network covering sea, rail and road channels and integrating a number of countries into the global supply chain. The Global Times is publishing a series of stories, helping the world understand how the initiative facilitates connectivity and foster growth. One of the typical examples includes the opening of China-EU freight train. The sixth anniversary of the opening of the train falls on June 20, and the Global Times conducted interviews with several train operators, traders and customs officials, who shared how they witnessed the development of freight transportation under BRI and its increasingly important and indispensable role for global economy.This is the first in a series about a monumental decade for the BRI.When Bao was designated by the government of Yiwu, China's Zhejiang Province, to deliver the first shipment of goods via the cross- border freight train to Madrid in 2014, he was deeply worried as a trader since hardly anyone would believe that a freight train with a mileage of up to 13,000 kilometers across the Eurasian continent could work.Now, the train dispatched from Yiwu to major cities in EU has become the pillar in cross-border transportation, with the numbers of trains dispatched last year reaching 1,277, and is expected to reach up to 1,600 this year, a historic high, compared with just one train in 2014.While the launch periods of the trains were different from place to place, the official naming of the China-EU freight train as a national brand was made by China Railway in June 2016, which was also the most fruitful year for China-EU freight trains. From that year on, its role as a China-EU trade messenger was preliminarily established.It was also in 2016 when the average numbers of trains dispatched from Yiwu to EU was upped to two trains per week instead of one train per month, while the category and value of cargo delivered via the trains was diversified, industry insiders said.From 2016 to 2021, the annual number of China-EU freight trains increased from 1,702 to 15,183, with an average annual growth rate of 55 percent.Moreover, the types of cargo delivered via the trains expanded from mobile phones to more than 50,000 kinds of goods including vehicles and bulk commodities like grain and wood, mostly value-added goods.In the face of the severe impact of the pandemic, the China-EU freight train has bucked the trend and kept growing, with 78 operating lines reaching 180 cities in 23 EU countries.Quantity and quality combinedSpeaking on the occasion of the sixth anniversary of the official naming of China-EU freight train, Bao was excited about how the train service has changed his trading business.The advantages of the freight train center on its high efficiency and reliability as the global logistic hurdles intensify amid port congestion in the US and EU.While there has been congestion abroad, taking over a month by sea from China to Germany only takes 18 days or less by train in recent years, Bao said, which is also a progress from 21 days in 2014. ""Previously, the volume of sea transportation accounted for 70 percent of our entire transportation volume, whereas now more than 70 percent of transported goods from our trading business go through China-EU freight trains,"" Bao said.In addition to shipments, the biggest changes are in the segmentation of clients and value of goods.At the beginning, they were all small business owners, and the goods sent were mainly less value-added daily commodities. But now, the goods delivered via the train are mainly automobiles and electronic devices while clients have upgraded from small business owners to global trading giants, according to Bao.The changes that trains have brought to international trade are visible across the country.Ma Yanyan, a customs broker in Ulanqab, North China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, who joined in the China-EU freight train business in 2018, told the Global Times on Monday that she helped around 100 trains in Ulanqab each year for going through the customs clearance process. ""During 2018-2020, the number of trains dispatched annually witnessed a 20 percent growth year-on-year, and the freight train was a stable channel for China to export various goods amid dynamic global environment,"" said Ma. Ma's company operates clearance service for freight trains dispatched from Ulanqab to EU countries via the Erenhot land port. She noted that China-EU freight train was barely affected by Russia-Ukraine conflict. At Manzhouli railway port, the largest of its kind in China, and the major conjunction of the China-EU freight train, in North China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, the train service has seen a significant upgrade, under the hard work of local customs.To further facilitate the efficiency of port clearance while doing a good job for epidemic control, Manzhouli customs have adopted various measures including 24-hour work shifts and intelligent contactless inspection methods such as cobalt-60 scanned images, an advanced imaging technology, to improve the efficiency of inspection work, Manzhouli customs told the Global Times.Local customs is also in close coordination with other customs along the route to ensure the smoothness of the supply chain.Good trend aheadSince the cross-border train was launched at Manzhouli port in 2013, 15,200 trains have been dispatched from the city so far, according to the customs, and the figure is still rising year-on-year.As the trade demand continues to grow, Manzhouli is set to build a China-EU freight train hub site or assembly center, while the port customs is to carry out cargo grouping business and mixed transportation of domestic and foreign goods in further releasing China-EU freight train transportation capacity, the Global Times learned.Ma predicted that the operation of China-EU freight train in the rest of 2022 will benefit from the good relationship between China and Russia.""Customs in different ports also granted supportive policies to freight trains such as special office hours during holiday and weekends, which simplifies the export procedures,"" said Ma.Driven by the trend of more goods delivered faster, the annual transportation value of the China-EU freight train has increased from $8 billion to $74.9 billion from 2016 to 2021, an increase of nine times, and its proportion in the total trade volume between China and EU has increased from 1.5 to 8 percent.Despite high shipping prices, slot shortage, epidemic prevention and control, and Russia-Ukraine conflicts, the China-EU freight train continues to operate largely unaffected, and has played an irreplaceable role for China-EU trade throughout the period, Tommy Tan, president of Shanghai EPU Supply Chain Management, an agent of China-EU freight trains, told the Global Times.""Non-contact cargo track change, 24-hour high-speed operation, reasonable and stable cost, have all become irreplaceable advantages of cargo trains compared with that of sea and air transportation,"" Tan said.",SOURCE,B&R INITIATIVE,A train pulls out from Manzhouli customs.

404,Rubio resorts to awful bill for media attention under reelection pressure,Global Times,2022-06-16,"Infamous US Republican anti-China senators Marco Rubio and Rick Scott on Wednesday introduced the China Oil Export Prohibition Act, reportedly seeking to prohibit the export of oil and petroleum products from the US to China. ""While gas prices soar across the country, the Joe Biden Administration is allowing half a million barrels of US oil to go to China every day,"" Rubio said. ""This is unacceptable."" ""It's absurd that we continue to export oil to Communist China while US pay more than $5 per gallon of gas here at home,"" Scott said.It is not surprising that US politicians play the xenophobic card in an election year. What is astonishing is how awful this kind of political card can be. This proposal by Rubio and Scott is just one example. Rubio is up for reelection in November and the Republicans are seeking to overturn their razor-thin minority in the Senate during the November midterm elections. According to Lü Xiang, a research fellow at the China Academy of Social Sciences, even against this backdrop, the absurdity of this proposal, which defies common sense, is still astonishing. US has long attached importance to its energy exports to China. During the trade war launched by former president Donald Trump, the US pressed China to import more US energy, including oil. But now, Republican politicians clamored to ban oil and petroleum exports to China. This bill fully demonstrates US politics has been chaotic beyond words. This kind of proposal is even not ""shooting oneself in the foot."" Rather, it's simply ""kicking the stone with one's own foot."" It's ridiculous, and such a proposal will not be reviewed in Congress. If it is reviewed and passed, it means that the US has become a laughable country.US inflation hit a 40-year high of 8.6 percent last month. ""When the normal life of US people is heavily affected by inflation, they must have a grudge. Exploiting such a proposal, Rubio and Scott intend to direct US' grievances to the Democratic Party and China,"" Lü noted. The US' political soil is toxic as it has produced such extreme and irrational politicians. And this kind of politician is not in the minority. They can politicize almost all problems, which will inevitably trigger confusion in the China policy. In this context, the US won't be capable of tackling anything. This also indicates that the US' domestic problems will intensify. Former US secretary of state Henry Kissinger was right when he said the US is more divided now than it was during the Vietnam War.Although Rubio may still win in Florida, among politicians seeking reelection, his advantage is not obvious, so he needs more media attention to boost his chances, the China expert said. There are many factors causing inflation and soaring energy and fuel prices in the US, such as labor shortage, COVID-19 epidemic, the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict, US-launched trade war against China, and the US' rounds of QE. The US only has itself to blame for the current inflation issue.If the US does prohibit oil exports to China, US inflation will become higher, ordinary people will suffer more loss, and will add more burden to its domestic governance. It will turn out only these politicians gain political capital. China is one of the world's largest oil importers. Prohibiting the export of oil and petroleum products from the US to China would undermine US oil companies, and they will not remain indifferent. Such political calculations by politicians like Rubio and Scott are doomed to be unpopular.",OPINION,OBSERVER,Marco Rubio arrives for a Senate Intelligence Committee nomination hearing.

405,China offers important lesson in ensuring food security: WFP official,Shen Weiduo,2022-06-16,"China's efforts in ensuring food security for its citizens and lessons in agricultural production and protection of the most vulnerable people are really important for other countries in Asia, an official from the UN World Food Programme (WFP) told the Global Times on Thursday, while warning that a food crisis in Sri Lanka may expand to more countries in the region.""What we see in Sri Lanka at the moment is that people have started eating less for each meal, they started skipping some meals…so sometimes the mother will first feed her children and the rest of the family and have very little left for herself…"" Anthea Webb, the Deputy Regional Director for the Asia and Pacific Region of the UN World Food Programme, told the Global Times during an exclusive video interview.According to Webb, the WFP has already started its first distribution of supermarket vouchers for pregnant women living in the poorest parts of Colombo. ""That's the fastest way for US to help them deal with a 57 percent rise in the cost of food. We will work with communities distributing emergency food and vouchers so that they do not slip even further into poverty,"" said Webb.Webb noted that the issue in Sri Lanka is built on some quite specific factors, while the WFP is now concerned about other Asia countries as well, warning that ""Sri Lanka may be the first of a number of countries facing difficulties.""""Countries which rely heavily on imported food, which have high debt ratios and whose economy was linked to Ukraine or Russia are most at risk,"" Webb explained.Russia and Ukraine are significant producers and exporters of several commodities, including wheat, corn, sunflower oil and fertilizer. Russia is also one of the world's largest fertilizer exporters. Moreover, Webb said the challenge with food is that it follows the cycle of nature, with no quick solutions at the moment. ""You can't just plant more rice or wheat today and expect to have a harvest big enough to cover the shortfall in time for when you need it.""""Changes take time because we rely on the seasons and because they rely on fertilizer and seeds that are also very expensive at the moment,"" Webb said.Noting that the food crisis is a global problem that everyone is suffering to some extent, Webb also called for all countries and all people to ""find it in their hearts to be generous, and try to make sure that their families and communities are meeting their basic needs.""Commenting on China's efforts in ensuring food security for its 1.4 billion people amid fears of a potential global food crisis, Webb called it ""a sign of determination to ensure that all of its people have access to a healthy diet.""""The rest of the world would be much worse off if that were not the case,"" Webb said. ""I know that if China were to turn to world markets even more, then we would certainly see much higher prices than we are today. So that's really, really important.""China has taken a series of both long-term and short-term measures to ensure food security, with an early agro-layout, a well-established national reserve system, and a top-to-bottom emergency mechanism. China officials and industry players have guaranteed an absolute security of staples, with only 9 percent of the world's arable land.""The lessons that China has generated in terms of what works for agricultural production, for systems that protect the most vulnerable people, are really important for the rest of this region to learn from,"" Webb said.

406,"Russia, China seek new growth momentum at key economic forum amid US hegemony",Chen Qingqing,2022-06-17," With the 25th St. Petersburg International Economic Forum (SPIEF), hailed as the ""Russia Davos"", beginning on Wednesday, Russia-China cooperation under the theme ""New opportunities in a new world"" came under the spotlight, as the Kremlin's interests appeared to shift toward the East in the face of mounting West sanctions and pressure. As a partner of Kremlin with no limits, Beijing could see its investment ""filling the vacancy"" when West businesses withdrew from the Russia market due to political tensions, and more pragmatic talks on boosting trade, facilitating logistics and advancing settlement in local currencies are expected at the forum, also the upcoming BRICS summit. The US-led hegemony underscored by more unilateral sanctions in pushing for a new Cold War and dividing the world's economy not only prompted Russia to ""seek a way out"" but also deeply hurt globalization, making more developing countries realize the importance of using multilateral organizations such as BRICS and the Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU) to enhance regional cooperation, representing an opportunity for regional growth and evolution of the world order, officials and experts said. A business dialogue between Russia and China was scheduled to take place on Thursday as the sideline event of the forum where speakers were expected to detail steps to improve trade and economic cooperation between the two countries, according to Russia media reports. The talk will also focus on the role of central authorities to regional administrations and companies as well as industry associations to achieving the goal of $200 billion in trade by 2024. The annual SPIEF is widely seen as an occasion for attracting foreign investors to Russia, with the Wall Street Journal listing past attendees including JPMorgan Chase & Co.'s Jamie Dimon and Morgan Stanley's John Mack. Amid the Ukraine crisis, this year's event appeared to be less appealing to West investors, some reports said. For example, as of early June, about 2,700 business representatives from 90 countries were expected to attend, far below the 13,500 participants from 140 countries reported in 2021, the AP reported. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov was quoted as saying in reports on Thursday that foreign investors are not only from the US and EU. Russia officials highlight other regions such as China and the Middle East.  China-Russia ties in focus About 40 China companies took part in the forum covering various sectors such as machinery, auto parts and industrial equipment manufacturing. Among them, about ten record annual revenues of over 20 billion rubles ($353 million) and 12 participated offline, according to chinaru.info, a China site providing information on China-Russia cooperation.China President Xi Jinping will make a video address in the plenary session on Friday, along with Kazakhstan President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev and Egypt President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, a schedule on the Kremlin website showed. Xi Jinping and Russia President Vladimir Putin had a phone conversation on Wednesday afternoon, with Xi Jinping hailing the steady progress that the two countries have made in economic and trade cooperation. With the Heihe-Blagoveshchensk cross-border highway bridge opened to traffic, a new channel connecting the two countries has been created. As Russia actively seeks to break the West siege in currency settlements, logistics and trade, in the short term, China companies can ""fill the vacancy,"" as Russia used to purchase in EU and now China firms can take those orders. In the long run, China's investment in Russia will expand at a fast pace, as China investment comes along with technology and those in infrastructure such as gas pipeline would have a great deal of potential, Xu Poling, a researcher at the China Academy of Social Sciences specializing in Russia's economy, told the Global Times on Thursday. ""As its gas pipelines linking EU are gradually restricted, Russia will surely expand toward the South and the East, which will be a focus of China-Russia future cooperation,"" Xu said. Vladimir Putin said in his address to the forum that the West countries' numerous mistakes in their economic policies and their illegitimate sanctions have brought a wave of global inflation, the severance of traditional logistics and production chains, growing poverty and food shortages, TASS reported. And although the country's current task is to strengthen its own economic sovereignty, Russia is not going to close and will continue its course to openness and wide economic cooperation. Whether it's Russia or China or organizations such as BRICS or EAEU, a consensus has emerged to enhance the cooperation mechanisms. For example, countries will accelerate yuan- and ruble-denominated currency settlements, as the process of globalization has been severely damaged by US hegemony, Wang Xianju, deputy director and research fellow at the Renmin University of China - Russia St. Petersburg State University Russia Research Center, told the Global Times on Thursday. ""It signals a new opportunity for regional development,"" he said. 

BRICS Photo: VCGNew order A key focus of the forum this year is responding to the challenge of the times by addressing issues of economic recovery and international cooperation within the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO), BRICS, and the Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU), and those multilateral cooperation mechanisms with China and Russia's key participation have been seeing an increasingly strong voice in international and regional affairs, some experts said, despite the US' continued distortion of China-Russia ties. In responding to the US warning that China risks ending up ""on the wrong side of history"" on the Ukraine crisis, China Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said on Thursday that China has always independently assessed the situation on the basis of the historical context and the merits of the issue. ""We have always stood on the side of peace and justice,"" he said. With the US continuing to push NATO eastward, China has actively advocated a common and sustainable security concept. When the US fuelled the conflict, China has actively encouraged peace talks. People will be able to judge by themselves who is on the right side of history, Wang said. The BRICS mechanism offers the opportunity of taking the development needs of developing countries into account, and more efforts are needed in tackling the economic growth gap, especially in the face of global turbulence, Wang Lei, director of the Center for BRICS Cooperation Studies at Beijing Normal University, told the Global Times on Thursday. ""The aim is not to build a closed small circle, as the spirit of the BRICS countries is to push forward openness and inclusiveness for win-win cooperation. There is no contradiction between BRICS countries promoting business ties and helping to boost a global open economy,"" Wang Lei said. In addition to digital economy cooperation, food security, macroeconomic policy coordination and public health cooperation, this year's BRICS will also focus on local currencies settlements to counter US' abuse of dollar hegemony, experts believed. Yang Jiechi, a member of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee and director of the Office of the Foreign Affairs Commission of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee, on Wednesday called on BRICS countries to inject more stability and positive energy into a turbulent world.BRICS was born in the historic tide of the collective rise of emerging markets and developing countries, and represents the direction of the evolution and adjustment of the world pattern and international order, Yang said. ""As both Russia and China face containment by the US-led West, there could be more motivation to push the BRICS mechanism to advance facilitating trade and investment with concrete measures, which could create a more dynamic circle in boosting regional growth,"" Xu said.",CHINA,DIPLOMACY,"DOM RF CEO Vitaly Mutko, Oleg Skufinsky, Head of the Russian Federal Service for State Registration, Cadastre and Cartography (Rosreestr), and Leningrad Region Governor Alexander Drozdenko (L-R) attend a session as part of the 2022 St Petersburg International Economic Forum (SPIEF) at the ExpoForum Convention and Exhibition Center.

409,"US likely to turn Taiwan island into 'bigger nut to crack' in military talks, but secessionists will find it hard to celebrate its 'cannon fodder' destiny",Wang Qi,2022-06-15,"As a slew of saber-rattling security meetings between the US and the secessionist Taiwan authorities are expected to start on Wednesday (US time), following the recent China-US dialogue between defense chiefs and senior diplomats, China mainland experts viewed it as a scene for the US to further press the authorities on the island to accept US arrangements for arms sales, or even act as a battle front for it. Taiwan media said that a delegation led by the head of the ""UN"" on the island Wellington Koo, is to attend the high-level Monterey Talks next week in US, and three working-level meetings of security officials are to be held from Wednesday to Friday as an ""appetizer.""According to experts reached by the Global Times, as one of the most important military talks between the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) authority in the Taiwan island and US, the Monterey talks are normally attended by retired or active US military officers, as well as representatives from the US Institute in Taiwan and arms dealers. The three working-level meetings are more about talks on strategic collaboration.The talks came after China State Councilor and Defense Minster Wei Fenghe's warning at the Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore on Sunday that the China armed forces will fight to the very end if anyone dares to split Taiwan from China. The talks also came against the backdrop of the Ukraine-Russia conflict, which some US media hyped as offering lessons to intervene in the Taiwan question, which is China's internal affair. Citing sources familiar with the case, the Nikkei reported on Monday that the key theme in the Monterey Talks would be arms sales and military drills. The media said that US, which intends to boost Taiwan's ""asymmetric capabilities"" against the China mainland's landing operation, prefers to offer the island weapons that are agile, as well as anti-ship missiles, air defense systems and  intelligence-gathering systems. Citing a security official on the island, secessionist Taiwan media on Tuesday said the US Marine Corps recently adjusted its strategy, planning to use ""stand-in forces"" to conduct rapid deployment to the ""first island chain."" Taiwan's role in this regard would be a topic during the talks. Although the China mainland always views the use of force as a last resort for reunification, experts said the media coverage of the arms sales and drill preparations suggests that military collusion between US and Taipei is becoming more open, but it is also a signal that US is asking the Taiwan authorities to cooperate unconditionally, even if they become ""cannon fodder"" against the mainland.  For the US, Japan and South Korea could be in its garrison area, or frontline military bases on ""first island chain,"" China military expert Song Zhongping told the Global Times on Wednesday. The US also has the ambition to include the Taiwan island as a frontline military base to contain the China mainland, but the island is unlikely to have a chance to negotiate with the US over options of weapon sales, Song said. Xin Qiang, deputy director of the Center for US Studies at Fudan University, told the Global Times on Wednesday that the US has been promoting ""integrated deterrence"" targeting China, aiming to strengthen the forward military deployment on the ""first island chain,"" and make it decentralized and flexible. The US already has military deployments in Japan, but so far there's no garrison openly in the Taiwan island, so the talks would be a chance for them to further push possible collaboration, Xin said.However, it should not be taken as news for secessionists in the Taiwan island to celebrate, as Xin said that ""it means that the US is already setting up a hypothetical battlefield and that is Taiwan."" ""To put it bluntly, US' purpose for the military talks this time is to discuss how to make Taiwan hold on longer if reunification by force occurs,"" Xin said. ""Since the Monterey Talks are the first since the Russia-Ukraine conflict, the US' next step is probably to turn the island into a bigger nut to crack than Ukraine through arms sales."" The US would figure out how much Taiwan authorities will accept the cruel ""asymmetric warfare"" it has tailored for the island, whether it is determined to become ""cannon fodder"" for the US, or whether it is determined enough to make the China mainland pay more by becoming ""cannon fodder,"" Xin said. In an interview with US media outlet PBS, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken indicated that China is ""aggressively"" changing the status quo in terms of the Taiwan question, which is ""dangerous"" and ""destabilizing."" He said that China should weigh the cost of ""aggression,"" using the example of the Russia-Ukraine conflict.   Song said it's ironic that the US is blaming China for changing the ""status quo"" while constantly supporting the ""Taiwan independence"" forces.""Continuously strengthening substantive cooperation with the Taiwan authorities is a great provocation to the one-China principle. If the US cannot live up to its word in the one-China principle, it must bear full responsibility for the possible deterioration of bilateral ties,"" Song warned. Xin said this time it's different from the relatively low-key Monterey Talks in the past, and the fanfare of the publicity shows that the collusion between the US and Taiwan secessionists has become more open and more brazen.In talks with National Security Advisor of the US Jake Sullivan in Luxembourg, Yang Jiechi, a member of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee and director of the Office of the Foreign Affairs Commission of the CPC Central Committee, said that the US shouldn't have miscalculations or illusions on the Taiwan question and warned that the Taiwan question, if inappropriately handled, will have a disruptive impact.",CHINA,POLITICS,"A view of the Taiwan Straits is seen from Xiamen port, in East China's Fujian Province.

411,"Xi, Putin hold phone call, vow mutual support amid global turbulence",Yang Sheng,2022-06-16,"China President Xi Jinping on Wednesday afternoon held a phone conversation with his Russia counterpart Vladimir Putin, with analysts saying this is a signal to the world that the close China-Russia strategic partnership and high-level mutual trust between the two sides remain unchanged when the world is experiencing turbulence and uncertainty.The NATO summit and the BRICS summit will be held later this month, and the communication between the top leaders of China and Russia is also sending a message to the world that the two major powers will continue to have mutual support on matters regarding their core interests and will keep pushing the multi-polarization of the international order, experts said. There is no chance for the West to use the Russia-Ukraine crisis to instigate China-Russia ties and China's stance with fairness and justice has won the understanding of both Russia and Ukraine, observers noted.  During their conversation, Xi Jinping noted that since the beginning of this year, bilateral relations have maintained a sound development momentum in the face of global turbulence and transformations.The economic and trade cooperation between the two countries has made steady progress, Xi Jinping said, adding that the Heihe-Blagoveshchensk cross-border highway bridge has opened to traffic, creating a new channel connecting the two countries.The China side stands ready to work with the Russia side to push for steady and long-term development of practical bilateral cooperation, Xi Jinping said.The two heads of state also exchanged views on the Ukraine issue. Xi Jinping emphasized that China has always independently assessed the situation on the basis of the historical context and the merits of the issue, and actively promoted world peace and the stability of the global economic order.All parties should push for a proper settlement of the Ukraine crisis in a responsible manner, Xi Jinping said, adding that China for this purpose will continue to play its due role.Yang Jin, an expert at the Institute of Russia, EU, and Central Asia Studies under the China Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times on Wednesday that this shows that the strategic firmness of China to keep developing ties and promote cooperation with Russia in the fields of economy and trade, even if the West is pressuring China to join their sanctions against Russia.On this matter, China is not alone, as most non-West countries, as well as some EU and NATO members, don't share the view to indiscriminately sanction Russia on everything or cut off all cooperation and exchanges even if this comes with a high cost, and there is nothing wrong for the countries  to develop ties with Russia based on the interests of their people, said analysts. China is willing to work with Russia to continue supporting each other on their respective core interests concerning sovereignty and security, as well as on their major concerns, deepening their strategic coordination, and strengthening communication and coordination in such important international and regional organizations as the UN, the BRICS mechanism and the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO), Xi Jinping said.China is also willing to work with Russia to promote solidarity and cooperation among emerging market countries and developing nations, and push for the development of the international order and global governance toward a more just and reasonable direction, he added.Cui Heng, an assistant research fellow from the Center for Russia Studies of China Normal University, told the Global Times on Wednesday that since the beginning of the Russia-Ukraine crisis, the US has fully activated its Cold War asset, and the upcoming NATO summit will adopt a new Security Concept for the Alliance to target not only Russia but also China, and Japan and South Korea's leaders will attend the summit for the first time. ""It's clear that NATO is no longer a military organization in the regions around the north of the Atlantic, but will step into Asia and have global influence, and more importantly, it targets Russia and China as its rivals, even enemies,"" he said.China and Russia have no choice but to jointly resist NATO's all-round suppression through close strategic coordination, and further maintain the balance of the global strategic situation, Cui said, noting that this is the key signal delivered by the conversation between Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin.Yang stressed that the NATO summit is focusing on military and security, while the BRICS summit is focusing on development and the cooperation among the rising economies, so they are different and will not become some kind of Cold War situation like bloc-to-bloc confrontation. But it is important for China and Russia, as well as the rest of BRICS members to send a signal to the world that the international order should focus on development and to ease tensions via dialogue rather than letting a few West countries dominate the international community to make confrontation dominate the international relations.Another important opportunity for President Xi Jinping's phone call with President Vladimir Putin is that today is President Xi Jinping's birthday and the two leaders have enjoyed a deep personal friendship for more than a decade. Mutual trust between the leaders of the two countries guarantees the long-term stability of China-Russia relations, Cui noted.For his part, Vladimir Putin said the Russia side sincerely congratulates China on its remarkable development achievements under the strong leadership of Xi Jinping.Since the start of the year, the practical cooperation between Russia and China has been developing steadily, he said, adding that Russia supports the Global Security Initiative proposed by the China side, and opposes any force to interfere with China's internal affairs using so-called issues regarding Xinjiang, Hong Kong and Taiwan, among others, as an excuse.He noted that Russia is ready to strengthen multilateral coordination with China so as to make constructive efforts in boosting multi-polarization of the world, and establishing a more just and reasonable international order.Russia's support toward the issues related to China's core interests, especially on those which face pressure and threats from the US, is as strong as always, said analysts. The China-Russia comprehensive strategic partnership of coordination is ""the backbone of a multipolar world and plays a vital role in defending NATO's global ambitions and US hegemony,"" Cui said.The multilateral cooperation mechanisms with China and Russia's key participation, such as the BRICS and the SCO, are having a stronger voice in international and regional affairs, experts said. ""A key is that China and Russia are able to provide precious public goods to many developing countries, which have no ideological strings attached compared with the ones provided by the West,"" Cui noted.On Wednesday, the 12th Meeting of BRICS National Security Advisers and High Representatives on National Security was held virtually, chaired by Yang Jiechi, a member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the CPC and director of the Office of the Foreign Affairs Commission of the CPC Central Committee in Beijing. The topics are multilateralism and global governance, new threats and challenges to national security, and governance of new frontiers, China Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said at a regular news conference on Wednesday. National security advisers and high representatives on national security of South Africa, Brazil, Russia and India attended the event.""As the BRICS chair, China looks forward to working with other BRICS members to further consolidate political mutual trust, deepen political and security cooperation, jointly safeguard our security and development interests, and make positive contributions to promoting world peace and stability,"" he said.",CHINA,DIPLOMACY,China Russia Photo:VCG,"Reporter, Beijing","Yang Sheng is a chief reporter at the Global Times covering Chinese politics, diplomacy and military.","{'China': ('LOC', 12), 'Russia': ('LOC', 11), 'West': ('LOC', 3), 'Ukraine': ('LOC', 4), 'Heihe': ('LOC', 1), 'Blagoveshchensk': ('LOC', 1), 'Asia': ('LOC', 1), 'Xi Jinping': ('PER', 6), 'Vladimir Putin': ('PER', 1), 'Yang Jin': ('PER', 1), 'NATO': ('ORG', 2), 'Institute': ('ORG', 1), 'EU': ('ORG', 2), 'BRICS': ('MISC', 1)}"

415,‘Today’s Russia is tomorrow’s China’narrative cannot fool Asian countries,Cui Hongjian,2022-06-16,"Taking advantage of the heat of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, NATO intends to reframe the NATO Summit at the end of June as an opportunity to overstep the bounds of its normal range. In addition to the 30 member states, nonmembers are invited to participate the summit including Sweden and Finland which are interested in joining the organization, and ""partners"" far away in the Asia-Pacific such as Japan, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand. Following the expansion into EU soon after the end of the Cold War, and its involvement in the War in Afghanistan, NATO is eager to take the Russia-Ukraine conflict as an opportunity to globalize the organization.  In addition to the core of transatlantic relations, NATO has painstakingly developed a set of ""partnership networks"" over the years, successively extending its tentacles to Eurasia with the Partnership for Peace, to the Middle East and North Africa with the Mediterranean Dialogue, and to the Gulf region with the Istanbul Cooperation Initiative. Those networks have been the main tools for NATO to expand beyond EU and infiltrate into non-military security areas, as well as the main leverage to fulfill its ""globalization.""  In constructing and promoting the partnerships, NATO has carefully planned and deployed a cross-border strategy. First, NATO starts with regional security issues and gradually breaks through the geographical boundaries through dialogue with its neighboring countries, penetrating into the surrounding Eurasian interior and the southern shore of the Mediterranean. Second, unsatisfied with playing a role only in a corner of EU, NATO wishes to further break through the geographical limitations through cross-border issues. Since the end of the Cold War, NATO has been upgrading its position by generalizing the concept of security, drawing in countries that are geographically separate form NATO but geopolitically vital to constructing a cross-regional network. Apart from traditional security, NATO's current strategic aspects has covered the oceans, cyberspace, space, counter-terrorism, climate and even investment, infrastructure and other areas, with the help of which NATO could enlarge the network.  NATO is not satisfied with the current scale of its network, and desires to involve more countries which can be used as NATO's tool of expansion. This demands firm ties, and the tool NATO has found for this purpose is ""politicization,"" which is one of NATO's reforming direction together with another direction of ""globalization"" almost simultaneously proposed. The core is to forge NATO into a reliable tool for exporting West values, institutions and security concepts. Over recent years, uniting countries with similar values has been a priority principle through NATO's network of partnerships, thus NATO is ratcheting up enthusiasm and attention to some Asia-Pacific countries in its network, and there is a trend to develop them from ""partners"" to ""allies."" Regardless of the security environment, regional pattern or strategic culture, NATO has nothing to do with the Asia-Pacific, as the latter with diverse regional political ecology is not the main battlefield of the Cold War and has been profoundly influenced by the Non-Aligned Movement. There are no historical genes or realistic need for bloc confrontation in this region. However, for US strategic needs, NATO is trying to activate and enhance its ""partnership network"" to participate in security affairs of the Asia-Pacific, therefore transforming the regional security structure.  NATO has found two reasons for its involvement in the Asia-Pacific. The first is to make full use of some regional countries' one-sided perception of the Russia-Ukraine conflict to revive the cliché of ""a strong country must hegemonize, and it's necessary to defend democracy."" The rhetoric of ""today's Russia is tomorrow's China"" is used to raise tension and intimidate regional countries, creating a demand for ""NATO-style collective security"" in the Asia-Pacific. The second is misappropriating the principle of indivisible security to produce specious theories like ""the indivisible security of EU and Asia,"" while the lessons of failure have been used as successful experiences to preach to Asia. With the spreading of such rhetoric, NATO released a dangerous signal with its attempt to develop partnerships in the Asia-Pacific into solid measures, thus destroying the regional security ecology.  If collective security is defined as winning in bloc confrontation, then NATO can call its siege of Russia as a success. But if one considers the essence of regional security is peace, then the Russia-Ukraine conflict and the reignited war in EU is a definite failure. Collective security that is exclusive and confrontational will only lead to more conflict and fear in the Asia-Pacific, and the ""success"" of collective security comes at the cost of the ""failure"" of regional security. There is no reason for Asia-Pacific countries to accept the preaching and seduction of a serial loser.  The author is director of the Department of EU Studies at the China Institute of International Studies. opinion@globaltimes.com.cn",OPINION,VIEWPOINT,Illustration: Liu Rui/GT,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'Russia': ('LOC', 2), 'Ukraine': ('LOC', 2), 'Sweden': ('LOC', 1), 'Finland': ('LOC', 1), 'Asia': ('LOC', 1), 'Pacific': ('LOC', 1), 'Japan': ('LOC', 1), 'South Korea': ('LOC', 1), 'Australia': ('LOC', 1), 'New Zealand': ('LOC', 1), 'Eurasia': ('LOC', 1), 'Middle East': ('LOC', 1), 'North Africa': ('LOC', 1), 'Gulf': ('LOC', 1), 'Mediterranean': ('LOC', 1), 'NATO': ('ORG', 16), 'EU': ('ORG', 3), 'Cooperation': ('ORG', 1), 'NATO Summit': ('MISC', 1), 'Cold War': ('MISC', 2), 'War in Afghanistan': ('MISC', 1), 'Partnership for Peace': ('MISC', 1), 'Mediterranean Dialogue': ('MISC', 1), 'Istanbul': ('MISC', 1), 'Initiative': ('MISC', 1), 'Eurasian': ('MISC', 1)}"
416,UNHCR warns of acute migratory crisis,Global Times,2022-06-16,"The number of people forced to flee their homes has increased every year over the past decade and stands at the highest level since records began, a trend that can be only reversed by a new, concerted push toward peacemaking, UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency, said Thursday.By the end of 2021, those displaced by war, violence, persecution, and human rights abuses stood at 89.3 million, up 8 percent on a year earlier and well over double the figure of 10 years ago, according to UNHCR's annual Global Trends report. Since then, the start of the Russia-Ukraine conflict - causing the fastest and one of the largest forced displacement crises since World War II - and other emergencies, from Africa to Afghanistan and beyond, pushed the figure over the dramatic milestone of 100 million. ""Every year of the last decade, the numbers have climbed,"" said the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, Filippo Grandi. ""Either the international community comes together to take action to address this human tragedy, resolve conflicts and find lasting solutions, or this terrible trend will continue."" 2021 was notable for the number of conflicts that escalated and new ones that flared; 23 countries, with a combined population of 850 million, faced medium- or high-intensity conflicts, according to the World Bank. Meanwhile, food scarcity, inflation and the climate crisis are adding to people's hardship, stretching the humanitarian response just as the funding outlook in many situations appears bleak. The number of refugees rose in 2021 to 27.1 million. Arrivals climbed in Uganda, Chad and Sudan among others. Most refugees were, once again, hosted by neighboring countries with few resources. The number of asylum seekers reached 4.6 million, up 11 percent. 2021 also saw the 15th straight annual rise in people displaced within their countries by conflict, to 53.2 million. The increase was driven by mounting violence or conflict in some places, for example Myanmar. The conflict in Ethiopia's Tigray and other regions has spurred the flight of millions within the country. Insurgencies in the Sahel drove fresh internal displacement, particularly in Burkina Faso and Chad.The speed and volume of displacement is still outpacing the availability of solutions for those displaced - like return, resettlement or local integration. Yet the Global Trends report also contained glimmers of hope. The number of refugee and IDP returns increased in 2021, returning to pre-COVID-19 levels, with voluntary repatriation having surged 71 percent, though numbers remained modest.  ""While we're witnessing appalling new refugee situations, and existing ones reigniting or remaining unresolved, there are also examples of countries and communities working together to pursue solutions for the displaced,"" Grandi added. ""It's happening in places - for example the regional cooperation to repatriate Ivorians - but these important decisions need to be replicated or scaled up elsewhere."" And although the estimated number of stateless people grew slightly in 2021, some 81,200 acquired citizenship or had it confirmed - the biggest reduction in statelessness since the start of UNHCR's IBelong campaign in 2014.UNHCR",WORLD,EYE ON WORLD ,"Thousands of families have been displaced due to recent climate change and droughts in Ethiopia's Somali regions.

417,The US has become addicted to coercive diplomacy,Xin Ping,2022-06-16,"""We'll stand together with others against economic coercion and intimidation,"" said US Secretary of State Antony Blinken. It is interesting that he opposes coercion in a public address. He may think twice before enunciating the ""C"" word if he had revisited history. It was Alexander George, an US academic, that coined the concept of ""coercive diplomacy"" as a US alternative to war in the 1970s. Coercion by the US could come with brute force. In the 1960s, the US fermented a civil war in Laos to subvert the Communist government. In 1961, President Kennedy wrote that ""Laos … is a most inhospitable area in which to wage a campaign. Its geography, topography, and climate are built-in liabilities."" So the US sent bombers rather than troops. For nine years, the US dropped the equivalent of a planeload of bombs every eight minutes, 24 hours a day. Between 1964 and 1973, 580,000 bombing missions were carried out, showering more than two million tons of explosives on the sovereign country. Now, 49 years after the bombing campaign ended, its legacy continues to wreak havoc. Between 1975 and 2008, the 30 percent, or 80 million bombs, that did not explode upon impact have claimed approximately 50,000 Lao lives. Today, unilateral sanctions are the preferred form of US coercion, this approach doesn't produce plumes of smoke but still hurts ordinary people. According to Sputnik News, the US imposed 5,532 sanctions on Russia from 2014 to March 2022, including 2,778 that were put in place after the Russia-Ukraine military conflict began. They have driven away over 600 private companies and are projected to squeeze Russia's GDP by somewhere between 15 percent and 30 percent. To choke off the Russia economy, the US has hobbled foreign companies trading with Russia. Since December 2019, the US has imposed sanctions on Nord Stream 2, a pipeline delivering Russia natural gas to EU. Sanctions were slapped on Germany personnel and companies to force them to suspend the project. After fanning the flames in Ukraine, the US forced countries ""to stand on the right side of history,"" meaning ""to toe the US line,"" in condemning and sanctioning Russia. Otherwise, expect debilitating sanctions. Besides unilateral sanctions, the US has also frequently threatened or employed ""long-arm jurisdiction"" to strangle its competitors. In September 2021, the US Department of Commerce announced that global semiconductor manufacturers like the ROK's Samsung had to submit internal information of their chip inventory as well as orders and sales data. In the name of increasing transparency and addressing global supply shortage, the US government gave the companies 45 days to answer the ""voluntary request."" In an interview with Reuters, Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said that ""we have other tools in our tool box that require them to give US data. I hope we don't get there. But if we have to, we will."" These threatening remarks remind people of the US economic kneecapping of France's Alstom company. In 2013, the US Department of Justice detained several executives from Alstom as ""economic hostages"" to force the France company into a fire sale of its core business to its US rival General Electric. In his book The US Trap, Frederic Pierucci, a former senior manager at Alstom, revealed that he had been detained for five years and had to plead guilty to US charges. The investigation by the US Department of Justice ended in GE's $17 billion takeover of Alstom in 2014. It was ""economic war,"" mused Mr. Pierucci. It took similar, coercive measures against Huawei's Meng Wanzhou only four years later, in an attempt to stall the development of the China technology giant.Coercion has become a go-to tool for US diplomacy. An op-ed in Newsweek once commented that ""US has become addicted to sanctions like a five-year-old is addicted to candy."" When Antony Blinken said in his China policy speech recently that ""many of our partners already know from painful experience how Beijing can come down hard when they make choices that it dislikes,"" he might well be thinking of US's coercive acts against other countries. That statement only makes sense by replacing ""Beijing"" with ""US."" The author is a commentator on international affairs, writing regularly for Global Times, China Daily, etc. He can be reached at xinping604@gmail.com.",OPINION,VIEWPOINT,US hegemony Illustration: Liu Rui/GT,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'US': ('LOC', 14), 'Laos': ('LOC', 2), 'Russia': ('LOC', 7), 'Ukraine': ('LOC', 2), 'Germany': ('LOC', 1), 'Antony Blinken': ('PER', 1), 'Alexander George': ('PER', 1), 'Kennedy': ('PER', 1), 'Communist': ('MISC', 1), 'Lao': ('MISC', 1), 'Sputnik News': ('ORG', 1), 'EU': ('ORG', 1)}"
418,BRICS a global pillar of stability for non-Western countries,Oleg Ivanov,2022-06-16,"During recent times the international community has been witnessing the increasing strategic rivalry between the collective West and a group of states including Russia and China as well as a split between West and non-West world. This trend accelerated after the Ukraine crisis started in 2014 and had a drastic boost after the beginning of the Russia special military operation in Ukraine on February 24. The US and its allies imposed unprecedented sanctions on Russia trying to isolate that country from the global community. However, this policy has backfired. Former Italy prime minister Silvio Berlusconi said that the West had isolated Russia but in doing so has been isolated from the rest of the world. His statement confirms the fact that the spilt between the collective West and non-West world has really widened and there is an ongoing process toward multipolarity. In this context the role of BRICS has become even more important at any stage of its existence for two reasons. First, it is a tool for its participants to preserve their independence in the political and economic decision-making from the West. Second, BRICS is an entity that ensures stability in the world affairs. It is aimed at making a geopolitical split less confrontational and smooth. It is a kind of insurance for the rest of the world when the West makes mistakes and destabilizes the situation.    West entities including the G7, NATO or AUKUS are aimed at preserving dominance of the collective West led by the US. During recent trilateral meetings at the Shangri-La Dialogue, the US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin, Defense Minister Nobuo Kishi of Japan and South Korea Minister of National Defense Lee Jong-sup claimed that they saw challenges to the rules-based order in the Indo-Pacific in very much the same ways and shared determination based on their common interests and common values, to take actions together to bolster deterrence security and stability in the Indo-Pacific. In fact, these futile attempts are designed at pushing non-West states to the global political periphery. On the eve of the upcoming BRICS summit, it is appropriate to look again at this influential entity and Russia's participation. Russia is pursuing constructive goals in the framework of three spheres, namely economic, political and security, and humanitarian areas. Russia leadership shares the common approach that BRICS' activity should be aimed at raising the entity's effectiveness through solidarity and engagement. It should have an inclusive character. Russia disagrees with the West promotion of the world order based on the rules adopted by the West without consent of the non-West countries. Unlike West states, Russia's activity within BRICS focuses on the strengthening of the central role held by the UN, G20 and international law as a whole. In the face of growing strategic rivalry, Russia leaders and their BRICS partners share the necessity to make global governance institutions more representative involving states from the non-West world. It is important that developing countries as well as states with shaping markets should be involved in the global decision-making. In this respect BRICS is a guarantee of such opportunity and Russia will do its best to bolster such steps inside BRICS. Russia is interested in coordination of BRICS's position on crucial international issues at the key international forums. This synergetic approach will be more effective to deal with such issues.     Facing the current economic crisis, BRICS is acting as a pillar of stability in the world for non-West countries. Russia and China came out against illegal West sanctions and believe that BRICS can play a constructive role in resisting US attempts of applying its domestic law to punish disloyal countries. One of the ways to soften impact of West sanctions and outside interference is to minimize using West national currencies in payments among BRICS members. This move can be bolstered by the activity of the New Development Bank (NDB) and Contingent Reserve Arrangement (CRA) that are supposed to give BRICS and developing countries more independence from IMF and the World Bank thus buttressing multipolarity. Russia will promote adherence to the WTO rules that are being breached by the West. It is vital as by doing so BRICS will protect developing economies that are vulnerable to West economic malpractice. The author is deputy head of the International and National Security Department, Diplomatic Academy, Moscow. opinion@globaltimes.com.cn",OPINION,VIEWPOINT,Illustration: Chen Xia/GT,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'West': ('LOC', 11), 'Russia': ('LOC', 8), 'China': ('LOC', 1), 'Ukraine': ('LOC', 2), 'US': ('LOC', 3), 'Italy': ('LOC', 1), 'Japan': ('LOC', 1), 'South Korea': ('LOC', 1), 'Indo - Pacific': ('LOC', 2), 'non': ('MISC', 2), 'Shangri - La Dialogue': ('MISC', 1), 'Indo': ('MISC', 1), 'Sivio Berlusconi': ('PER', 1), 'Lloyd Austin': ('PER', 1), 'Nobuo Kishi': ('PER', 1), 'Lee Jong': ('PER', 1), 'sup': ('PER', 1), 'BRICS': ('ORG', 2), 'G7': ('ORG', 1), 'NATO': ('ORG', 1), 'AUKUS': ('ORG', 1), 'National Defense': ('ORG', 1), 'BRIC': ('ORG', 2)}"
419,"GT Investigates: Western freelance journalists expose NATO propaganda fomenting Ukraine crisis, suffer merciless attacks by ‘civilized’ West",GT staff reporters,2022-06-14,"Recently, reports went viral on social media platforms that a senior Ukraine official was fired over several accusations, among which was the rhetoric she used to describe sexual assaults against children allegedly by Russia without verified evidence. It has sparked the latest round of concerns about the rampancy of disinformation in the Russia-Ukraine conflict.Lyudmila Denisova, Ukraine parliament's commissioner for human rights was relieved of her duties on May 31 over her handling of reports detailing sexual assault allegations made against Russia in Ukraine, Newsweek reported on May 31.According to Newsweek, the move came after outrage over the wording she used in public reports of alleged sexual assaults by Russia but failure to provide tangible evidence as well as alleged dissemination in those reports of unverified information.In the current landscape of public opinion on the Russia-Ukraine conflict, it is not uncommon for the parties stirring up chaos to engage in fake news dissemination. While NATO's reckless expansion remains the major root cause of the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict, NATO member states, as veterans of concocting and spreading disinformation, and some West media have been quietly doing their bit in employing disinformation tactic and fanning flames.  At the UN Arria-formula meeting on the situation in Ukraine on May 6, freelance journalists from many countries including France, Italy, the Netherlands, Bulgaria, and Iraq criticized West media over propaganda employed when reporting on the Russia-Ukraine conflict.  ""I saw the war, yet we cannot speak the truth,"" Sonja van den Ende, a Dutch investigative journalist said at the meeting. ""We are censored in EU.""The Global Times spoke with Sonja van den Ende, Italy photojournalist Giorgio Bianchi who attended the Arria-formula meeting, and John Mark Dougan, an US journalist who is still reporting from Ukraine, all of whom come from ""democratic"" West societies but have been attacked on all sides for telling stories and sharing opinions that are not aligned with ""political correctness"" of defaming Russia in the West on the Ukraine crisis.""The West accuses Russia of generating fake news, while they themselves are also addicted to the use of false narratives and deception as a weapon,"" van den Ende told the Global Times. ""The title, 'Land of the Free' was stripped from the West long ago,"" Dougan said.When NATO's 'press office' envelops EU""It's hard to play the victim while acting like a villain.""After having concluded a lecture on Ukraine boycotted by some teachers and students at a local school in Italy and distorted by the media and having to endure the current barrage of criticism and abuse from the ""civilized and peaceful society"" in which he lives, Bianchi, who returned to Italy after covering and filming in Donbas region, made an impassioned post on his Facebook page. ""At this moment in Italy, but more generally in all [of] EU, encouraging reasoning on Russia's motives in this conflict and the faults of the EU and NATO means being branded with 'Putinism,'"" Bianchi told the Global Times, noting that in addition to the usual condemnation and censorship on the social network, ""Non-aligned guests invited on TV shows suffer real media 'lynchings' and squad-like attacks by journalists and intellectuals."" Because he bravely testified that mainstream EU media is spreading propaganda about Russia-Ukraine conflict, Bianchi said he was made the target of a defamation campaign waged by major Italy newspapers.On June 5 2022, the Corriere Della Sera, one of the most influential Italy daily newspapers, published a list of opinion leaders, politicians, journalists, and influencers, complete with photos and allegedly compiled by the Italy Intelligence Services, which also includes Bianchi's personal information.According to the Corriere Della Sera, Bianchi's name appears several times in the information dossiers that intelligence services submitted to the government on a daily basis. This is done under the assertion of conducting ""pro-Russia political-propaganda activities.""""All of these hypotheses are absolutely false and lack any support of evidence. It is a clumsy attempt to muzzle whoever disapproves of crazy policies by a government that is making the Italy people pay the cost of arbitrarily imposed sanctions against Russia,"" Bianchi said, noting that this witch-hunt climate has intimidated most journalists and intellectuals, who in fact increasingly tend not to expose themselves and express their opinions on the escalation of the conflict, to avoid the risk of damaging their public image or suffer a career assassination. As a photojournalist, documentary photographer, and filmmaker, Bianchi has covered stories in international news hotspots like Syria, Burkina Faso, Myanmar and Vietnam. His photographs have been featured in mainstream West newspapers, magazines, and international exhibitions and have won numerous accolades and awards.Since 2013, Bianchi has made several reportage expeditions to Ukraine, where he closely followed Ukraine crises, from the ""Euromaidan"" protests in 2014 to the eruption of Russia-Ukraine conflict. Bianchi noted that in West media reports, during the current conflict that's unfolded over a hundred days, some unsubstantiated claims such as Russia allegedly slaughtering vulnerable groups, the Russia army's deportation of millions of people to Siberia, or the army having been pushed back and lost a third of its field forces... were in wide circulation.What Bianchi saw on the battlefield, however, is the fact that the West had provoked and exacerbated the conflict in 2014 and even earlier, finally turning peaceful neighborhoods into refugee camps and mounds of rubble. ""Nowadays, it is common to see hundreds of arms raised, desperately grabbing at food thrown from the humanitarian trucks. Ukraine is a huge tragedy and is sounding a huge alarm bell to everyone who wants to believe that peace, wealth, and fraternity can last forever,"" he said. Due to the lack of a real cross-evaluation given the censorship imposed on the Russia media and the almost total absence of independent media in EU and especially in Italy, a campaign to demonize the Russia military is being carried out, Bianchi noted. ""These news outlets have in fact turned into NATO's press office.""""People want to hear the first-hand accounts of witnesses and not the opinions of uninformed individuals paid by large publishing groups to act as stooges for a government that is making highly unpopular choices,"" he said.According to Euractiv, a pan-EU media network specialized in EU policies, nearly half of Italians would prefer not to send arms to Ukraine, and only 29 percent of respondents agree with sending weapons.At present, it is worth thinking about who the victim and villain are.Lies and neo-Nazism run rampant on the battlefield""There are many lies, especially when it comes to the battlefield. When West countries lose their control, they become aggressive in their propaganda,"" van den Ende, who conducted three trips in March to Ukraine's eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions from where she reported for more than a month, told the Global Times.It is doubly regrettable for van den Ende that in Ukraine, through her personal  experience, the Neo-Nazi ideological trend, nurtured and facilitated by the West, has run rampant in the field of public opinion and the dissemination of propaganda.""In a stronghold in Luhansk, together with some colleagues from Germany and France, we have seen some Neo-Nazi Azov Battalion soldiers' belongings, including manuals from NATO and proof of their extreme-right ideology. However, they [the West society] ridiculed my report about the findings, and I was in nearly all the regular newspapers in the Netherlands, where I was portrayed as a conspiracy theorist and has now been turned into a 'propagandist' for the Russia,"" van den Ende said.Van den Ende noted that in addition to the media, West-funded so-called human rights organizations are just as busy playing a vicious role in the current battlefield.Amnesty International, for example, released a report on May 6 documenting alleged war crimes committed by Russia forces when they occupied an area northwest of Kiev, including the town of Bucha. ""The Bucha incident is shrouded in mystery, the real research that needs to be conducted involves both sides, the Ukraine, the Russia, and of course among the civilians, however, here we see that Amnesty International is not an 'independent' organization, but paid by the EU and West governments to pressure witnesses to say they were hurt by the Russia,"" van den Ende said.The West propaganda campaign and the suppression of journalists resemble Nazi ideology, under the false banners of freedom, democracy, and human rights. The wave of this kind of thinking is hidden under far-right forces in Ukraine, a malignant influence which is fomenting further, van den Ende pointed out.""Your fate is in your hands,"" reads a threatening letter that van den Ende showed the Global Times, possibly from extremists, who demanded that she immediately stop her current reporting, otherwise, she would be doxxed, making her ""specific information circulating in the Darknet"" public, exposing her to the full brunt of the crisis in the war zone and the ensuing online crusade.While it's impossible to determine the origin of this letter, van den Ende noted that almost all journalists and political activities that are undesirable to extremist forces in Ukraine, have been listed within a real sanctions list on the Ukraine site ""Myrotvorets"" [the (Peacemaker), a Ukraine website with close ties to law enforcement agencies and hackers. Self-styled as an independent non-governmental organization, Myrotvorets publishes personal information belonging to those who are considered ""enemies of Ukraine."" Going against all the privacy, personal information and data principles, information such as phone numbers, residential addresses, social profile links, and the names of any children and relatives, is publicly searchable through the search portal. In 2015, members of Myrotvorets created a fake website for pro-Russia forces, where the names, emails, phone numbers, and addresses of more than 4,000 international journalists were published soon after thousands had registered, Al Jazeera reported. Just days after their personal information was made public, two pro-Russia figures were shot dead in Kiev. A Ukraine nationalist group claimed responsibility for the two murders, according to the report. In 2017, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights called for a Ukraine investigation into the site containing the digital blacklist, media reported. But van den Ende said she is still currently in charge of her own destiny, because her reports are unadulterated first-hand experiences and there are many more journalists in the field trying to dismantle the West system that is based on lies and war. In her field interviews, van den Ende said she found that Ukrainians had been deprived of many things since the ""second color revolution"" in Ukraine in 2014, when the West supported Ukraine and promoted the proliferation of fascist ideology, and hoped the local people would reject everything related to Russia.""The West countries want to destroy Russia, as they have tried many times in history, but they will finally find that there are no real winners in the mess,"" van den Ende said. Real troublemakers

Photo: ICRecently, a video of US journalist John Mark Dougan reporting on the Kakhovka hydropower plant in Ukraine went viral on social media.In a widely circulated video, Dougan visited the hydroelectric plant on May 25, where, according to West media reports, the Ukraine Army had driven Russia troops away, but what Dougan said he saw was that the Russia army was in actual control of the plant and even prevented certain armed forces from attempting to attack it with missiles, saving people's lives on both sides of Dnieper River from the threat of a dam bursting.The US Marine Corps veteran and former police officer has been labeled as a ""Kremlin-backed propaganda project participant"" by West media when he documented his journey to the war zone and showed his experiences in Ukraine visually through videos on West social media platforms.Dougan told the Global Times that he didn't care how he was defined by the West, because he spoke directly to the people that lived in cities like Mariupol and Donetsk.""My confidence in their credibility is 100 percent, because these were the people suffering, and they aren't going to be dishonest to protect the guilty party. However, most journalists in big agencies, especially West ones, don't have this opportunity. They are given talking points, a direction to follow.""On the battlefield, Dougan said he discovered that bad-faith actors have been compounding the already bloody conflict.West politicians will get paid off from the $40 billion in additional aid bill to Ukraine signed by Joe Biden on May 21. This, in fact, will cause a long-term stalemate in Ukraine, Russia, and even the whole of EU, Dougan said. ""However, many people are taking these US-aided weapons and selling them to terrorist organizations on the black market. As a result, these weapons will be used in the future to kill people in EU and other places,"" Dougan said, noting that it is almost impossible to monitor the circulation of these weapons.   ""It's the evil people who have pushed for this war who are going to get rich from this war. But in the future, these troublemakers will eventually regret it,"" he said.",IN-DEPTH,IN-DEPTH,"Emergency Situations Ministry firefighters extinguish a fire following recent shelling in the Kievsky district of Donetsk, Ukraine on June 13.

420,"Recession fears haunt US, exacerbate yen weakness",GT staff reporters,2022-06-15,"Editor's Note: As the US moves to corner the countries it considers a thorn in its side, with its role as the initiator of the Ukraine crisis and tariff wars raging on multiple fronts, Uncle Sam has not only hurt the interests of many other countries, but has entrenched itself in an inescapable cause of unchecked global inflation. This is the first article of a multi-part series on the US’ exporting of economic crises to the world. With consumer inflation climbing to a record 40-year high in May, the US may have no choice but to swallow a bitter pill of even sharper rate hikes. The aggressive monetary tightening is envisioned to tip the US economy into recession, analysts have claimed, cautioning against the unpleasant repercussions for its allies, especially Japan that has seen its yen-denominated assets take a battering from an unfolding US recession scenario.The global market has been on edge in the past few days, as record US inflation data has stoked fears of a drastic rate hike at the US Federal Reserve's June policy meeting on Wednesday.The possibility of rate increases has added to concerns about recession in the US, which has struggled to curb runaway inflation. A more hawkish Fed that leads global monetary tightening could be a problem for the Japan economy, market watchers said, as a worryingly weak yen in the wake of an aggressive tightening push would lead to severe recession risks.Recession fears spook marketsThe US has recorded its hottest inflation data in four decades, with the consumer price index climbing to 8.6 percent in the year through May.The fresh 40-year high despite the Fed's desperate 50-basis point rate hike at its May policy meeting - the biggest in 22 years - has primed the market for a potential rate increase of 75 basis points at the upcoming meeting.""The Fed hasn't hiked rates by three quarters of a percent since 1994, and tightening of this magnitude is fueling concerns of reduced consumer spending and business activity,"" said a Bloomberg report on Monday. A hawkish stance has emerged among central banks in developed countries, expect for Japan, with an ensuing massive correction for the stock, bond, virtual currency and commodity markets, as the phantom of inflation has haunted the global economy, Wu Weishan Jinduo, head of fixed income at the research institute of Great Wall Securities in Shanghai, told the Global Times on Tuesday.Concerns over a toll on economic activity in the event of sharper rate hikes have roiled the US market and resulted in bond yields surging across the board.The Dow fell for a fourth straight session on Monday, bringing its year-to-date losses to 16 percent, while the NASDAQ has plunged 30.91 percent this year as of Monday.The US 30-year Treasury yield has climbed to its highest in more than three years. In addition, an inverted yield curve re-occurred on Monday, with the two-year Treasury yield topping the 10-year rate again since April. The yield on the five-year Treasury was also 17 basis points higher than the 30-year rate, the biggest inversion in 20 years.Bond yields hitting multiple-year highs and a yield curve inversion are considered precursors of an economic recession.The inversion in multiple parts of the yield curve is an indication that the market is pricing in inflation, Wu Weishan said.The US economy is heading for a recession as early as the end of 2023 or early 2024, according to estimates by Xiong Yuan, chief economist at Guosheng Securities, in April when the previous inverted yield curve occurred.Yen weakness The Fed's aggressive hiking road map has slammed most global markets, and the Japan market has been among the hardest-hit, with its equity, bond and foreign exchange markets all crashing.Japan's Nikkei index lost for a fourth day on Wednesday, closing 1.14 percent lower, amid jitters over risks to growth from US monetary tightening. A selloff is also feeding through Japan bonds and the yen.The Japan currency that has long been billed as a safe haven asset is now one of the worst-performing major global currencies. The yen weakened beyond the key 135 level against the US dollar intraday on Monday, hitting the weakest level in over 20 years. The yen's year-to-date depreciation against the US dollar has been nearing 17 percent. The yen's fall to a fresh 20-year low has been attributed to the Japan central bank's deviation from its developed peers. Instead of shifting to a cycle of monetary tightening, the Japan central bank has maintained an easing policy, Wu Weishan said, noting that the US-led cycle of rate hikes versus Japan's monetary easing has led to the yen's current weakness. If the yen slides to as far as 150 against the dollar, turmoil on the scale of the 1997 Asia financial crisis is likely, Bloomberg reported earlier in June, citing veteran economist Jim O'Neill. Another factor behind the falling yen and a rout in Japan stocks and bonds is sluggish fundamentals in the Japan economy, experts said.Japan's economic recovery is evidently slower than that of the US and EU, in part due to semiconductor and parts supply bottlenecks, the Omicron spread that impeded a revival of Japan's services consumption and rising global commodity prices that pushed up costs, Dong Chengxi, a research fellow with Zhixin Investment Research Institute, told the Global Times on Tuesday.Such woes are compounded by the Japan central bank's continuation of a loose stance while the US hardens toward more aggressive tightening. The EU Central Bank also shifted toward raising rates in July, Dong noted.The resultant weak economic prospects, waning company earnings and massive capital outflows have led to a downtrend in Japan yen-denominated assets, according to the analyst.",SOURCE,ECONOMY,"Photo taken on Jan. 25, 2022 shows the US Federal Reserve in Washington, D.C., the United States.

424,China heading for bumper summer harvest ensuring food security: statistics authority,Global Times,2022-06-15,"A farmer processes harvested wheat in Zhangxie village of Zhouyuan Township in Chencang District, Baoji City, China's Shaanxi Province on June 8, 2022. Baoji city has carried out the sowing of autumn grain after the harvest of summer grain. Photo:XinhuaChina is expecting a bumper summer harvest this year which will lay a solid foundation for the overall grain production capacity, an official from the China statistics authority told a press conference on Wednesday.The summer grain harvest is expected to be strong, laying a good foundation for a bumper grain harvest throughout the year, Fu Linghui, a spokesperson from the National Bureau of Statistics said on Wednesday.He noted that judging from the current situation, the summer grain is expected to achieve a strong harvest this year thanks to overall climatic conditions, scientific and advanced production methods and increased guidance offered to local farmers.By Tuesday, the country had finished reaping summer harvested wheat equal to 256 million mu (17 million hectares) of farmland, accounting for around 85 percent of the total planting area, the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs confirmed.Since the beginning of this year, the intensification of geopolitical conflicts has led to a sharp rise in grain prices. Grain export restrictions from some countries have further exacerbated the tension between supply and demand which has continued to push up global grain prices.Although international factors such as the Ukraine crisis have pushed up the price of domestic grain, the magnitude is significantly smaller than international levels, Fu said.In May, China’s consumer price index rose by 2.1 percent from a year earlier, with grain prices shooting up by 3.2 percent year-on-year.Fu Linghui said that China has placed great importance on food production and security over recent years with its grain output stabilizing at more than 650 billion kilograms for seven consecutive years, with grain stocks relatively abundant. Among the 33 detailed stimulus measures to support economy released on May 31, the country will issue a second round of 10 billion yuan ($1.48 billion) in subsidies to make up for the decline in grain yields caused by rising costs and lift the minimum purchase price of rice and wheat, two major staple grains consumed by households.The State Administration of Grain and Reserves (SAGR) estimated on Tuesday that the purchase volume of grains during this year’s the summer season will be around 65 billion kilograms, remaining at a relatively high level.Given the complicated international environment, Fu said China will continue stepping up efforts to boost grain production capacity with a view to ensure food security, reduce pressure on agricultural production caused by rising prices, and ensure the steady growth in grain output throughout the year.China’s grain production hit a record 683 billion kilograms in 2021, up 2 percent year on year.Global Times",SOURCE,ECONOMY,Picture description not found,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'Zhangxie': ('LOC', 1), 'Zhouyuan Township': ('LOC', 1), 'Chencang District': ('LOC', 1), 'Baoji City': ('LOC', 2), 'China': ('LOC', 4), 'Shaanxi Province': ('LOC', 1), 'Ukraine': ('LOC', 1), 'XinhuaChina': ('ORG', 1), 'National Bureau of Statistics': ('ORG', 1), 'Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs': ('ORG', 1), 'Fu Linghui': ('PER', 3)}"
425,"Asia-Pacific security facing a contest of two mindsets, China’s new security concept will prevail",Zhao Xiaozhuo,2022-06-15,"The 19th Shangri-La Dialogue concluded on Sunday in Singapore. As a nine-time participant who has also attended this year's event, I noticed some differences from the previous Shangri-La Dialogue. My first feeling is that the relationship between China and the US was constantly mentioned during this year's Dialogue. The forum's highlights were the speeches by the US and China defense chiefs and the face-to-face meeting between these two officials. The remarks made by China State Councilor and Defense Minister Wei Fenghe on China's vision of regional order was scheduled for the morning on the last day of the forum. It has received particular attention: we witnessed an almost full house when Wei delivered his speech. China-US military exchanges used to be realized through many channels, but they are disrupted or even halted due to COVID-19 pandemic and US's increasing pressure on China over recent years. In this context, the meeting between the China and US defense chiefs on Friday sent a positive signal. In addition to China-US interactions, it is also worth noting the stances taken by regional countries at the 19th Shangri-La Dialogue. These nations hold different positions and values, but in general, most have clearly expressed that they don't want to take sides between China and the US. This includes ASEAN members Indonesia, Malaysia, and Cambodia. Only states like Japan and Australia have chosen to follow the US to attack China over security issues. Judging from this year's forum, many regional countries are becoming more aware of the risks of a confrontation between the US and China. They are more worried that the clash of two powers will become the dominant concern in the Asia-Pacific affairs, further squeezing the room for regional nations to take action independently. The Shangri-La Dialogue is also known as ""Asia's premier defense summit."" I have observed several Asia-Pacific security trends during this year's forum. First, security issues in the Asia-Pacific region are gaining greater attention than ever. Now it seems Asia-Pacific is almost the only stable region in the world. But as the regional conflicts are intensifying, many are concerned if peace and stability can still be maintained in Asia-Pacific in the long run. This is why participants from so many countries came to Singapore for this year's event despite COVID-19 epidemic. Second, Asia-Pacific security is facing a contest of two concepts, roads and prospects. The US has pushed the idea of alliance and coterie that targets third parties and stimulates security hot spot issues from time to time. As a result, such an approach has clearly led to divisions and turmoil across the entire region. On the other hand, China's idea is to build a community with a shared future for mankind and a ""new security concept"" embodied in the Global Security Initiative.  The competition between these two security concepts will provide the Asia-Pacific region with two different roads and prospects. And what kind of future they may lead to depends on the common choice of regional countries. But both China and the US should be aware that how they deal with each other and their ties will have a crucial impact on the future of regional security and global peace and stability. Third, US seems to merge its alliance in Asia-Pacific and EU gradually. The Shangri-La Dialogue is a forum mainly for Asia-Pacific security issues, not EU ones. And even if there were EU participants, they generally represented France, Germany, the EU, and NATO. In my observation, there were more EU delegations this year than previous years. And when these EU participants talked about Asia-Pacific issues or global security, they have certainly introduced EU's security ideas to regional countries - a sign of integration between US' alliances in Asia and in EU after the breakout of the Russia-Ukraine war. Finally, the Shangri-La Dialogue appeared to be a relatively open and fair event, but this year it has shown a tendency toward becoming a values-driven forum. For example, Russia used to be an active participant in the Dialogue. However, the Russia delegation didn't come to Singapore this year - it was not even invited, as far as I understand.

426,US Federal Reserve needs to raise interest rate by 75 basis points,Wen Sheng,2022-06-15,"If the US wants to contain its runaway inflation wildfire, which reached 8.6 percent in May and is set to go even higher, the Federal Reserve should act decisively and even more bravely to raise the federal funds rate by at least 75 basis points on Wednesday.The world's largest economy is on the cusp of a serious crisis, because the 8.6 percent inflation rate is truly agonizing and frightening - forcing US households to buy less with rapidly shrinking numbers on their pocketbooks, and  businesses  constantly raising prices to offset production and service cost. An economy can never operate smoothly under the weight of such extreme inflation. The economic situation in the US is absolutely dire, which may cause another financial crisis no less than the destructive level of 2008-2009, if the Wall Street stock index keeps bloodletting and the voracious sell-off is not stopped. The policymakers at the US Federal Reserve, the central bank, is proportionately responsible for compounding a series of errors since last year by being too timid is upending its notorious QE (quantitative easing) policy, and too tentative is raising interest rates to stifle the country's inflammatory inflation.  The Fed's response to the pandemic-induced recession in the first half of 2020 by slashing the interest rates to around zero is a big blunder in hindsight, made worse by its purchase of approximately 50 per cent of the country's newly-issued Treasury debt and massive amounts of mortgage-backed securities. In comparison, China, which witnessed a 6.8-percent GDP downturn in the first quarter of 2020 because of pandemic lockdowns, did not cut its interest rates to below 2.75 percent - viewed as the neutral rate for most economies.And, the Joe Biden administration is to blame for the 41-year high inflation rate too. Its $1.9 trillion fiscal spending bill easily passed Congress where Joe Biden's fellow democrats hold the majority, and the fiscal splurge is a primary trigger of inflation. Joe Biden's economic team, for a prolonged time, refused to admit that huge fiscal stimulus is inflationary in essence. Even after inflation started to raise its ugly head in last July and August, the White House wrongly defined it as ""transitory"" or temporary.And, the Joe Biden administration failed to get a grip on people's inflationary expectations, as it did little to distinguish the surging price hikes. For an example, till today, the administration is debating whether to scrap the punitive high tariffs imposed on $360 billion imported goods from China - because it is simply clear the tariffs are actually taxes on US households and businesses, contributing approximately 1.3 -1.6 percentage points to overall inflation. Strangely, the Joe Biden administration is still seeking to cast the blame of inflation on bad luck, or the paralysed global supply chains - which the US government's trade and technology war against China is non-excusable. Recently, the White House also blamed Russia for steadily rising energy and food prices, although the US government had been tempting Ukraine to become a NATO member. Now, it is impressive for the US Federal Reserve to take aggressive monetary tightening measures, to bring the US inflation quickly to below 3 percent to quell inflationary expectations, even though it may bring a short-term recession. Otherwise, the organization's inflation-fighting credibility will be seriously wounded, and the US economy will continue to reel under prolonged inflation. It's the Federal Reserve's duty to fight inflation, whose policy mistakes got the country into the current mess. Now, it must dispel market anxiety over ever-growing price levels through aggressive actions. Raising the federal funds rates by 75 basis points on Wednesday and stating that more will come in the coming weeks and months would send a loud and necessary message. Of course, short-term economic pain is inevitable, but healthy longer-run economic performance requires strictly-tamed lower inflation and a credible central bank sitting at the wheel.The author is an editor with the Global Times. bizopinion@globaltimes.com.cn",SOURCE,ECONOMY,"Photo taken on July 15, 2021 shows the US Federal Reserve in Washington, DC, the US.

428,England trounced by Hungary,AFP,2022-06-15,"England suffered their heaviest home defeat in nearly 100 years on Tuesday as Gareth Southgate's side went down 4-0 to Hungary in the UEFA Nations League, while it was also a night to forget for Italy as they lost 5-2 in Germany.Not since a 5-1 defeat at the hands of Scotland's ""Wembley Wizards"" in 1928 had England been beaten by four goals at home, but they were torn apart by Hungary in Wolverhampton and are now in real danger of being relegated from League A to the less glamorous second tier of EU international football.Hungary had already beaten England 1-0 in Budapest 10 days ago and they went in front in the 16th minute at Molineux as Freiburg forward ­Roland Sallai controlled the ball on his thigh and volleyed in after a free kick was nodded down.Sallai scored again 20 minutes from time before England collapsed, with Zsolt Nagy making it 3-0 from an emphatic strike.Home defender John Stones was sent off and then substitute Daniel Gazdag wrapped up a famous Hungarian triumph with a cool finish over goalkeeper Aaron Ramsdale.Remarkably, Hungary are the first team to score four goals in an away match against England since the Hungarians themselves, with Ferenc Puskas starring, won 6-3 at Wembley in 1953.England have just two points from four games and defeat in their next match in Italy in September would condemn them to relegation to League B.""It's no time to panic,"" said England captain Harry Kane, who dismissed any suggestion that Southgate should be sacked.""It was a night to forget but we've got to take it on the chin. We've got to move forward.""We are preparing for a big World Cup and that's the most important thing.""Southgate accepted responsibility for the defeat.But he called for fans to stand by his players ahead of the World Cup in five months' time.""I totally understand tonight is a chastening experience,"" said Southgate who was the target for most of the anger coming from the stands at Molineux.""What I would say is this group of players have been unbelievable for the country and it's important people stay with them because they are still going to be strong going forward.""England surpassed all expectations to reach the semifinals of the 2018 World Cup and backed that up by reaching the final of a major tournament for the first time in 55 years at Euro 2020 last summer.Hungary are top of League A, Group 3, one point above Germany who leapfrogged Italy thanks to their thumping win over Roberto Mancini's experimental side in ­Moenchengladbach, Germany.

429,Senior Chinese diplomat meets US national security advisor,Xinhua,2022-06-14," Yang Jiechi, a member of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee, met with U.S. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan here on Monday.The two sides conducted candid, in-depth, and constructive communication on China-U.S. relations, as well as other issues of common concern.The two sides agreed to follow the important consensus reached by the two heads of state, step up contact and dialogue, reduce misunderstanding and miscalculation, and properly manage differences. Both sides agreed that maintaining unimpeded channels for communication is necessary and beneficial.Yang, also director of the Office of the Foreign Affairs Commission of the CPC Central Committee, noted that U.S. President Joe Biden has repeatedly told China President Xi Jinping that the US does not seek a new Cold War or aim to change China's system, nor will it oppose China through strengthening alliances, support ""Taiwan independence,"" or intend to seek a conflict with China. The China side attaches high importance to these statements, he said.For some time, however, the U.S. side has been insisting on further containing and suppressing China in an all-round way. Such acts, instead of helping the US solve its own problems, have plunged China-U.S. relations into a very difficult situation and severely damaged the exchanges and cooperation in bilateral areas, Yang said, stressing that such a situation conforms neither to the interests of the two sides nor other countries of the world.China-U.S. relations are at a critical crossroads, noted Yang, saying that the three principles proposed by President Xi Jinping -- mutual respect, peaceful coexistence, and win-win cooperation -- are the correct approaches for China and the US in getting along with each other, as the principles conform not only to the fundamental interests of the China and the US, but also to the common aspiration of the international community. They ought to be fundamental rules for developing China-U.S. relations.The China side is ready to work together with the U.S. side to explore ways and methods to realize this vision, yet China firmly opposes using competition to define bilateral ties, Yang said.He said the U.S. side should correct its strategic perceptions of China, make the right choices, and translate President Joe Biden's commitments into concrete actions, working together with the China side in the same direction and concretely implementing the important consensus reached by the two heads of state.Yang stressed that China takes an unambiguous and steadfast stand in safeguarding its national sovereignty and territorial integrity. China's internal affairs brook no interference by other countries, and any attempts to thwart or undermine China's national unity are doomed to fail, he said.The Taiwan question concerns the political foundation of China-U.S. relations which, unless handled properly, will have a subversive impact, said the senior China diplomat. The risk does not only exist but will escalate as the US attempts to contain China with the Taiwan question, and as the Taiwan authorities rely on the US to seek its ""independence,"" he added.The U.S. side should not have any misjudgments or illusions, Yang said, adding that it must abide by the one-China principle and the stipulations in the three China-U.S. joint communiques and handle the Taiwan question in a prudent and proper way.Yang also stated China's solemn position on issues concerning Xinjiang, Hong Kong, Tibet, the China Sea, as well as human rights and religion.He stressed that the U.S. side ought to have benign interactions with the China side and make concerted efforts in promoting prosperity, stability, and development in the Asia-Pacific region.The two sides also exchanged views on international and regional issues such as Ukraine and the Korean Peninsula nuclear issue.",CHINA,DIPLOMACY,China US,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'Yang Jiechi': ('PER', 5), 'Jake Sullivan': ('PER', 1), 'Joe Biden': ('PER', 2), 'Xi Jinping': ('PER', 2), 'Political Bureau of': ('ORG', 1), 'Communist Party of China': ('ORG', 1), 'CPC': ('ORG', 1), 'Central Committee': ('ORG', 1), 'Office of': ('ORG', 1), 'Foreign Affairs Commission': ('ORG', 1), 'CPC Central Committee': ('ORG', 2), 'U': ('LOC', 9), 'S': ('LOC', 9), 'China': ('LOC', 16), 'US': ('LOC', 4), 'Taiwan': ('LOC', 1), 'Cold War': ('MISC', 1)}"

Both of them said it is necessary and beneficial to keep communication channels open.Yang noted that US President Joe Biden had repeatedly stated that the US has no intention to seek a new Cold War or change China's system, that the revitalization of US alliances is not anti-China, that the US does not support ""Taiwan independence,"" and that it is not looking for conflict or confrontation with China.However, the reality is that the US has been determined to step up all-round containment and repression against China for some time now. It doesn't solve US' domestic problems, but plunged China-US relations into a very difficult situation, greatly damaging bilateral exchanges and cooperation.Such a situation is not in the interests of China, the US and the rest of the world, Yang noted.Yang is a member of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee and director of the Office of the Foreign Affairs Commission of the CPC Central Committee.China-US relations are at a critical crossroads, Yang said, notingthatChina is willing to approach China-US relations based on mutual respect, peaceful coexistence and win-win cooperation. China firmly opposes defining China-US relations as competition.The senior China diplomat said the US should correct its strategic perception of China to make the right choice, and adopt concrete actions to meet China half-way.In their talks,Yang stressed the Taiwan question concerns political foundation of China-US relations. It will have disruptive impacts if it is inappropriately handled.The US shouldn't have miscalculation or illusion on this. It must abide by the One-China principle and the provisions of the three China-US joint communiques, and handle Taiwan related questions carefully and properly.China's position on safeguarding national sovereignty and territorial integrity is unequivocal and firm. China's internal affairs brook no interference from other countries. Any attempt to obstruct or undermine China's national unity will be doomed to fail, Yang said.The US should have positive interactions with China and make joint efforts for the prosperity, stability and development of the Asia-Pacific region.In their talks, Yang also expressed China's solemn position on Xinjiang, Hong Kong, Xizang, the China Sea, human rights, religion and other issues.

431,Update: Yang-Sullivan meeting draws bottom line for US,Chen Qingqing,2022-06-14,"China and US senior diplomats met face-to-face for the fourth time in a year as tensions across the Taiwan Straits intensified due to US's misconception of its China policy. The latest meeting drew the bottom line again for the US to change its miscalculation over the core interests of China, and such frequent high-level interactions sounded a positive signal for managing China-US relations properly while the US government was urged to abandon its empty talks and to turn its four ""do nots"" and one ""no intention"" into actions. In a four-hour meeting in Luxembourg, Yang Jiechi, a member of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee and director of the Office of the Foreign Affairs Commission of the CPC Central Committee, told US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan that the US shouldn't have miscalculations or illusions on the Taiwan question and Yang warned that if the question is inappropriately handled, it would have a disruptive impact because it concerns the political foundation of China-US relations. As the US had expressed multiple times that ""it does not seek a new Cold War with China; it does not aim to change China's system; the revitalization of its alliances is not targeted at China; the US does not support 'Taiwan independence'; and it has no intention to seek a conflict with China,"" Yang urged the US to turn those four ""do nots"" and one ""no intention"" into actions as the US' consistent increase of its containment of China won't solve its own problems and will only put China-US relations into an extremely difficult situation. The latest high-level interaction came just three days after the first face-to-face meeting in two and half years between China and US defense chiefs in Singapore, where which China's firm position on the Taiwan question was also reiterated. The Yang-Sullivan meeting was not announced in advance, as some US media reported, and was described as candid, in-depth and productive. The meeting was not announced in advance probably because there were uncertainties about how it would be carried out, and whether the two sides could reach any consensus, a Beijing-based expert on diplomacy told the Global Times on Tuesday. ""To keep the meeting low profile would also make it practical and help it yield concrete results,"" he said on condition of anonymity. Yang and Sullivan had met face-to-face three times over the past 15 months. Following an intensive and unprecedented face-to-face confrontation in Alaska in March 2021, the two senior diplomats held talks in Switzerland last October ahead of the virtual meeting between the top leaders of the two countries the following month. In March, they had seven-hour talks in Italy focused on the Russia-Ukraine crisis. The latest meeting was also held after US President Joe Biden's Asia trip that was widely seen as US's concrete efforts to build an ideology-driven small clique in containing China. The Yang-Sullivan meeting, held before a scheduled NATO meeting at the end of June, was seen by some China experts to have delivered a strong message to US that it should quickly, effectively and concretely adjust its wrong and extreme China policy of forming small cliques in both Asia and EU. To fulfill the promises Some China experts believe that the latest face-to-face meeting is part of a series of high-level interactions between the US and China as bilateral relations are now at a critical crossroads, and the US was urged to fulfill its promises in handling the relations, as its wrong and extreme deeds have put the relations into an extremely difficult situation. ""The four 'do nots' and one 'no intention' aim to stabilize China-US relations, which also lays a foundation for cooperation between the two countries,"" the Beijing-based expert said. Joe Biden reiterated that the US ""does not seek a new Cold War with China, does not aim to change China's system, the revitalization of its alliances is not targeted at China and the US does not support 'Taiwan independence'"" during the virtual meeting with China President Xi Jinping last November, and claimed that the US has no intention of seeking conflict with China. In a video call between the two top leaders, Joe Biden reiterated such stance, and Secretary of State Antony Blinken also included those points in his recent China policy address. However, the US apparently failed to fulfill its promises as it continued colluding with its allies through AUKUS and Quad to contain China, provoking the conflicts by supporting the secessionists in Taiwan with controversial arms sales to the island, and constantly slandering China over ""human rights,"" China's Hong Kong and Xinjiang regions. ""China-US relations standing at a critical crossroads also showed that the US should stop going further down the wrong path, and it's urgent for it to effectively and concretely adjust its China policy,"" Diao Daming, associate professor at the Renmin University of China, told the Global Times on Tuesday. To adjust the policy, it's necessary to turn those four ""do nots"" and one ""no intention"" into actions, Diao said. NATO will hold a meeting in Madrid by the end of June. ""It's necessary for US to make such clear representation to the US,"" Diao said.Taiwan in focus During the meeting, Yang warned that the US shouldn't have miscalculations or illusions on the Taiwan question. The Taiwan question concerns the political foundation of China-US relations, and if it is not handled properly, it will have a disruptive impact.This risk not only exists but also will continue to grow as the US has been engaging in using the Taiwan question to contain China, and Taiwan authorities now rely on the US to seek secessionism, Yang said.On the Taiwan question, China's State Councilor and Defense Minister Wei Fenghe told US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin on Friday in Singapore that the China military won't hesitate to fight anyone who dares to separate the island of Taiwan from China. ""Maintaining regular meetings between senior diplomats and top military officers of the two sides is also helpful in managing current China-US relations,"" the above-quoted expert on diplomacy told the Global Times on Tuesday.The face-to-face communication also showed that the two sides have a strong will to keep China-US relations stable by maintaining the bottom line, as communication that is not timely will lead to a possibility of misjudgment that both sides want to avoid, the expert said. Keeping China-US communication channels open is necessary and beneficial, China Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said during a routine press conference on Tuesday. While some US media hinted that the latest meeting could pave the way for a potential meeting between Joe Biden and Xi Jinping, Wang said there's no information to provide in response to a question at the press conference. Using high-level dialogue to promote the stability of China-US relations, especially to better manage China-US economic and trade relations, is crucial for the Joe Biden administration to cope with domestic pressure, Zhao Minghao, a senior research fellow at the Charhar Institute and an adjunct fellow at the Chongyang Institute for Financial Studies at Renmin University of China, wrote in an article for the Global Times. The US needs China not only to cope with its domestic issues such as record-high inflation, but also on diplomacy in dealing with issues such as the Ukraine crisis and Korean Peninsula nuclear issues, Zhao said, noting that if there is ""big trouble"" in EU and Asia, the Joe Biden administration's foreign policy will look bad.",CHINA,POLITICS,"Yang Jiechi (1st R), a member of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee and director of the Office of the Foreign Affairs Commission of the CPC Central Committee, meets with U.S. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan (1st L) in Luxembourg, on June 13, 2022.(Photo: Xinhua)","Reporter, Beijing","Chen Qingqing co-leads the Global Times China desk.

432,China containment strategy will make US domestic issues worse,Zhao Minghao,2022-06-14,"Yang Jiechi, a member of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee and director of the Office of the Foreign Affairs Commission of the CPC Central Committee, met with US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan in Luxembourg on Monday. The two sides agreed to follow the important consensus reached by the two heads of state, step up contact and dialogue, reduce misunderstanding and miscalculation, and properly manage differences. The talks, which lasted four-and-a-half hours, included ""candid, substantive, and productive"" discussion of a number of issues, according to the White House. Obviously, the high-level dialogue between China and the US is becoming more and more intensive, which may indicate a ""window period"" for a phase of détente in  relations. The conversations between Yang and Sullivan show that both sides are willing to inject an element of ""stability and certainty"" into the  relationship. Both countries face very important domestic political agendas this year, as the CPC will convene its 20th National Congress in Beijing, and the US midterm congressional elections will be held in November when US President Joe Biden and the Democratic Party will mark its ""mid-semester"" in office.  Needless to say, Joe Biden is under increasing pressure. Recently, under the influence of high domestic inflation, a falling stock market, recurring epidemic and frequent shootings, Joe Biden's public approval rating has fallen to about 36 percent, a new low since taking office.  Undoubtedly, promoting stability in  relations with high-level dialogue, especially better control of  economic and trade relations, is crucial for the Joe Biden administration to deal with domestic pressures. US inflation has recently hit a 40-year high of 8.6 percent. There are calls in the US for the Joe Biden administration to remove punitive tariffs on China exports as soon as possible to reduce inflationary pressures and ease the burden of inflation on average US. This shows again that the US will find it more challenging to solve the problems at home if it insists on increasing its containment of China. The US also needs China's diplomatic support. International and regional issues, such as the Ukraine crisis and the Korean Peninsula nuclear issue, were discussed in the recent meeting between Yang and Sullivan. As the military conflict between Russia and Ukraine drags on, countering Russia is becoming an increasingly heavy ""strategic burden"" for US. At the same time, aid to Ukraine costing tens of billions of dollars has clearly increased the fiscal pressure on the US. In addition, the Joe Biden administration fears North Korea will launch a new round of nuclear weapons and ballistic missile tests. If there are ""major geopolitical problems"" in EU and Asia, Joe Biden's report card on foreign policy will definitely look grim. Moreover, the Taiwan question drives the intensive dialogue between China and US top-level officials. In recent years, this question has become the focus of the game between the two great powers after US enhanced its strategic competition with Beijing. The US has been recklessly implementing the strategy of ""using Taiwan to contain the China mainland"" and hyping groundless accusations, including ""the mainland will attack the island of Taiwan before 2027."" Yang told Sullivan in all seriousness that the Taiwan question concerns the political foundation of  relations, and if it is not handled properly, will have a subversive impact. China Defense Minister Wei Fenghe, who recently attended the 19th Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore, also sent a stern warning to US that the China military will resolutely counter any attempt for ""Taiwan independence."" To some extent, this proves the competition between China and the US over the Taiwan question is intensifying. Amid the Russia-Ukraine conflict, some US politicians have clamored to ""protect Taiwan by force"" and declare ""strategic clarity."" They try to step over the redline - the one-China principle, which sends a wrong signal to Taiwan secessionists. Apart from that, US has strengthened its cooperation with its allies, including Japan and Australia, in an attempt to exert coordinated pressure on China over the Taiwan question. As Yang stated,  relations are at a critical crossroads and the three principles - mutual respect, peaceful coexistence, and win-win cooperation - are the correct approaches for China and the US when it comes to getting along with each other. US President Joe Biden repeatedly told China President Xi Jinping that the US does not seek a new Cold War with China; it does not aim to change China's system; the revitalization of its alliances is not targeted at China; the US does not support ""Taiwan independence""; and it has no intention to seek a conflict with China.  In order to bring  relations back on the right track of stable development, the US side should correct its strategic understanding of China, translate words into actions. This is not only in line with the fundamental interests of both the China and US peoples, but also conforms to the general aspirations of the international community. It is also beneficial to China, the US, and the world.  The author is a senior research fellow at the Charhar Institute and an adjunct fellow at the Chongyang Institute for Financial Studies at Renmin University of China. opinion@globaltimes.com.cn",OPINION,VIEWPOINT,China-US,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'Yang Jiechi': ('PER', 3), 'Jake Sullivan': ('PER', 3), 'Joe Biden': ('PER', 5), 'Political Bureau of': ('ORG', 1), 'Communist Party of China': ('ORG', 1), 'CPC': ('ORG', 2), 'Central Committee': ('ORG', 1), 'Office of the Foreign Affairs Commission': ('ORG', 1), 'CPC Central Committee': ('ORG', 3), '20th National Congress': ('ORG', 1), 'Democratic Party': ('ORG', 1), 'US': ('LOC', 10), 'Luxembourg': ('LOC', 1), 'White House': ('LOC', 1), 'China': ('LOC', 4), 'Beijing': ('LOC', 1), 'Ukraine': ('LOC', 2), 'Russia': ('LOC', 2), 'Korean': ('MISC', 1)}"
433,US self-inflicted economic woes trigger global stock sell-off,Xie Jun,2022-06-14," China's stock markets stabilized quickly on Tuesday after a short period of panicked selling, as China mainland A shares rose against the stream of an overnight Wall Street share plunge and the ensuing nosedive on global stock markets. Market observers said the rise in mainland shares is an extremely encouraging signal of China's ability to withstand, if not being entirely immune to, blows from US economic fluctuations, as market confidence was consolidated recently by China's improving economic data and the China government's forceful rollout of supportive policies to help the economy get back on track.By the end of trading on Tuesday, the benchmark Shanghai Composite Index rose by 1.02 percent to 3,288.91 points, while the Shenzhen market edged up by 0.2 percent to 12,023 points. Both markets opened lower, and the Shanghai index slipped below 3,200 points during the morning session at one point.Safe haven The A-share market's decline in the morning was interpreted by market analysts as being triggered by a mood of panic after US stock markets experienced an overnight bloodshed. On Monday, Wall Street's S&P 500 tumbled by 3.9 percent to a new low this year in what overseas media described as entering a bear market and the Dow Jones fell more than 875 points. The NASDAQ slid 4.7 percent.The tumble was an instant reaction to the news that the surging inflation in the US is yet to peak, which could prompt the US Federal Reserve to hike interest rates by three-quarters of a point this week, several US media outlets reported.It is worth noting that mainland stock markets are one of the few markets in major global economies to report a rise despite the US stock rout. The Nikkei 225 Index was down 1.32 percent as of press time, the KOSPI Index in South Korea was down 0.46 percent. Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index rose by 0.065 percent on Tuesday. The stability and resilience of China's stock markets are a vivid reflection of global investor confidence in China's economy, as they are pouring capital into the market which they depict as having the least risks for hedging against risks in other markets, experts said. ""The US and EU economies have not performed well, while the continuous economic competitiveness of the Japan market is also being questioned with the yen exchange rate plunging. In comparison, the China market is currently a low-risk market with the most certainty in the world,"" veteran macro economist Tian Yun  told the Global Times on Tuesday. The ""certainty"" and preferably the bright prospects of China's economy have already been reflected in some improving economic data in May, such as a 57.6 percent month-on-month growth in car sales, as well as PMI data, which rose 2.2 percentage points to 49.6 compared with April's 47.4, according to the National Bureau of Statistics. Besides, the easing of the coronavirus situation, in addition to the government's forceful arrangement of stimulus policies, which are being rolled out in a concentrated manner, add to market anticipations for a further economic rebound, experts said. One reflection of such anticipation is the continued inflow of overseas capital to the mainland markets. On Tuesday, about 3.95 billion yuan ($587 million) flowed into the mainland markets via stock link programs. ""Theoretically, interest rate hikes in the US would cause capital to flow out from China back to the US. But this might not happen this time, as investors have more confidence in the China market than in the US, when US financial assets from stocks to bonds are dropping in price,"" Hu Qimu, chief research fellow at the Sinosteel Economic Research Institute, told the Global Times on Tuesday. According to Hu, the major influence of rising inflation in the US on China should fall on the trade sector, as the US is a major source of China's overseas demands. But the impact would still be limited as China has been mounting efforts to reduce reliance on foreign trade, while the central government has launched a series of policies to support trade companies, such as emphasizing the equality of the internal/external trade system, which would help companies sell more easily to domestic customers to replenish any foreign trade loss. Dong Shaopeng, a senior research fellow at the Chongyang Institute for Financial Studies at the Renmin University of China, told the Global Times on Tuesday that although China will be affected by US stock market fluctuations and the measures to ease the US' high inflation, the pressure is limited and mostly showing on investors' mentality instead of on the real economy. ""China has implemented a loose monetary policy since the Donald Trump administration, while its fiscal resources are relatively abundant,"" Dong said. ""Besides, China is able to obtain financial resources from various fields in the public sector, which is our systemic advantage."" Economic recessionExperts noted that many of the US' economic problems, like rising inflation, are caused in part by the country's own policies, and the US will have to taste its own medicine when the aftermath of such policies is prolonged. For example, the Russia-Ukraine conflict, in which the US plays a leading role in intensifying by such means as sanctions against Russia, are causing a rise in global energy commodity prices. ""The US government does not have the capacity to persuade its domestic energy companies to increase supplies or expand production, nor could the US government stop the spread of energy price inflation to the consumption end. Therefore, its residents have to bear the hiking energy prices,"" Hu said. The US' penalty tariffs on China goods, as well as the Fed's quantitative easing policies after the pandemic first broke out in the US, also led to the inflation, experts said. According to Hu, interest rate hikes might help solve inflation problems to a certain extent, but they will bring about new problems, such as suppressing consumption that is supposed to be a major pillar for economic recovery. The financial sector will also be hit by the policy. Citing problems like these, economists in China and abroad are pessimistic on US economic prospects. For example, Morgan Stanley CEO James Gorman said Monday at a financial conference that he saw a 50-50 odds of a US recession ahead, according to CNBC report on Tuesday.Dong Shaopeng said that a recession in the US is inevitable, as inflation without a solution will cause stagflation and further drag down economic growth speed. An expert, who preferred to remain unnamed, told the Global Times on Tuesday that he thinks the US will have to struggle to get out of trouble, when the country faces both a chaotic international order and unexpected challenges like the coronavirus, in addition to twisted, shortsighted policies, like their trade policies toward China.",SOURCE,ECONOMY,"Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) on May 18, 2022 in New York City.

434,AUKUS settlement reveals Australia being unrealistic about China ties,Global Times,2022-06-12,"n Prime Minister Anthony Albanese announced on Saturday a $583 million settlement, which is ""fair and equitable,"" over a controversial decision last year to scrap the France submarine deal, an apparent move to repair the rift between the two countries.  Essentially, the large payment, which is nearly enough to afford a Kilo-class or Type 209 submarine, is a result of the US effort to advance the AUKUS alliance and shows that  has completely abandoned this military cooperation with France. Albanese is following the footsteps of his predecessor in this regard, that is, to strengthen military ties with the US and UK. Albanese claimed that given the ""gravity of the challenges"" that  and France face both in the region and globally, it is essential that both countries once again ""unite to defend our shared principles and interests."" The statement reflects that the new n government is still under the manipulation of the US and sees China as a threat and a major adversary. According to Song Zhongping, a China military expert and TV commentator, 's unshakable consideration of China as an important imaginary enemy is rooted in the US' control of the AUKUS alliance and 's position in the US' blueprint as the backbone of its Indo-Pacific strategy. In addition, there are so-called common values and ideologies between the US and , let alone 's ambition to become a global power through the US that makes it difficult to properly position itself. The result is a wrong estimation of China- relations, which is based on the premise of the relationship between  and the US. A healthy China- relationship must be independent of any other bilateral relations, must transcend ideology or values, and develop a broad consensus on many issues. However, despite Canberra's previous olive branch which n Trade Minister Don Farrell extended to Beijing to restore trade ties, remarks by n Deputy Prime Minister and Defense Minister Richard Marles sent bleak signals. In a speech at the Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore on Saturday, Marles emphasized the country's support for ""regional security and stability based on rules,"" claiming that  does not question the right of any country to modernize their military capabilities consistent with their interests and resources, but ""large-scale military build-ups must be transparent."" According to Song, this reflects that  is unrealistic and not objective in dealing with China- relations. Canberra is still taking the US view of international security and order to lecture China. The US is determined to use  as a frontline country to achieve the forward movement of US military power by promoting the Pacific Deterrence Initiative, in spite of the alleged cooperation with allies to protect common interests. But how is it possible for a country which has turned its back on countries like Ukraine, Afghanistan and Syria to value the interest of its allies like ? Marles affirmed in Singapore that there will be no cuts to n defense spending. The Albanese government has committed to spending 2 percent of GDP on defense, of which AUKUS will be central. Of course, behind this large spending on defense is pressure from the US, since a huge amount of the n expenditure will be used to purchase US weapons and equipment, Song said. Canberra needs to think carefully about who benefits most from the China and Russia threat theory that the US hypes. It is not that  is really threatened by the two countries, but the US arms dealers are beyond happy as a large amount of dollars flow into their pockets.",OPINION,OBSERVER,Australia,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'Anthony Albanese': ('PER', 3), 'Song Zhongping': ('PER', 2), 'Don Farrell': ('PER', 1), 'Richard': ('PER', 1), 'France': ('LOC', 3), 'US': ('LOC', 10), 'UK': ('LOC', 1), 'China': ('LOC', 7), 'Pacific': ('LOC', 1), 'Canberra': ('LOC', 2), 'Beijing': ('LOC', 1), 'Singapore': ('LOC', 1), 'Kilo': ('MISC', 1), 'Type 209': ('MISC', 1), 'AUKUS': ('MISC', 2), 'Indo -': ('MISC', 1), 'Shan': ('ORG', 1)}"
435,China harvests around 78.5% of winter wheat with bumper output,Ma Jingjing and Song Lin,2022-06-12,"China's summer harvest is being carried out at full swing, with a bumper harvest expected thanks to a variety of policies and incentives such as one-off subsidies and a higher grain purchase price, helping guarantee the country's food security amid volatile global food market.As of Sunday, the country had finished reaping winter wheat on 239 million mu (15.93 million hectares) of farmland, accounting for around 78.5 percent of its total winter wheat, 1.2 percentage points faster than the previous year, according to the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs.Wheat harvesting in Central China's Henan Province and China's Jiangsu Province has almost come to a close, while harvesting in China's Shaanxi, China's Shandong and North China's Shanxi provinces is in full swing.The epidemic did not slow the overall harvesting process, and areas that have completed harvesting so far have seen rosy outputs, with most seeing the highest yields in recent years, Jiao Shanwei, editor-in-chief of industry news website cngrain.com, told the Global Times on Sunday.The quality of the summer wheat is above expectations as well, including crops from Anhui, Hubei and Henan provinces, Jiao said, stressing that the hard-won summer grain production has laid the foundation for a good harvest for the year.China's summer harvesting mainly focuses on winter wheat and oilseed rape. Generally spanning from May to late June, grain production in the period accounts for about one-quarter of the annual total, and therefore it is of great significance to the country's food security.At a recent meeting, China Premier Li Keqiang reiterated that the summer harvest is important to attaining the country's annual grain output goal. He called for smooth logistics for agricultural equipment and personnel, and urged governments at all levels to ""waste no time and leave no single grain unharvested"" during the harvesting season.This year, the country has pledged to keep grain output above 650 billion kilograms. To achieve this, China has rolled out a variety of policies and incentives, such as increasing the amount of one-off subsidies and expanding the coverage of plantation insurance, said Li Guoxiang, a research fellow at the Rural Development Institute under the China Academy of Social Sciences.On Friday, the Ministry of Finance (MOF) and the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs announced 34 measures to support farmers and farming in 2022, including one-off subsidies, the establishment of high-standard farming land and the protection of seeds.In addition to 20 billion yuan ($2.98 billion) worth of one-off subsidies distributed in March, the country pledged another 10 billion yuan from the central government budget to grain farmers in May to ease the impact of rising prices of farming supplies and spark farmers' motivation, according to the MOF.The authorities also raised the national minimum purchase price of wheat to 115 yuan per 50 kilograms, up 2 yuan year-on-year, according to data from the National Food and Strategic Reserves Administration.The state-owned grain enterprise Sinograin is preparing to purchase harvested new grain, making ready warehouses with a capacity for more than 40 million tons of grain. The company had purchased 110,000 tons of wheat by Friday, with average prices of 3,000-3,100 yuan per ton (150-155 yuan per 50 kilograms), playing an active role in safeguarding the interests of farmers while boosting market purchases.

Graphic: Global Times With strong support from governments and farmers' soaring enthusiasm due to increasing grain prices, a good harvest is expected this year, Li said. The difficulties caused by the epidemic, such as delivery of agricultural materials, have been solved and did not have much effect to the overall summer grain production.The bumper harvest comes amid soaring international wheat prices, as the Russia-Ukraine conflict has severely affected grain trade. According to a new report released by the UN Food and Agriculture Organization, the global wheat price rose 56.2 percent year-on-year in May, and it was only 11 percent below the record high reached in March 2008.Against the backdrop of skyrocketing inflation and the turbulent geopolitical situation, grain prices will remain high in the international market, experts said.""But it won't have much of an impact on domestic grain supplies, given relatively sufficient stockpiles and a good performance in terms of domestic production,"" Jiao said.In the second half of the year, plans for extreme weather and pests need to be prepared in advance to ensure year-round food production, he said.",SOURCE,ECONOMY,"Aerial photo taken on June 2, 2022 shows harvesters reaping wheat in the field in Tancheng County of Linyi City, east China's Shandong Province.

436,"US should curb inflation with caution, avoid exporting risks to global economy",Wang Yi,2022-06-13,"Sliced meats are displayed at Eataly NYC Downtown in New York, the US, on March 10, 2022. Photo: XinhuaThe US inflation problem worsened in May as widely forecasted. US consumer inflation hit a 40-year high at 8.6 percent in the 12 months through May, with gasoline marking a record high and the cost of food soaring, US Labor Department data showed. US President Joe Biden admitted the inflation could last ""for a while.""Speaking at a Democratic fundraising event on Friday, Joe Biden said this inflation is ""going to come down gradually,"" but the politically sensitive price pressures are not expected to alleviate automatically unless his administration can roll out right policy set to bring prices down.The elevated prices on daily necessities have been worsening domestic economic woes that trigger grievance among US ordinary consumers. The University of Michigan's consumer confidence index, released on Friday, fell to 50.2 in June from 58.7 in prior month, the lowest since 1980. If the Joe Biden administration could not take effective measures to curb the rising prices, the Democratic Party risks to lose its domination of Congress in the November midterm elections, political analysts warned.This time, Joe Biden is once again trying to shift the blame to other factors, including the Russia-Ukraine conflict, for high food and energy prices. Yet, it seems like a tactic that will unlikely work, as Republicans are trying to make sure voters do not forget inflation has been rising in the country for six months, well before the Russia-Ukraine conflict.In the global economic landscape, the impacts of the soaring inflation in the US have also become a major risk. In order to curb inflation, the US Federal Reserve (Fed) in May raised the interest rate by 50 basis points. Recently, the Fed sent signals that it will take similar actions in June and July. As the US is expected to move faster on tightening policies, an increasing number of economists believe that the risks for the US to be stuck in recession are rising. The recession will hit in the first half of 2023, a survey by CNBC CFO showed last week.The Fed has been slow to act in the early stage. Now, in order to curb inflation risks, it has to take fast tightening actions. This drastic policy shift has not only increased the risk of a recession in the US, but also caused negative spillover effects that impacted global financial markets and exacerbated stress in emerging markets.In the past, an important reason for the long-term low inflation in the US was that in the context of globalization, emerging markets continued to export commodities at lower price levels. Today, the US pursues unilateralism, arbitrarily ""cutting off supply"" and ""decoupling,"" seriously undermining the global supply chain and dragging the global economic growth.While US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen admitted that some China tariff cuts may help the US to ease the ""unacceptable"" inflation, US Trade Representative Katherine Tai on Monday said that fighting inflation is a more complicated issue than can be addressed with a ""singular focus"" on China tariffs. As a matter of fact, US tariffs on China have cost US companies more than $1.7 trillion and added $1,300 a year to US household spending. It is plain for all to see it is a simply right choice for the US to take if it removes its geopolitical calculations away.A report from the World Bank on June 7 warned that the Russia-Ukraine conflict, supply chain chokeholds, and dizzying rises in energy and food prices are exacting a growing toll on economies all along the income ladder. These problems are ""hammering growth,"" David Malpass, the bank's president, warned.Bloomberg in March quoted former US Treasury Secretary, Lawrence Summers, as warning that the US is suffering from the ""least responsible"" macroeconomic policy in 40 years. The US should be wary of the measures it takes to ease the worsening inflation and avoid further spillover impacts to cause more impacts on global economy.The author is an editor with the Global Times. bizopinion@globaltimes.com.cn",SOURCE,ECONOMY,Picture description not found,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'Eataly': ('ORG', 1), 'Xinhua': ('ORG', 1), 'US Labor Department': ('ORG', 1), 'University of Michigan': ('ORG', 1), 'Democratic Party': ('ORG', 1), 'Congress': ('ORG', 1), 'US Federal Reserve': ('ORG', 1), 'Fed': ('ORG', 3), 'NYC Downtown': ('LOC', 1), 'New York': ('LOC', 1), 'US': ('LOC', 8), 'Russia': ('LOC', 2), 'Ukraine': ('LOC', 2), 'USNBC CF': ('LOC', 1), 'Joe Biden': ('PER', 4), 'Democratic': ('MISC', 1), 'Republicans': ('MISC', 1)}"
437,Some Chinese cities on trial to shorten quarantine period to 7+7days for international arrivals at entry points,Fan Anqi and Zhang Changyue,2022-06-13," At least three cities in China, namely Beijing, Nanjing, and Wuhan, appeared to have shortened quarantine time by three to seven days for international arrivals on trial basis, which now only requires seven days of centralized quarantine and another seven days of home quarantine, the Global Times has learned on Sunday. When the Global Times reached Beijing's COVID-19 prevention hotline on Sunday, it was informed that starting from May 15, Beijing has reduced again the centralized quarantine time from 10 days to seven. Nucleic acid tests and antigen tests must be taken as required during the quarantine period. The capital city has already shortened the quarantine time for international arrivals. At a press conference on May 4, spokesperson of the Beijing Municipal Government Xu Hejian said that given the characteristics of the short incubation period and mild clinical symptoms of the Omicron variant, an adjustment to the measures have already been made  when people entering the country via Beijing were required to undergo a 10-day quarantine instead of the previous 14 days at designated facilities and another 7-day quarantine at home. If they did not have a fixed domicile in Beijing, then they would have continued the quarantine at the designated facilities for another four days.City hotline of Nanjing in China's Jiangsu Province also confirmed such an adjustment to the Global Times. It said that four nucleic acid tests during the 7-day centralized quarantine and another three during the 7-day home quarantine will be given, while reminding that the policy will be updated every now and then based on the epidemic's situation and the current adjustment is only in a trial phase that started from Friday and will last till June 17. Wuhan of Central China's Hubei Province, which previously required international arrivals to quarantine for 21 days in total, has cut quarantine time by a whole week in the latest policy adjustment. After seven days of centralized quarantine, people are allowed to be transferred to their own homes in or outside Wuhan in a closed-loop to carry out the other seven days of quarantine, the city hotline told the Global Times.Other landing ports in China, including Guangzhou, Xiamen, Chengdu, Ji'nan and Dalian will keep implementing the 14+7 or 10+7 quarantine measures. Macao Special Administrative Region announced in a government notice on Saturday that, given the fact that the Omicron variant has a relatively short incubation period and could be detected normally within the first seven days after contact, Macao has decided to take the experiences from the China mainland and will adjust its quarantine measures from 14 days of centralized quarantine to 10 days starting from Wednesday, coupled with another seven days of self-health monitoring. Additionally, Macao's Chief Executive Ho Iat-seng recently announced that four cities in the mainland are carrying out evaluation works for the 7+7 trial run, and Macao will try to follow suit and implement similar measures as well,media reported.",CHINA,SOCIETY,"Chinese citizens evacuated from Ukraine go through entry procedures at the Hangzhou Xiaoshan International Airport in Hangzhou, east China's Zhejiang Province, March 5, 2022.

438,"Japan continues to address 'concerns' over China during defense ministers' meeting, attempting to take advantage from regional conflicts",Xu Yelu,2022-06-13,"File Photo: VCGFollowing Japan Prime Minister Fumio Kishida and Defense Minister Nobuo Kishi's speeches at the 19th Shangri-La Dialogue on Friday, Kishi continued to express Japan's so-called ""concerns"" during his meeting with China's State Councilor and Defense Minister Wei Fenghe on Sunday. Experts said that it was not surprising for Kishi, a long-time China-bashing politician to bring these issues up in the dialogue. Still experts said this first face-to-face meeting between both defense ministers in over two years signaled some goodwill from both sides.China wants to strengthen bilateral cooperation and build a relationship based on consensus between the two governments, China's State Councilor and Defense Minister Wei Fenghe said in the meeting, Japan media outlet the Japan Times reported.After being canceled for two years due to COVID-19 pandemic, the IISS 19th Shangri-La Dialogue took place in Singapore from Friday to Sunday.The China-Japan defense ministers' dialogue on Sunday drew wide attention from the international community, as Japan is the one that closely follows the US in using the current Russia-Ukraine crisis to hype the China mainland's ""threat"" to the island of Taiwan. The Taiwan question and China Sea issue were covered during the meeting, according to Reuters. Kishi told Wei that ""Many concerns exist between Japan and China, including various security issues,"" the report said.Analysts believed that it shows that Japan wants to take advantage of the deep involvement and military presence of the US in the China Sea, as well as some ASEAN members who have disputes with China over maritime features, to make profits and form the so-called free and open Indo-Pacific promoted by Japan.On Friday, Japan Prime Minister Fumio Kishida used the Russia-Ukraine conflict as an example to oppose ""unilateral changes"" to the status quo by force and unveil a plan to raise Japan's defense budget. ""There is no such thing as a change of the status quo in the island of Taiwan influencing Japan's security because peaceful development and peaceful reunification across the Taiwan Straits are in essence more beneficial to China-Japan relations and the stable international situation in East Asia,"" Liu Jiangyong, vice dean of the Institute of Modern International Relations at Tsinghua University, told the Global Times on Sunday.He noted that it is obvious that Japan's policy toward China has undergone a significant regression since the normalization of diplomatic relations 50 years ago. ""In the future, Japan will use the Taiwan question or the so-called China Sea issue to further build up its military and weave a strategic encircling net to contain China in the international arena. I believe China should remain on high alert,"" Liu said.For issues on which the two sides have different positions, open dialogue is actually the most appropriate choice, Liu said. At the same time, China and Japan can also consider appropriate cooperation in non-traditional security areas such as climate change and combating maritime smuggling and drug trafficking.Wang Guangtao, an associate research fellow at the Center for Japan Studies of the Shanghai-based Fudan University, also noted this defense meeting is constructive while condemning Japan's recent provocations on the Taiwan question.""There are some inherent structural issues between China and Japan, such as historical issues and the Diaoyu Islands issue, but these issues are between China and Japan. However, the Taiwan question and the China Sea issue are all hyped by Japan to contain China by taking itself as a concerned country, which is very detrimental to the improvement of China-Japan relations,"" Wang noted.This year marks the 50th anniversary of the normalization of China-Japan relations, which is a very important juncture. It is of great significance to break through the difficulties and have a face-to-face dialogue amid the epidemic, which is also in line with the wishes of the people of China and Japan, experts said.",CHINA,DIPLOMACY,Picture description not found,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'VCG': ('ORG', 1), 'Council': ('ORG', 1), 'Japan Times': ('ORG', 2), 'Reuters': ('ORG', 1), 'Institute': ('ORG', 1), 'Japan': ('LOC', 12), 'China': ('LOC', 9), 'Singapore': ('LOC', 1), 'US': ('LOC', 2), 'Ukraine': ('LOC', 2), 'Taiwan': ('LOC', 3), 'China Sea': ('LOC', 11), '- Pacific': ('LOC', 1), 'Taiwan Straits': ('LOC', 4), 'East Asia': ('LOC', 1), 'Fumio Kishida': ('PER', 2), 'Nobuo Kishi': ('PER', 4), 'Wei Fenghe': ('PER', 3), '19th Shangri - La Dialogue': ('MISC', 1), 'COVID - 19': ('MISC', 1), 'IISS 19th Shangri - La Dialogue': ('MISC', 1), 'Russia': ('MISC', 2), 'ASEAN': ('MISC', 1), 'Indo': ('MISC', 1), 'Jiang': ('MISC', 1)}"
439,Zelensky’s Taiwan remarks ‘used by some forces to create tension between China and Ukraine’: Chinese FM,Global Times,2022-06-13,"In response to Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky's remarks while answering a question over the Taiwan question at the Shangri-La Dialogue, China Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said on Monday that it has been used by some forces to create tensions between China and Ukraine, reiterating that the Taiwan question, which is China's internal affair, is fundamentally different from the Ukraine issue. During a video call with Volodymyr Zelensky at the Shangri-La Dialogue, a reporter with the US Post asked what advice he had regarding China's Taiwan, ""which is facing a similar (although not yet violent) campaign of economic and military coercion from its neighbor, China."" Volodymyr Zelensky said the Ukraine example shows that once violence breaks out, the human costs are staggering, so every effort must be made to find a diplomatic solution to avoid outright conflict, if possible. But at the same time, he said, the international community must intervene before tensions spill over into violence to ensure a smaller country can stand up to an aggressor.It is worth noticing that while the Ukraine President did not mentioned the island of Taiwan in his remarks, the US Post titled the article ""Volodymyr Zelensky calls for international support for Taiwan before China attacks.""At Monday's press conference, Wang noted that Volodymyr Zelensky's remarks, as some media pointed out, have been used by some forces to create tensions between China and Ukraine. The spokesperson reiterated that the Taiwan question, which is purely China's internal affair, is fundamentally different from the Ukraine issue, and it does not allow any foreign forces to intervene. Any attempts to separate Taiwan with the mainland will be faced with resolute actions, Wang stressed. The China delegation attending the Shangri-La Dialogue summit in Singapore has also become the target of rumors again, when two West research fellows tweeted on Saturday that the China delegation walked out of the meeting room when Volodymyr Zelensky started his speech via video link. The allegation was soon clarified by a former US defense official who pointed out that it was the Vietnamese delegation who left the room and also dismissed as a rumor by a China attendee in the same meeting on Saturday.Also at the Shangri-La Dialogue, China State Councilor and Defense Minister General Wei Fenghe said the China armed forces will fight to the very end if anyone dares to split Taiwan from China, delivering a tone that some analysts believed to be ""the strongest warning"" China has sent to the US, as US has frequently used the Taiwan question to provoke China and encourage separatist authorities on the island to worsen the region's security situation.Global Times",CHINA,DIPLOMACY,"Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky (on screen) addresses participants at the Shangri-La Dialogue summit virtually via a video link in Singapore on June 11, 2022.

440,Pathetic Washington Post fakes support to embolden Taiwan secessionists,Global Times,2022-06-13,"A recent media drama surrounding Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky and the Taiwan question at the Shangri-La Dialogue once again showed how low some US media outlets like the US Post can be in order to spin anti-China public opinion. After Volodymyr Zelensky's video address at the event on Saturday, US Post columnist Josh Rogin took the chance to raise a misleading question for the Ukraine president: ""How do you recommend that Taiwan stand strong as China seeks to impose its control over a free people, by force if necessary?"" It is no surprise Rogin asked such a question, as the ""Ukraine today, Taiwan tomorrow"" comparison has recently been hyped by West media. Volodymyr Zelensky gave a seemingly vague answer. He did not mention ""China"" or ""Taiwan"" once in his reply, only emphasizing the importance of taking the ""diplomatic way"" preemptively before a war starts.It is a cautious answer to the Taiwan question. In terms of selecting the words, Volodymyr Zelensky was much more prudent than many US politicians. Volodymyr Zelensky understands the issue concerns China's core interest and didn't fall for the trap set by Rogin.But Rogin still published an article with the headline ""Volodymyr Zelensky calls for international support for Taiwan before China attacks"" in the US Post. As of press time, this patently false headline was still on the website of the newspaper.Rogin is apparently very familiar with using disinformation to create a sensation. He tweeted four times in a row about the article and retweeted it three times.  According to Lü Xiang, a research fellow at the China Academy of Social Sciences, Volodymyr Zelensky, despite his lack of full knowledge of the Taiwan question, has managed to not fall into Rogin's trap. ""In contrast to Rogin's understanding, Volodymyr Zelensky is tactfully criticizing the US and the West for constantly engaging in provocations before the war instead of giving Ukraine any substantial assistance,"" said Lü.With ill intentions, some US media outlets have taken any opportunity to link the discussion of the Ukraine crisis to the Taiwan question. They want to fake an impression that some other nations share a similar position with US on the Taiwan question. Only in this way can they justify the US' upgraded provocative actions toward the China mainland over the Taiwan question - and, therefore, continue with their reckless moves.The US propaganda machines are trying to make Ukraine a US accomplice on the Taiwan question. But most countries know that the Ukraine crisis is different from the Taiwan question. One prominent difference is that Ukraine is a recognized independent sovereign state, regardless of its historical disputes with Russia, while Taiwan is not. Taiwan authorities can only be considered a separated regime in the unfinished China civil war, Lü explained.While looking for ""supporters"" on the Taiwan question, some West media are attempting to sow discord between Beijing and Kiev as well. They would probably like to see China heavily criticize Volodymyr Zelensky after his remarks so that Ukraine would become completely on the opposite side of China.Except for a few Taiwan media, Volodymyr Zelensky's comment on the Ukraine-Taiwan comparison hasn't been extensively reported by global media. Such a gimmick of these media is not new to the world. And the smart-alecky US propaganda machines cannot manipulate China-Ukraine ties. At the end of the day, these lie-spreaders serving the political interests of the White House will only be mocked and despised by even more people.",OPINION,OBSERVER,"Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky (on screen) addresses participants at the Shangri-La Dialogue summit virtually via a video link in Singapore on June 11, 2022.

441,China’s dynamic zero-COVID policy creates a strong fortress for world against virus: Japanese professor,Xing Xiaojing,2022-06-13,"Editor's Note:China's big metropolises including Beijing and Shanghai are returning to a normal pace of life and production and the epidemic is also well controlled in other places around China, which has shown the effectiveness of China's dynamic zero-COVID-19 policy. However, for some time, certain countries have consistently smeared and bad-mouthed the dynamic zero-COVID-19 policy. Tomisaka Satoshi (Tomisaka), a Professor at the Institute of World Studies at Takushoku University penned an article, stressing that the dynamic zero-COVID-19 policy is, so far, the only choice for China when the toxicity of the Omicron variant has not been significantly weakened. The Global Times reporter Xing Xiaojing (Global Times) talked with Tomisaka in an exclusive interview on the choices of anti-pandemic measures.

Tomisaka Satoshi, a Professor at the Institute of World Studies at Takushoku University Photo: Courtesy of TomisakaGT: Beijing, Shanghai and other places across China are gradually returning to normal production and pace of life, which once again proves the efficiency of China's dynamic zero-COVID-19 approach. In this context, why do you think it is necessary for China to insist on the dynamic zero-COVID-19 policy?Tomisaka: I think it is necessary to stick to the dynamic zero-COVID-19 policy until we fully understand whether the novel coronavirus disease can be completely ignored. The necessity of adhering to the dynamic zero-COVID-19 policy is based on the comprehensive consideration of China's medical system and the reality of China's national condition. Given China's large population and a shortage of medical resources, the spread of the novel coronavirus disease could cause a serious chain reaction. There are some gaps in China's healthcare system. The collapse of the rural healthcare system will inevitably lead to the collapse of the urban health system, which could lead to a vicious cycle. That is, in rural areas where the epidemic spreads, there is an increased risk that a new mutant strain emerges, which will ultimately spread to cities. While cities will try every means necessary to contain it, it's still highly possible for a new mutant strain to emerge in the countryside. This will possibly happen over and over again. In addition, we must also consider how to maximize the protection of the elderly, children, and other vulnerable groups.In short, if China cannot ""prevent"" the novel coronavirus disease in the defensive stages, the subsequent huge pressure will be transferred to dealing with its spread. Before the danger of the virus infection is completely determined, China's dynamic zero-COVID-19 approach is a very necessary measure, and it is also the most suitable way for China to proceed. Moreover, from the perspective of preventing the emergence of new mutant strains, China's dynamic zero-COVID-19 policy has gone beyond the domestic epidemic prevention and control, but has also played the role of building a strong fortress for the world against the virus.

Residents and couriers entering a compound scan a health code on May 30 in Beijing. Photo: Li Hao/GTGT: In Japan and the West, some people questioned and criticized China's dynamic zero-COVID-19 policy. What's your take on it?Tomisaka: The dynamic zero-COVID-19 policy does not mean ""zero infection,"" as some Japan and West media outlets have equated the two. It is regrettable that they are so quick to criticize and question the dynamic zero-COVID-19 policy without even properly understanding what it is. his phenomenon is not simply a misunderstanding or misrepresentation. I think it can be roughly divided into two reasons. First, from the very beginning, they held a negative attitude toward China's anti-epidemic measures and were unwilling to admit that China's anti-epidemic policy was effective, insisting that the dynamic zero-COVID-19 policy had problems and flaws. Second, judging from the figures, they believe that China is ""over-quarantined."" The number of new cases in China is relatively small by the standards of Japan and West countries, so they question whether China's dynamic zero-COVID-19 policy is too much and whether the sacrifice in the economic terms is too great.Japan and the West community cannot understand China's shortage of medical resources, ignoring the rationality of prevention and control measures. At the same time, the economic recovery cannot immediately yield obvious results and this is a reason for their criticism and skepticism.Global Times: Can the global response to COVID-19 be roughly divided into ""coexistence"" and ""zeroing""? Do the two have to be contradictory?Tomisaka: It can be divided in this way. ""Coexistence"" is a loose response method that lasts for a long time; ""zeroing"" is a vigorous way to control the epidemic in a short period of time. In my opinion, ""coexistence"" and ""zeroing"" are neither right nor wrong, but rather whether they are suitable or not. It is up to each country to decide on its own based on actual national conditions. Take Japan as an example. It is very difficult to adopt the dynamic zero-COVID-19 policy in Japan as the administrative procedures are too cumbersome, and it is difficult to recruit volunteers. Japan also has no idea how to implement lockdown and can only choose ""coexistence."" Since choosing ""coexistence,"" it can be felt that the Japan people's tolerance for the novel coronavirus disease has increased, and the Japan government does not seem to be prepared to take other anti-epidemic measures. The current daily number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Japan remains thousands, which is not a problem in Japan, but there are also predictions that Japan may see a potential new wave in autumn.I don't think Japan has any reason to criticize China's dynamic zero-COVID-19 policy. It is up to each country to make a choice between ""coexistence"" and ""zeroing"" based on its own national conditions. The dynamic zero-COVID-19 policy is certainly not perfect, and the difficulties of detecting asymptomatic infections early can make it seem passive at times. But that is because the characteristics of the Omicron strain itself, therefore it cannot be regarded as simply a policy issue. As far as the current situation is concerned, until the novel coronavirus disease has been comprehensively studied, the dynamic zero-COVID-19 policy is China's only option, and there is no more effective method.Global Times: Lockdown and control measures under the ""dynamic zero-COVID-19"" policy would affect the economy to a certain extent. Certain people in Japan and some West countries have been hyping ""China economic collapse theory."" What do you think of this?Tomisaka: I don't know why they came to such an extreme conclusion. It is difficult to assess the economic impact of the current round of the epidemic. It is not appropriate to try to draw a conclusion now.China's economic foundation is very solid. During the outbreak in 2020, China was also the only major country to achieve positive economic growth. The ""dynamic zero-COVID-19"" policy ""sacrificed"" the May Day golden week holiday, which will be reflected in May's economic data. At present, the epidemic situation in various parts of China has been basically contained, and this part of the loss is expected to be recovered during the summer and long National Day holidays in October, and people's enthusiasm to travel may be even higher.The lockdown and control measures are bound to affect the economy, but views such as China's economic ""collapse"" and the country ""falling into the abyss"" are doubtful. There is a lot of talk about the decline of China's real estate industry. In fact, long before the epidemic, China realized the limitations of an economy that relies on the real estate market, and tried to get rid of an economic model that relies too heavily on it. China has long been intending to adjust several industries including real estate, but the pace of adjustment has slowed down due to the epidemic, which has led to unnecessary concerns from the outside world.China's economic structure and foundation have not changed due to the epidemic, especially in terms of trade. China plays a pivotal role in the world and should be back on track soon. Returning to strong levels of consumer expenditure may take some time - not just in China, but also around the world as it faces this problem. After this epidemic, whether consumers will return to a pre-pandemic level of spending is still too early to draw conclusions. As the growth engine of the world economy, China's dominant position in the global economy is relatively outstanding. Especially in the context of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, the world has placed higher expectations on a stable China.We should pay more attention to the trajectory of China's economy in the ""post-epidemic era"" - its technological power. According to data released by the National Bureau of Statistics of China, investment in high-tech manufacturing increased by 32.7 percent in the first quarter, and the high-value-added high-tech and digital fields continued to grow steadily despite the headwinds of the epidemic.The impact of the lockdown and control measures is only temporary, and China's economy can be back on track. Moreover, China's policies such as providing subsidies for small, medium, and micro enterprises and encouraging the cultivation of scientific and technological talent can also fundamentally support the development of China's economy, which will have impacts in the future.Global Times: How can a balance between ""dynamic zero-COVID-19"" policy and ""boosting the economy"" be achieved?Tomisaka: From the experiences gained from Wuhan and Shanghai, even if China is locked down, a return to normal daily life can be guaranteed.  During the lockdown, people are often eager to know when they could return to a normal pace of daily life. If the consensus is reached regarding the duration, both production and life can be rescheduled within a certain time frame.For example, if it can be predicted that there may be two months in a year during which the pace of production and life will slow down, early assessment and preparation will be made and it will be easier to achieve a balance between ""dynamic zero-COVID-19"" and an ""economic recovery,"" which could also be a way to co-exist with the virus.Global Times：China has taken a series of concrete measures including normalizing free nucleic acid tests to resume a normal pace of life and production. Can this be considered as preparations for reopening? Tomisaka: Reopening is just a matter of time. This is an important issue related to the global supply chain. As Shanghai is an important import and export base, the inability to circulate materials due to the lockdown has drawn dissatisfaction from some countries.China plays an important role on the world stage, which is hard to change. In the early days of the outbreak in Wuhan, I feared of not being able to buy masks, disinfectant, and other supplies in Japan. At that time, the Japan government introduced subsidies, hoping to move the production of these products to Japan but this never happened. China's strongholds, which have been well established for many years, will not change just because of a policy issued by the Japan government. Therefore, this also highlights the huge role played by China and also makes certain foreign forces target China during the lockdown period. Before formally ""reopening,"" how to build a communication channel with foreign countries to form a ""win-win"" reality will be a new topic that China will need to solve.As with the normalization of free nucleic acid tests, China conducts about 57 million nucleic acid tests on a daily basis. This huge number shows China's strength. In epidemic prevention and control, advanced technologies such as instant delivery by drone and accurate screening with big data are refreshing. It is interesting to see what other technological innovations China will employ in the process of gradually exploring the way of opening its border. Global Times: Under what circumstances could China explore the way to gradually open its border?Tomisaka: Early detection of asymptomatic infections through testing and other means is an important prerequisite. In addition, ""reopening"" also depends on how the novel coronavirus disease mutates. If it can be determined that the harm caused by virus transmission is very low, then there will be no need to adhere to the dynamic zero-COVID-19 policy. On the other hand, if the mutated strain is extremely dangerous, albeit highly unlikely, then only the dynamic zero-COVID-19 policy could contain it. Although Japan has already lifted the ban, some predict that the virus could further spread this autumn.Whether ""opening"" is equivalent to ""letting the virus spread,"" and how we can ""coexist"" with the virus, there are many variables to be considered in these issues. So I think the process of exploring the way of ""reopening"" must approached carefully.Global Times: How do you evaluate China's dynamic zero-COVID-19 policy?Tomisaka: I hope that Japan and West countries can realize that if China does not respond to the novel coronavirus disease and blindly chooses to ""lie flat and coexist,"" the consequences will be very serious, let alone the economic activity. I want to stress once again that the dynamic zero-COVID-19 policy is what China must do and the only option it has. Over the past period, the number of COVID-19 patients in China has been effectively controlled, which clearly demonstrates the success of the dynamic zero-COVID-19 policy. We need to wait until the end of the year to see how the economy recovers to judge whether it is a ""big success.""",IN-DEPTH,IN-DEPTH,Residents line up for a nucleic acid test on May 30 in Beijing.

442,Sherman’s visit tanks and fails to raise hope of revitalizing Philippine-US ties,Herman Tiu Laurel,2022-06-12,"A much-publicized visit of the US Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman to Asia is underway as part of the ongoing series of US Indo-Pacific Strategy to keep its presence in the region alive after the Donald Trump era withdrawal to focus on ""US First"" which faltered.Joe Biden on his second year as president of the US is attempting to live up to his promise of keeping the ""US at the head of the table"" of world affairs, traveling to Asia too in May this year in a trip marked by his stumbling over ""military defense"" of Taiwan island he had to walk back for days and days after.Arriving in Manila on June 9, Sherman met with the expected Asia and Filipino etiquette and politesse, especially from affable president-elect Ferdinand ""Bongbong"" Romualdez Marcos Jr, or BBM for short. Sherman's plate had the usual platitudes: ""free and open Indo-Pacific,"" human rights, ""freedom of navigation,"" the ""rules-based order,"" the Visiting Forces Agreement and the like. The Sherman visit added a new spice. The deputy secretary of state announced that president-elect BBM would be ""welcome"" to the US given his diplomatic immunity as a head of state. This simply recalls that Sherman's meeting with BBM marked a complete reversal  of the 1986 ""regime change"" of the US against the elder Marcos. However, Sherman's visit clearly tanked and failed to raise hope of revitalizing Philippine-US relations. The realities just won't allow it: A tanking US economy and society wracked by rising social violence, racism and hyper-inflation; impending defeat in the Ukraine proxy war; the inevitable political debacle of Democrats in the upcoming midterms will all stand to destabilize US policy once more.The day after Sherman's visit, Ferdinand E. Marcos showed whom he and the Philippines consider the real bosom mate of the country. In an extravaganza of the Association for Philippines-China Understanding (APCU) the president-elect declared China to be the Philippines' ""strongest partner"" and that no ""greater champion"" is there for China than his mother former First Lady Imelda Marcos, who is also an awardee.The APCU conducts an annual award for 10 top individuals promoting understanding between the peoples of China and the Philippines. It has become a bigger-and-bigger event after its first year. Marcos' gracing of the event made it a national event of the year and the words for China as the ""strongest partner"" reverberate throughout the land.While the president-elect's recent declaration is the latest and most visible expression of the Philippines' appreciation of China, there is another although silent manifestation of the popular rise of a China-friendly reception by the Filipino people. The first is an opinion poll in June 2021 by PuBLICUS Asia showing 53 percent of Filipinos are ""open to China as friend or potential ally.""Another private survey group, OCTA research affiliated with the University of the Philippines which had proven very accurate and reliable tracking and advising the public on COVID-19 pandemic levels, had also reported through an embargoed survey to a closed group I attended in May that there has been a ""dramatic positive turnaround"" in the Filipinos' perception of China.In the PuBLICUS Asia survey the reason for turnaround in perception was the 56-million doses of COVID-19 donated and delivered by China in 2021, in the OCTA research the reason cited was the opening of the spectacular Binondo-Intramuros Bridge easing traffic at the heart the key metropolis of the country. The endless stream of wins for the Philippines in the ""win-win"" relationship spells the difference.The US ""China threat"" ruse does not work anymore. The Philippines and China are and will continue to be the most robust friends as they have been for a millennium past. Sherman's 10-day tour also includes trips to the Laos and Vietnam. China is too tied to the good economic future of these ASEAN countries to take these US overtures seriously. At the same time the US' dismal economic performance and false promises, the disastrous Ukraine proxy war and calamitous ""sanctions war"" all have severely undermined the credibility of the US. In the end little will come out of this latest PR tour of the US in the region although they always ratchet up tension and propaganda on such occasions.The author is the founder of Philippine-BRICS Strategic Studies. opinion@globaltimes.com.cn",OPINION,VIEWPOINT,Wendy Sherman photo:CFP,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'US': ('LOC', 8), 'Asia': ('LOC', 3), 'Taiwan': ('LOC', 1), 'Manila': ('LOC', 1), 'Indo': ('LOC', 1), 'Pacific': ('LOC', 1), 'Ukraine': ('LOC', 1), 'Philippinesosoza': ('LOC', 1), 'Philippines': ('LOC', 3), 'China': ('LOC', 4), 'Wendy Sherman': ('PER', 7), 'Donald Trump': ('PER', 1), 'Joe Biden': ('PER', 1), 'Ferdinand': ('PER', 2), 'Bongbong "" Romualdez Marcos Jr': ('PER', 4), 'US Indo - Pacific Strategy': ('MISC', 1), 'Filipino': ('MISC', 1), 'Visiting Forces Agreement': ('MISC', 1), 'Philippine': ('MISC', 1), 'Democrats': ('MISC', 1), 'US First': ('ORG', 2), 'BBM': ('ORG', 3), 'E': ('ORG', 1), 'Association': ('ORG', 1), 'APCU': ('ORG', 2)}"
443,Elections see left challenge to Macron,AFP,2022-06-12,"France began voting in the first round of parliamentary elections on Sunday, with a resurgent and newly unified left seeking to thwart President Emmanuel Macron's plans for reform.Elections for the 577 seats in the lower house National Assembly are a two-round process, with the shape of the new parliament becoming clear only after the second round on June COVID-19.The ballots provide a crucial coda to April's presidential election, when Macron won a second term and pledged a transformative new era after a first mandate dominated by protests, the coronavirus pandemic and the Russia-Ukraine crisis.Polls opened at 8 am (0600 GMT) in mainland France, after voters in overseas territories cast ballots earlier in the weekend.After a dismal performance in April, the France left has united in a coalition for what its leader Jean-Luc Melenchon dubs ""the third round"" of the presidential elections.Opinion polls show the president's centrist alliance, Ensemble (Together), and Melenchon's NUPES coalition of hard left, Socialists, Communists and Greens neck-and-neck in the popular vote.But France's constituency-based parliamentary system and the two-round election means that the seat breakdown will be another matter, and much will depend on turnout in the second round.The abstention rate is predicted to be well over 50 percent in the first round, in what would be a new record for elections already marked by feeble participation in recent years.If the president's alliance retains an overall majority, Macron will be able to carry on governing as before. Falling short could prompt messy bill-by-bill deals with right-wing parties in parliament or an unwanted cabinet reshuffle.A win by the left-wing alliance - seen as unlikely by analysts but not impossible - would be a disaster for Macron. It would raise the specter of a clunky ""cohabitation"" - where the prime minister and president hail from different factions - which has paralyzed France politics in the past.The most recent example was from 1997 to 2002 when right-wing president Jacques Chirac ruled in tandem with Socialist Lionel Jospin as premier.Socialist president Francois Mitterrand twice had to cohabit with right-wingers: with Chirac in a famously fractious ruling duo and then with Edouard Balladur.Melenchon, a former Marxist, has already made clear his ambition to become prime minister and stymie Macron's plan to raise the France retirement age, although the president would retain control over foreign policy.Stepping into the fray on Thursday, Macron acknowledged the stakes were high, warning France against choosing ""extremes"" that would add ""crisis to crisis.""""If the presidential election is crucial, the legislative election is decisive,"" he said in a statement.Agence France-Presse",WORLD,EUROPE,French President Emmanuel Macron,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'France': ('LOC', 5), 'Russia': ('LOC', 1), 'Ukraine': ('LOC', 1), 'Emmanuel Macron': ('PER', 4), 'Jean': ('PER', 1), 'Luc Melenchon': ('PER', 2), 'Jacques Chi': ('PER', 2), 'Lionel Jo': ('PER', 1), 'Francois Mirand': ('PER', 1), 'Edouard': ('PER', 1), 'Melcho': ('PER', 1), 'National AssemblyD': ('ORG', 1), 'Ensemble': ('ORG', 1), 'Together': ('ORG', 1), 'NUPES': ('ORG', 1), 'Communists': ('ORG', 1), 'Greens': ('ORG', 1), 'GM': ('MISC', 1), 'Socialist': ('MISC', 1)}"
444,Blocking RT demonstrates Western establishments’ fear and hypocrisy: RT editor-in-chief,Global Times,2022-06-12,"
Editor's Note: 

During the past decade, the world has increasingly witnessed the trend of ""the East is rising, and the West is declining"" in the spheres of economy, security and discourse power. The West countries, particularly the US, plagued by internal woes, have sought the old path of passing the buck and instigating turmoil elsewhere to ease their own pressure. China, representative of the emerging countries, is proposing the new solutions to global problems. By advocating win-win development, facilitating consultation and reconciliation, proposing a balanced and effective security mechanism, China is striving for building a community with a shared future for mankind.In the first of the series, Margarita Simonyan, editor-in-chief of RT, told Global Times reporter Xia Wenxin how voices from countries such as Russia and China have entered the scene and gained traction internationally, breaking the monopoly of the West media in global public opinion. 
Global Times: Russia Today (RT) is well known in China, and we all think that RT is quite ""combative"" (in a good way). Are you satisfied with RT's and personally, your work?
Simonyan: I am very proud of the work that RT has accomplished over the last 17 years. We have been broadcasting in over 100 countries, becoming the first TV news channel in the world to hit 10 billion views on YouTube. In March 2022, before we were unceremoniously removed from a number of digital platforms, we hit a record 200+ million monthly visits to our websites, coupled with a regular weekly TV audience of 100 million viewers globally - ahead of much of our competition. We did all this by covering stories that the mainstream media was afraid to touch or show the full picture. We believe that this very success is what led to a campaign to shut down RT and restrict access to our services.
Global Times: Just like RT, many China media also face restrictions in the US. How do you feel about the rise of non-West English-language media outlets, such as RT and the Global Times? How much of a challenge do their voices pose to the traditional media in the US and the West?
Simonyan: When we started RT, we genuinely expected to be accepted by the greater media community. Indeed, for decades we had been taught that diversity of voices was paramount to a well-informed society and to the greater global understanding, and we welcomed other, foreign voices in turn in Russia. But the supposed media freedom endlessly heralded by the West establishments has turned out to be entirely false. The minute that our voice and that of others outside this narrow echo-chamber, whether they are from China, Latin US or the Middle East, entered the scene and gained traction internationally including in the US and EU, it was those who used to lecture US on media freedom that launched campaigns to shut US down and shut US out of the public discourse.
Global Times: Based on RT's experience, how do you get your voice out to countries unfriendly to Russia?
Simonyan: The landscape is shifting on an almost daily basis. We continue to use all legal means at our disposal to bring RT's voice to audiences that desire and need it across the world. In fact, it is the desire for our output from such audiences that provides the impetus for US to keep seeking new platforms and challenge the restrictions put on US.
Global Times: RT now is being blocked by the US and the West in general. What kind of truth can be seen from RT's blockage? To what extent has this affected RT and what is your plan?
Simonyan: The demand for someone to complete the picture of news and not just repeat the same views and opinions as mainstream West media is great, and will remain so, all around the world. When the West media's political establishments seek to suppress an outlet like RT, they are ignoring the demand for diversity from their own public, and are only showing viewers a reality that does not reflect even their own backyards, let alone the bigger, balanced global picture. It's precisely this narrow thinking that has led to audiences, particularly in the West world, to increasingly lose trust in their own news media.
It is overtly clear that RT's blocking, without any just cause or legitimate legal grounds, serves to demonstrate the level of fear that exists among West establishments and their respective media over something so simple as telling the truth, as well as the hypocrisy of the values they have long preached to the rest of the world. Our plan is to keep reporting from the frontlines, and to keep showing what is going on in the world.

Global Times: On the military conflict between Russia and Ukraine, is Russia media coverage of it being able to sufficiently suppress West propaganda in Russia? Has West media stopped infiltrating Russia society since the war broke out?
Simonyan: It is not RT's goal to shut out any kind of voice or information, as long as it is truthful and facts-based. This aligns directly with the primary mission of our own journalists: to bring forth the truth of what is going on in Ukraine, in Russia, in the world. That's why our fearless reporters have been on the frontlines of the special operation in Ukraine for the last three months - and in the DNR and LNR for the past eight years of conflict there - showing the reality of what is going on each and every day. Our mission is to do our job as journalists, and we receive daily confirmation from people inside and outside of Russia that we do it well, and our audiences thank US for it.Global Times: Last June, you commented that a comparison between China social networks and YouTube is a comparison between a fighter jet and a rusty bicycle. Such a statement was hotly discussed in China. Can you elaborate on why you made such a comparison?
Simonyan: China has demonstrated that it is absolutely possible to create its own independent digital, technological and media ecosystems, which are not just on par but often superior to their West counterparts. We have seen over the last years that a huge part, if not the majority, of the world operates in a media space controlled - essentially monopolized - by a handful of US digital platforms. Behind these platforms, a handful of executives, subject to a single government's control, dictate what kind of information the entire world has access to - this is a travesty. In that regard, China has defied these West monopolies and managed to safeguard its own digital space, something that is essential to national sovereignty and security of any country, by generating tools like Weibo, WeChat, TikTok, among others, that are now known all around the world.
Global Times: As far as we know, two of your children are learning China because ""China is one of the most important countries in the world now and will become stronger in the future,"" as you explained. In your opinion, how has China changed in recent decades, and especially in the last decade?
Simonyan: It is undeniable that China has been incredibly successful in securing its own sovereignty and autonomy through significant and strategic investment not just in economic and defense spheres, but in the information and technological space. By deliberately developing those spaces, China has demonstrated a deep understanding of just how essential they are for both the national welfare and geopolitical standing - it has ensured its future on its own terms and largely free from foreign dependence and interference. There are definitely lessons that we can pick up from the China experience.
Global Times: What advice would you give to your China media counterparts who also target West audiences?Simonyan: China deservedly has its own point of view and story that it wants and needs to show the world. In our experience there is, and always will be, an audience for that. There is a real demand around the world for diversity of viewpoints, and my best advice is not to be put off by the illegitimate actions of a handful of West governments seeking to suppress alternative views - in the face of any such challenge China can continue to tell its own story.",OPINION,VIEWPOINT,Photo: VCG,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'East': ('LOC', 1), 'US': ('LOC', 3), 'China': ('LOC', 5), 'Russia': ('LOC', 3), 'West': ('MISC', 4), 'West English': ('MISC', 5), 'Margarita Simonyan': ('PER', 2), 'Xia Wenxin': ('PER', 1), 'Simon': ('PER', 1), 'RT': ('ORG', 6), 'Global Times': ('ORG', 5), 'Today': ('ORG', 1)}"
445,"US views on Asia-Pacific security selfish, hegemonic and ultimately untenable",Song Zhongping,2022-06-12,"After their meeting on Friday, US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin and China State Councilor and Defense Minister Wei Fenghe respectively delivered a speech about the defense strategy of each country over the weekend at the 19th Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore. Their remarks demonstrate the utterly different approaches of the world's two great powers in dealing with regional security and global order issues.Whether in its national or international security concept, the primary consideration of US is about the golden rule of ""US First"" - in other words, US's core interest concerns how to maintain its global hegemony. In contrast, China's core interests lie in not only safeguarding its own sovereignty, security and development, but also maintaining regional and global peace and stability. Therefore, China is shaping international security with the idea of building a community with a shared future for mankind through its national and global security concepts.While China's views on order and security embody international justice, the US focuses solely on its own interests, which override, in US's eyes, that of all other countries: China, Russia, and even its own allies and partners. In short, how the US interprets the security and order concepts is selfish, hegemonic and ultimately untenable. In his speech on Saturday, Austin emphasized one word: partnerships. ""… today, I want to talk about what that [the power of partnership] has meant in action, about how our partnerships have grown even stronger, and about how we've moved together toward our shared vision for the region,"" he noted. Austin's remarks are highly deceptive, as they elaborately package what the US thinks is for the good of all regional nations as a ""shared vision."" US believes Beijing and Moscow are posing threats to its hegemony in Asia-Pacific and EU, respectively, so the US hopes to suppress China and Russia by uniting its allies and partners. But for those countries, serving US hegemonic interests doesn't equal to peace and security. Instead, it actually undermines their interests to many extents. The US is constantly hyping China as a ""coercive and aggressive"" force in the region. Even though China has been insisting that its defense policy is defensive and that it seeks a peaceful rise, Austin still accused China of using its advantaged military power to challenge regional security and bully smaller nations. US wants to portray China as a direct and real threat to all the allies and partners it wants to rope in. However, when the US sets China as a target for attacks, the former has also woven lie after lie to justify the intention to safeguard its global hegemony. Once those lies are exposed, the US and its ""friends"" will only separate ways sooner and later.But US's lies barely have any appeal to states in the Asia-Pacific region. To put it bluntly, only few regional countries, such as Australia, Canada and Japan, are willing to follow the US closely. Others rather regard ties with Beijing as an important opportunity for development.The US is gradually losing its ability to make rules in many areas, including regional security, international order, and economy and trade. And such a trend has occurred not only in the Asia-Pacific region, but also all around the world. On the one hand, the US is losing its credibility for what it has done to other nations. On the other hand, the country's economic influence is slowly diminishing, as the dollar hegemony is ending due to an excessive usage of sanctions. In the end, the US will lose its hegemonic position. The ongoing Ukraine crisis was also a key issue addressed at the Shangri-La Dialogue. There have been voices worrying about whether the conflict will spill over to the Asia-Pacific region. In my opinion, the answer is no, because the history and reality of EU and Asia are entirely different. Some countries in EU are willing to act against Russia under US's incitement proactively. However, many Asia-Pacific countries view China as a friend and reliable economic partner, so for them, treating China as an enemy is impossible, let alone participating in an anti-China alliance. The author is a China military expert and TV commentator. opinion@globaltimes.com.cn",OPINION,VIEWPOINT,Illustration: Chen Xia/GT,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'US': ('LOC', 12), 'China': ('LOC', 10), 'Singapore': ('LOC', 1), 'Russia': ('LOC', 2), 'Beijing': ('LOC', 1), 'Moscow': ('LOC', 1), 'Asia': ('LOC', 1), 'Pacific': ('LOC', 1), 'Defense': ('ORG', 1), 'Council': ('ORG', 1), 'US First': ('ORG', 1), 'EU': ('ORG', 1), 'Lloyd Austin': ('PER', 4), 'Wei Fenghe': ('PER', 1), 'Shangri - La Dialogue': ('MISC', 1)}"
446,Chinese attendee refutes Western scholars’ déjà vu rumors against China over reaction to Zelensky’s speech at Shangri-La Dialogue,Global Times,2022-06-12,"The China delegation attending the Shangri-La Dialogue summit in Singapore has become the target of rumors again, when two West research fellows tweeted on Saturday that the China delegation walked out of the meeting room when Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky started his speech via video link. The allegation was soon clarified by a former US defense official who pointed out that it was the Vietnamese delegation who left the room and also dismissed as a rumor by a China attendee in the same meeting on Saturday.Zhang Yingli, former professor at the International College of Defense Studies at the China People's Liberation Army (PLA) National Defense University who was at the meeting, told the Global Times on Sunday that the allegation was totally fake news and purely a rumor blatantly made up by relevant personnel. Zhang attended the afternoon session on Saturday with four other China representatives and they all stayed at the meeting venue throughout Volodymyr Zelensky's speech via video link to the Q&A session. ""Obviously, this was fake news. Those who fabricated it harbored ulterior intentions and wanted to use the Ukraine situation to smear China and distort its international image,"" said Zhang. On Saturday, Olivia Enos, a senior policy analyst of Asia Studies Center at the Heritage Foundation, and Jonathan Eyal, associate director of the Royal United Services Institute for Defence and Security Studies, posted on Twitter that the China delegation left the meeting hall during the Shangri-La dialogue when Volodymyr Zelensky delivered his speech, questioning China's stance on the Ukraine situation. Several other accounts also tweeted similar contents. However, US former Department of Defense official Drew Thompson later replied to Olivia Enos that was the Vietnamese delegation who left and that he was sitting next to a senior colonel from the PLA delegation.Thompson added that since the Shangri-La dialogue summit had a very tight schedule, the Vietnamese delegation was probably simply heading to another meeting at 4:30 pm and the US Coast Guard Commandant also left early for other meetings.Both Olivia Enos and Jonathan Eyal haven't admitted their mistake nor apologized for it. Despite the deletion of the tweet, Olivia Enos commented below Thompson's clarification: ""Glad I wasn't the only one"" referring to the fact of mistaking the Vietnamese delegation for the China one. Jonathan Eyal hasn't even deleted the fake news as of press time.This isn't the first time the China delegation has become the target of rumors made up by some West parties. In late May, CNN interviewed Michael McCaul, a Republican from Texas, who took a photograph showing the China delegation seated while other people were giving a standing ovation, and that the members then left the room. He told CNN that the photo was sending a clear message they do not support Ukraine. But the delegation turned out to be the Vietnamese one, while the China delegation was meeting with International Energy Agency chief Fatih Birol at that time.Both the China delegation to Davos and the China Foreign Ministry refuted such claim. CNN later admitted in an email sent to the Global Times that it made a mistake in misreporting China delegation's reaction to Volodymyr Zelensky's speech. ""We regret the error appeared on our air… we reached out to McCaul's office for a statement,"" CNN said in the email.",CHINA,DIPLOMACY,"The Chinese delegation are seen at the meeting venue throughout Zelensky's speech on June 11, 2022 at the Shangri-La Dialogue summit in Singapore.

447,England held by Italy,AFP,2022-06-12,"England are bottom of their UEFA Nations League group without a win after drawing 0-0 with Italy in a repeat of the Euro 2020 final on Saturday, while Germany settled for a point in a 1-1 stalemate in Hungary.The meeting in Wolverhampton between Gareth Southgate's side and the EU champions was played before just 3,000 people, largely school-children, as a punishment for the incidents that marred the Euro 2020 final between the same nations at Wembley last year.UEFA rules say a match ordered to be played behind closed doors can still be attended by children accompanied by an adult, as happened last weekend when Hungary beat England in Budapest.England followed that reverse by drawing 1-1 in Germany and another draw at Molineux leaves them bottom of League A, Group 3 with just two points from three outings before they host Hungary at the same venue on Tuesday in their final game of a long campaign.Mason Mount hit the bar early on for England, while Aaron Ramsdale produced a fine save to deny Sandro Tonali for an Italy side featuring just two starters who also lined up in the EU Championship final.England manager Gareth Southgate blamed a run of three games without a win to start their Nations League campaign on a lack of sharpness in front of goal.Southgate labelled that situation as an ""embarrassment"" for the country and believed the lack of atmosphere played a part in another Nations League clash lacking verve at the end of an exhausting season.England's only goal in the last three games came from Harry Kane's late penalty to salvage a 1-1 draw away to Germany on Tuesday.""We had two or three really good chances we need to score, but just lacked that sharpness in front of goal,"" said Southgate.""You can see when you are pushing like we were in the second half, you don't have any crowd to help you or put the opposition under any pressure.""Roberto Mancini's Italy are rebuilding after failing to qualify for the World Cup and are top of the group after Hungary and Germany cancelled each other out in Budapest.Zsolt Nagy gave Hungary an early lead, smashing in after Manuel Neuer had palmed out a Rolland Salai header.However, Germany needed just three minutes to draw level as Borussia Moenchengladbach's Jonas Hofmann latched onto a long ball forward and rounded the goalkeeper before slotting in.""I said beforehand that this was the hardest game you could have after England,"" Germany coach Hansi Flick told RTL after his side's third consecutive 1-1 draw.""But we are in a development process. We have to see that we learn the lessons from this game.""Depay misses late penaltyThe Netherlands are top of League A, Group 4 after coming from two goals down to draw 2-2 with Poland in Rotterdam, but they could have claimed a third win in as many games had Memphis Depay not squandered a late penalty.English-born fullback Matty Cash gave Poland an 18th-minute lead with a fine low strike, and the visitors doubled their advantage five minutes after halftime as Przemyslaw Frankowski squared for Piotr Zielinski to finish.Yet the home side pulled one back almost immediately when Daley Blind's cross from the left was swept in by Davy Klaassen, and they were level by the 54th minute as Denzel Dumfries made it 2-2.They could have won it in stoppage time when Cash was penalised in the box, but Barcelona forward Depay saw his spot kick come back off the post. Meanwhile Brennan Boris Johnson - a star for Nottingham Forest as they won promotion to the Premier League this season - came off the bench to score a late leveller as Wales drew 1-1 with Belgium in Cardiff.Ireland hammer ScotlandYouri Tielemans gave Belgium the lead early in the second half in Cardiff, but Wales earned their first point of the Nations League campaign.Their attention had previously been on their decisive World Cup qualifying playoff against Ukraine, which they won 1-0 last weekend to qualify for the global showpiece for the first time since 1958.In League B, the Republic of Ireland got their first win in Group 1 in emphatic fashion, beating hapless Scotland 3-0 in Dublin.Alan Browne and Troy Parrott netted in the first half for Ireland before Michael Obafemi smashed in an emphatic third early in the second half.In the same group, Ukraine got their second win in as many games since losing to Wales, as they beat Armenia 3-0 in a match played in the Poland city of Lodz.",SPORT,MISCELLANY,"Giovanni di Lorenzo (left) of Italy and Raheem Sterling of England battle for the ball on June 11, 2022 in Wolverhampton, England.

448,China draws security red line to US at defense ministers’ longer-than-expected first meeting,GT staff reporters,2022-06-10,"The China military won't hesitate to fight anyone who dares to separate the island of Taiwan from China, China's State Councilor and Defense Minister Wei Fenghe told US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin during their first meeting in Singapore at the International Institute for Strategic Studies' (IISS) 19th Shangri-La Dialogue on Friday.With the purpose to use Taiwan island and topics on the China Sea to hype ""China threat,"" the US seeks to build an iron curtain between China and other Asia countries and to implement its ""Indo-Pacific Strategy"" by rallying allies, analysts said, noting that China is drawing a bottom line by reiterating its firm stance on the Taiwan question.After being canceled for two years due to COVID-19 pandemic, the IISS 19th Shangri-La Dialogue is taking place in Singapore from Friday to Sunday. The talks between Wei and Austin on Friday were the first meeting between China and US defense ministers since Austin took office in January 2021. Topics on the island of Taiwan, China Sea, and the Ukraine crisis had been discussed at the defense ministers' meeting.

Photo:China MilitaryThere is only one China, and Taiwan is a sacred, inalienable part of China's territory, Wei told Austin, noting that if anyone dares to separate Taiwan from China, the China military will not hesitate to fight, and will resolutely crush any ""Taiwan independence"" attempts at all cost to firmly safeguard national sovereignty and territorial integrity, senior Colonel Wu Weishan Qian, a spokesperson at China's Ministry of National Defense, said at a press conference after the meeting.Austin reiterated to Wei that the US remains committed to its longstanding one-China policy, which is guided by the Taiwan Relations Act, the Three US-China Joint Communiqués, and the Six Assurances. However, he also ""reaffirmed"" opposition to ""unilateral changes to the status quo,"" according to a press release from the US Department of Defense. The China defense minister's remarks stressed China's bottom line for the US as US has ramped up efforts to link the Russia-Ukraine conflict with the Taiwan question and create tensions in the region, analysts said. They lashed out at the US for taking ""a sausage cutting"" strategy to hollow out its one-China policy gradually and intensify the situation at the Taiwan Straits.Analysts said the US is attempting to shift its EU allies' focus to the Asia-Pacific region and also consolidate its alliance in Asia. Japan is the one that closely follows the US in using the current Russia-Ukraine crisis to hype the China mainland's ""threat"" to the island of Taiwan. Japan Prime Minister Fumio Kishida used the Russia-Ukraine conflict as an example to oppose ""unilateral changes"" to the status quo by force and unveil a plan to raise Japan's defense budgetThe US and its allies have stepped up efforts to promote the implementation of the ""Indo-Pacific Strategy"" this year, as it is trying to build an iron curtain between China and others in the Asia-Pacific region, Yang Xiyu, a senior research fellow at the China Institute of International Studies, told the Global Times on Friday.Yang said that the biggest difference in this year's Shangri-La Dialogue is that the Asia-Pacific region is now facing an unprecedented strategic instability. The conflict between Russia and Ukraine has spilled over to the world. NATO is going global, and West countries have deliberately added fuel to the fire by linking Ukraine with Taiwan, which are irrelevant.The US had built QUAD, AUKUS, and the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework, but China decided to confidently face them or integrate into them, Yang said, pointing out that China's choice to send its top defense official this year at this sensitive time shows China's confidence and strategic focus, as well as China's strategic sincerity of pushing the Asia-Pacific to integration and cooperation standing at the crossroads. 
Frank exchangesWei and Austin's meeting on Friday is of significance to implementing the important consensus between the two countries' top leaders and pushing forward the development of the two countries' military ties, said Senior Colonel Wu Weishan, noting the conversation was a frank, positive and constructive strategic communication.Both sides agreed that the two militaries should carefully implement the key consensus reached by the two countries' top leaders, keep frequent communication and manage risks and crises, Wu Weishan noted.The meeting between China and US defense ministers is an exchange of views at this historic moment, as China pushes the region toward integration and cooperation and away from separation and Cold War, Yang said.The significance of the meeting is that it proved the two countries' high-level conversation is sustainable. Even if the two sides crossed swords with words, being able to exchange views in a frank manner means both sides are willing to implement the consensus reached by the two countries' top leaders, Yang said.The conversation between the China and US defense ministers has a positive meaning to the deepening of strategic communication, the exploration in the construction of a ""guardrail"" for China-US relations, as well as the management of risk, Cao Yanzhong, a research fellow at the Academy of Military Sciences of the China People's Liberation Army (PLA), told the Global Times on Friday.When it comes to the ""guardrail"" for  China-US relations the US wants to build, China has already drawn three bottom lines the US should not cross during the two countries' meetings in Anchorage and Tianjin. The US should keep its promises, stop making provocations on the Taiwan question, stop expanding and enhancing military alliances and partnerships in its attempt to ""shape security environment of China,"" and stop trade sanctions and technology blockades, and take real actions to stabilize China-US relations and promote peace, Cao said.However, as the US insists on defining the bilateral relations with major power competition, there are two options for such competition to evolve: it can escalate to conflict, or it can pave the way for cooperation, Zhang Yingli, former professor at the International College of Defense Studies at the PLA's National Defense University, told the Global Times on Friday.The US military frequently carries out close-in reconnaissance and make provocations on China, and China's frontline troops have garnered rich experience and skills as they deal with them. This means China troops can carry out their duties in safeguarding national sovereignty very professionally and avoid possible accidents that could lead to crises from happening as much as possible, Zhang said. Analysts noted the US should also immediately stop arms sales to and military cooperation with the island of Taiwan, stop the highly frequent close-in reconnaissance on China as well as stop stirring up regional confrontation and security tensions in the Indo-Pacific region.",CHINA,DIPLOMACY,"Chinese and US defense chiefs hold their first face-to-face meeting in Singapore on June 10, 2022.

The US and Japan will never get what they want as China will keep improving ties with all peace-loving countries in the region,  experts claimed on Saturday.Deterring trouble-making forces""The China military won't hesitate to fight anyone who dares to separate the island of Taiwan from China,"" China's State Councilor and Defense Minister Wei Fenghe told US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin during their first meeting in Singapore at the International Institute for Strategic Studies' (IISS) 19th Shangri-La Dialogue on Friday.With the intention to use Taiwan island and topics related to the China Sea to hype the ""China threat"" theory, the US seeks to build an iron curtain between China and other Asia countries and to implement its ""Indo-Pacific Strategy"" by rallying allies, analysts said, noting that China is drawing a bottom line by reiterating its firm stance on the Taiwan question.Song Zhongping, a military expert and TV commentator, told the Global Times on Saturday that China and the US are making their points clearly to each other but there was no breakthrough in easing tensions. ""The problem is that the US' stance of 'opposing any unilateral changes to the status quo from either side' of Taiwan Straits is actually opposing the reunification of China, to keep the China mainland and the island of Taiwan separated from each other, and this is what China will never accept,"" Song said.The efforts that China has made to promote reunification, including strengthening military activities around the island and preparing to fight separatists and foreign forces, are actually the efforts for self-defense and safeguarding national sovereignty, Song said, noting that ""this is why the China defense chief stressed the People's Liberation Army (PLA) won't hesitate to fight. China must dominate the process of solving the Taiwan question.""Japan, as a US close ally who has ambition to seek more powerful military capability and the amendment of its Pacifist Constitution, is also trying to hype the China Threat theory at the Shangri-La Dialogue. Japan Prime Minister Fumio Kishida said in his speech on Friday that in the China Sea, ""unilateral attempts to change the status quo by force in violation of international law are continuing. Japan is taking a firm stand against such attempts."" And he also promoted the ""five pillars of initiatives"", with experts said these pillars and initiatives are all serving the real intention of making ""Japan a military power that is able to fight.""At the request by the China military delegation in the Shangri-La Dialogue, He Lei, former vice president of the Academy of Military Sciences of the People's Liberation Army, told the media when addressing  Kishida's speech that ""on the so-called issue of unilateral attempts to change the status quo by force in the China Sea, it was Japan who firstly and illegally 'nationalize' the Diaoyu Islands and other relevant island around the region. This has broken the tacit understanding to lay aside disputes on the issue which shared by the leaders of China and Japan, and this has seriously harmed China's sovereignty."" China won't accept Japan's move to put the label of ""changing the status quo by force"" on China, He noted.China military analysts said Japan is the country which has sought to change the status quo and when it failed to stop China from safeguarding its sovereignty in the Diayu Islands, it starts pretending to be a victim and to accuse China, but if one day it successfully get rid of the limitation of the Pacifist Constitution, it would likely to transform the country in to a war machine again as it has never thoroughly review its war crimes toward other countries in the World War II and the long-existing militarism, and this is not only a threat to China, South Korea and other Asia countries, but also to the US, as US is actually the biggest obstacle for Tokyo to gain more military power. Photo: Ministry of DefenseWorking together with local partnersApart from releasing warning and drawing redlines to the regional and non-regional forces who intended to interrupt the peace in the Asia-Pacific region, on Friday, the China military delegation also engaged with regional countries including South Korea and Singapore to express China's sincerity in exchanges and making joint effort to safeguard regional peace together with the regional partners.The Prime Minister of Singapore Lee Hsien Loong met with the visiting China State Councilor and Defense Minister General Wei Fenghe at the Istana on the afternoon of June 10, 2022.Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said the unique positioning of the all-round cooperative partnership progressing with the times between Singapore and China reflects the high level of the Singapore-China relationship. Both sides should continue to strengthen practical cooperation on anti-pandemic efforts, the economy and trade, and maintain the sound momentum of continuous development of bilateral ties.He pointed out that at present, the international situation and the Asia-Pacific region are undergoing new changes, and Singapore hopes that all countries in this region can advance communication and enhance mutual trust, and jointly add more positive factors to regional peace and stability.Wei said ""In face of the changes unseen in a century and the global pandemic, China and Singapore should constantly deepen strategic mutual trust, expand the integration of common interests, strengthen mutual support on issues concerning each other's core interests and major concerns, so as to inject positive energy into regional peace and stability.""He also said that in recent years, the relationship of two militaries has seen stable development, and both sides should continue to enhance high-level exchanges and pragmatic cooperation, in a bid to push forward the military-to-military relations.China and South Korea defense ministers also exchanged views on Friday at the Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore, which observers saw as an important and timely occasion for the two to engage in comprehensive communication to better understand each other and jointly work toward regional peace and security which is facing great challenges amid external interference. China State Councilor and Defense Minister Wei and South Korea Defense Minister Lee Jong-sup's meeting, the first since November 2019, came as tensions rise on the Korean Peninsula. Wei reiterated China's position of maintaining  peace on the Korean Peninsula and hopes China and South Korea will cooperate on realizing the denuclearization of the peninsula.China analysts said the atmospheres of the meetings with South Korea and Singapore are much more friendly and productive. Most peace-loving countries in the region respect China's sovereignty and national interests, and they realized that regional actors and China are in a community with shared future, and even if there are disputes, they are willing to solve the problem via negotiations rather than be used by the US to serve its China containment strategy. Song noted that ""this is reason why an Asia-Pacific version of NATO is unlikely to appear. The US and Japan's attempt of introducing the measure that instigated the Russia-Ukraine conflict in EU to Asia is doomed to fail.

451,Chinese delegation says Indo-Pacific Strategy ‘fanning confrontation’ as US defense chief made ‘most barefaced’ Shangri-La speech attacking China,GT staff reporters,2022-06-11,"US' Indo-Pacific Strategy is aimed at maintaining US hegemony, creating divisions and fanning confrontation, the China delegation said, refuting US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin's speech at the IISS Shangri-La Dialogue on Saturday as Austin took advantage of the stage to propagandize US' Indo-Pacific Strategy and to point finger at China. Zhang Zhenzhong, deputy chief of the Joint Staff Department in the Central Military Commission, told reporters on Saturday at the 19th Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore, that the Indo-Pacific Strategy is designed to trap the Asia-Pacific region into a geopolitical game and confrontation as it tries to form a small circle by roping in some countries to incite against others. It seriously impacts the ASEAN-centered regional cooperation architecture and seriously harms the overall and long-term interests of countries in the region, he added.""The US has already turned the Middle East and EU into a mess, does it want to mess up Asia-Pacific next?"" Zhang asked, adding that this is absolutely not allowed. Zhang said the US' strategy is designed to destroy peace. The mainstream voice of Asia-Pacific countries is peaceful coexistence and win-win cooperation, but the US, in contrast, advocates competition between major powers and creates military confrontation, sending warplanes to showcase its military might in the China Sea, launching military drills with allies, which all created tensions in the region. In conclusion, Zhang said that strategy served US' own interests against the common will of the regional countries, and stressed that for these reasons it must not succeed.Austin on Saturday gave an hour-long speech themed ""Next Steps for the US' Indo-Pacific Strategy,"" in which he called the strategy ""our priority theater of operations"" and ""at the heart of US grand strategy.""He also openly criticized China for being ""coersive and aggressive.""  Austin specifically raised the Taiwan question. ""The stakes are especially stark in the Taiwan Strait,"" he said, adding that US' policy on Taiwan was to remain opposed to any unilateral changes to the status quo. ""Our policy hasn't changed. But unfortunately, that doesn't seem to be true for the PRC,"" Austin noted.Austin's rhetoric can be translated as the US opposes China's reunification, Song Zhongping, a Beijing-based military expert, told the Global Times. With this is mind, Song said that Pentagon and the White House are attempting to internationalize and complicate the Taiwan question, which is a matter of China's domestic affairs. This mentality has been refuted by China in multiple occasions, including during the face-to-face meeting between China's State Councilor and Defense Minister Wei Fenghe and Austin in Singapore on Friday. There is only one China, and Taiwan is a sacred, inalienable part of China's territory, Wei told Austin, noting that if anyone dares to separate Taiwan island from China, the China military will not hesitate to fight, and will resolutely crush any ""Taiwan independence"" attempts at all cost to firmly safeguard national sovereignty and territorial integrity.On Saturday, Zhang also responded to Austin's hype over Taiwan question. Taiwan question is China's domestic affairs, the one-China principle is the political foundation of China-US ties, on which successive US governments have made clear commitments. President Joe Biden also stated that he does not support ""Taiwan independence,"" but the US' words are obviously not matched by its deeds, and US has kept playing the Taiwan card, severely obscuring and hollowing out the one-China policy, Zhang added. Zhang said that the Taiwan question can most likely lead China-US ties to conflict and confrontation. If not handled properly, it will have a subversive impact on the relationship between the two countries. There is only one China in the world, Taiwan is an inalienable part of China's territory, and the government of the China is the only legitimate government representing the whole China. This is the only correct understanding of ""one China."" The reunification of China is the aspiration of China people, and the national rejuvenation is unstoppable. The China People's Liberation Army (PLA) will stand ready to defend the country's sovereignty, security and territorial integrity at all costs.Hyping PLA's intercepts ""We've seen an alarming increase in the number of unsafe aerial intercepts and confrontations at sea by PLA aircraft and vessels,"" Austin said in his speech.In response to the remarks, Zhang said at the media briefing that the incident occurred near the maritime and airspace of China's Xisha and Nansha islands, not in the adjacent sea and airspace of US allies. The actions taken by the China military are necessary measures to deal with the provocations, and are reasonable, safe and professional.Prior to the Shangri-La Dialogue, China has already denounced Australia and Canada  ""disinformation"" over jet encounters. The two countries, however, turning a blind eye to the warnings from the China side, kept carrying out close-in reconnaissance and provocative activities by surveillance planes in East and China Seas. ""This is a dangerous act against China's national security and the safety of China and Canada front-line personnel,"" China Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Zhao Lijian said at a Regular Press Conference on June 6. These days, there has been analysis that the reason why Canada and Australia have not stopped hyping up the case is to create topics for the ongoing dialogue over Asia security, taking ""China threat"" theory to a new level. He Lei, lieutenant general and former vice president of the PLA Academy of Military Sciences, who is attending the Shangri-La Dialogue, told Global Times that Austin's accusations against PLA's aircraft interception obviously aimed at endorsing Canada and Australia, reinforcing US-led small circles. Austin talks about ""common vision"" in Indo-Pacific region, but what US has shown is its clear-targeted and exclusive behaviors, He added.

After Ukraine, US-led NATO wants to turn Asia Pacific into a new powder keg. Illustration: Carlos LatuffMost barefaced accusationsAustin also hyped up territorial disputes in the Indo-Pacific region, naming East and China Sea issues, and border disputes with India. ""Indo-Pacific countries shouldn't face political intimidation, economic coercion, or harassment,"" Austin said. ""We'll do our part to manage these tensions responsibly,"" he added.Lieutenant General He said Austin's speech is the most blatant and most comprehensive slander against China compared to previous US defense chiefs' remarks at the summit, as this is the first time that a Pentagon chief raised Taiwan question, the China Sea, the China Sea issue, and China-India border dispute all at the same time. Zhao Xiaozhuo, a research fellow at the Academy of Military Sciences of the PLA, told the Global Times that US real intention is to boost its alliance system, mobilizing its allies to maintain the US' versions of rules-based international order, shaping China's peripheral environment, piling enough pressure on China and eventually realize the containment of China's emergence. Observers say Austin's speech mirrors that the US opposes everything China does to safeguard its own national security and interests. And it is largely due to incitement of outside forces, especially the US and its allies, contradictions and disputes in Indo-Pacific region come to where it is today.By hyping up tensions and so-called China threat, the US is trying to drive a wedge between China and regional countries, while kidnapping more countries to its side to coordinate with its Indo-Pacific Strategy. And the US could paint itself as ""entitled"" to play the role as an arbitrator of the region, far away from its own soil, and take Asia affairs under its control, Wei Dongxu, a Beijing-based military expert, told the Global Times. However, most Asia countries do not want to take a side in major power games. During the 2019 Shangri-La Dialogue, Singaporean Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong raised concerns, ""Unfortunately, when the lines start to get drawn, everybody asks: Are you my friend or not my friend? And that makes it difficult for the small countries."" On the Taiwan question, the majority of regional countries refuse to dance to the US tune, as they are well aware that the US is an outsider, and has no right to intervene in China's domestic affairs, Wei said. Hegemonic mentalityDuring the speech Austin brought up the so-called rules-based international order to cover US intentions. He took the Russia-Ukraine conflict as an example. ""The Ukraine crisis poses some urgent questions for US all... And I am here because the rules-based international order matters just as much in the Indo-Pacific as it does in EU,"" he said. This is an arrogant, hegemonic mentality, Wei told Global Times. Wei said the so-called rules are not at all fair and square rules which are accepted by the international community, but a US-dominated one, in which the US is the one and only boss and other has to listen to it. The Ukraine crisis is a proof that US-led rules have caused great harm to US allies and EU as a whole. Not to mention the emerging energy and food crisis, increasing EU countries are losing their diplomatic independence and autonomy, experts said. During the ongoing Summit of the Americas, questions toward US-led rules-based orders are surfacing. It signals that be it Indo-Pacific regions or wider range of the international community, hypes of the US over so-called tensions will find fewer countries to join in the chorus, Wei said. Although the US has this intention to shape events, and it has some followers like Japan, Australia and those who are far from the region like the UK and Canada, it's plan won't be realized, said Lü Xiang, an expert on international relations and US studies at the China Academy of Social Sciences.""Only the countries with enough power and strength, as well as the support from the most regional countries, are able to shape the strategic environment in a specific region. In the Asia-Pacific region, the US is not such a country, but China is,"" he said.Although Austin outlined some ambitious plans in his speech, but it's questionable to all regional countries that to what extent the US can make its plan come true, experts said. The countries named by Austin, Indonesia, Singapore and Vietnam  all have stable and friendly ties with China. Even if there are some differences or disputes, they prefer to solve the problems with China rather than be blindly used by the US to pay for its costly confrontation with China, said analysts.",CHINA,DIPLOMACY,"US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin speaks at the Shangri-La Dialogue summit in Singapore on June 11, 2022.

453,"Japan hijacks Asia with NATO collusion push, endangers region",Yang Sheng,2022-06-10,"Japan Prime Minister Fumio Kishida is set to deliver a keynote speech at the Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore on Friday, during which he will reportedly use Russia-Ukraine conflict as an example to oppose unilateral changes to the status quo by force and unveil a plan to raise Japan's defense budget, three days after Japan agreed to step up military ties with NATO due to concerns of the Russia-Ukraine conflict and extended an olive branch to NATO's involvement in the Asia-Pacific region. China analysts believed that Japan is now using the Russia-Ukraine crisis to strengthen its military cooperation with NATO, and trying to channel NATO's influence into the Asia-Pacific region or promote the establishment of a NATO-like military alliance in the region, and such ill-intended plans actually hijacked regional peace and stability to serve its ambition of strengthening its military power, containing China with a military alliance, and getting rid of the constraints  of its Pacifist Constitution. Japan uses the pretext of ""preventing a crisis like the Russia-Ukraine crisis from happening in Asia"" to legitimize its move to collude with NATO and to convince regional countries to serve its goal of targeting China, but in fact, the expansion of NATO is the root cause of the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, so if a NATO-like military organization emerges in Asia, the region would come much closer to a military crisis, said experts.Tokyo's selfish and dangerous attempt is unlikely to succeed, as China and other peace-loving regional countries will work together to keep the region away from the regional militarization and confrontation which is happening in EU, China analysts noted.  Japan's ambitionJapanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida is set to present his country's vision for a more secure Asia-Pacific region through maritime cooperation with 20 or more nations when he speaks at the Shangri-La security dialogue on Friday in Singapore, government sources said, according to Kyodo News on Thursday. Noting that the status quo ""has already been changed by force in the East and China Seas,"" Kishida is expected to convey his plan to assist Asia-Pacific nations by providing patrol boats and constructing maritime transport infrastructure while investing in the necessary human resources.He is set to call for efforts to ""prevent a crisis similar to that in Ukraine from arising in the Indo-Pacific as well as underscoring the importance of peace and stability across the Taiwan Straits.""In fact, Japan is not trying to safeguard regional peace and stability, but to create tensions and trouble by hyping the ""China threat theory"" so that Japan can legitimize its ambition to develop military force and push for an amendment of its Pacifist Constitution, Lü Yaodong, a research fellow with the Institute of Japan Studies under the China Academy of Social Sciences, said on Thursday.If Asia remains peaceful and stable, Tokyo won't have an excuse to break the limitations of its constitution, get rid of US control and become a normalized country, said analysts, noting that it's not just simply serving the US, but using the current situation in Ukraine and the US Indo-Pacific strategy to realize its own ambitions by creating tensions in the region, Lü noted. On Tuesday, Japan and NATO officials agreed to step up military cooperation and joint exercises over shared concerns that the Russia-Ukraine conflict is ""causing a deterioration of the security environment in EU and Asia,"" the Associated Press reported.Japan Defense Minister Nobuo Kishi said at the beginning of his meeting with NATO Military Committee chief Rob Bauer that Japan hopes to strengthen its ties with EU countries and welcomes NATO's expanded involvement in the Asia-Pacific region, the report said. ""The security of EU and Asia are closely intertwined, especially now with the international community facing serious challenges,"" Kishi said. Bauer's visit to Tokyo comes as Japan's Maritime Self Defense Force participates in NATO naval exercises in the Mediterranean Sea, according to the report. This kind of collusion between Japan and NATO under the pretext of security will be of no help in preventing conflicts, but could seriously damage regional peace and increase uncertainties, said analysts. Liu Jiangyong, vice dean of the Institute of Modern International Relations at Tsinghua University, told the Global Times on Thursday that Japan's move to introduce NATO's influence into Asia or push for the establishment of an Asia-Pacific version of NATO ""will bring danger not only to China but also the whole Asia-Pacific region.""""Firstly, Japan will strengthen its military power, and as a country that has been defeated by the allies in World War II, Japan could finally realize a military rise; secondly, Asia would experience tensions like those in EU caused by NATO expansion; thirdly, it will bring obstacles to the process of China's reunification, and even send a wrong signal to encourage Taiwan secessionists; moreover, Japan would increase pressure to target China's law-enforcement over the Diaoyu Islands,"" Liu noted.  Currently, due to the constraints imposed by its Pacifist Constitution, Japan cannot join NATO, but it is possible for it to amend relevant articles and then apply for NATO membership, which would make NATO a global military bloc not only with influence in EU, but one that enables the US and Japan to build a new military alliance to seriously threaten China's development and security, Liu said.Stopping a dangerous trendChina opposes some forces using the Ukraine crisis as an excuse to advocate NATO's further expansion into the Asia-Pacific region, said China State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi on May 13 during a phone conversation with Greek Foreign Minister Nikos Dendias. The two sides exchanged views on the Ukraine situation and bilateral relations. Attempts to create an ""Asia-Pacific version of NATO"" will only do serious harm to regional security, Wang said.Song Zhongping, a military expert and TV commentator, told the Global Times on Thursday that although Japan has ambitions to push the establishment of an Asia-Pacific version of NATO, Asia is not EU, and doesn't really have the conditions for building a military alliance like NATO. ""Most Asia countries, even those aligned with the US like South Korea and the Philippines, do not see China as their enemy or a threat, because China is their biggest trade partner and these countries enjoy concrete benefits from their stable ties with China,"" Song noted. After some frictions in the past few years on issues such as the China Sea and the THAAD crisis, most countries in the region have already learned that serving a US strategy to contain and provoke China brings nothing good but only losses and pressure, and they also realized that having stable and friendly relations with China is significant to their national interests, so Asia countries don't share the same thinking as Japan and don't want to be China's enemy, said analysts. Japan has decided to hijack the whole region, and is even inviting NATO to step into the Asia-Pacific region to contain China, and what China needs to do is to strengthen its ties with the regional countries to build a community of shared future and reach a consensus with peace-loving countries in Asia, Song said. ""China's development is not a threat to Asia, but a certainty for peace and prosperity of the continent,"" Song said, noting that ""in other words, whoever challenges China's development and sovereignty is challenging regional peace and stability.""Furthermore, China needs to strengthen its capabilities in all aspects, including the economy and military, to effectively deter all provocations that target China's core interests, and to isolate and effectively and overwhelmingly defeat the hostile forces that try to challenge and harm China's sovereignty and national security, to minimize the impact on regional peace and stability, Song noted.",CHINA,DIPLOMACY,Fumio Kishida  File Photo:AFP,"Reporter, Beijing","Yang Sheng is a chief reporter at the Global Times covering Chinese politics, diplomacy and military.","{'Japan': ('LOC', 6), 'Singapore': ('LOC', 2), 'Ukraine': ('LOC', 6), 'Asia': ('LOC', 6), 'Pacific': ('LOC', 5), 'China': ('LOC', 6), 'Tokyo': ('LOC', 1), 'Japanapanese': ('LOC', 1), 'Shan': ('LOC', 1), 'La': ('LOC', 1), 'Indo': ('LOC', 1), 'Taiwan Straits': ('LOC', 1), 'Fumio Kishida': ('PER', 2), 'Kishi': ('PER', 1), 'Shangri - La Dialogue': ('MISC', 1), 'Russia': ('MISC', 4), 'Pacist Constitution': ('MISC', 1), 'NATO': ('ORG', 8), 'EU': ('ORG', 1)}"
454,The illegal transfer of nuclear weapons materials involved in AUKUS cannot be denied: Chinese envoy,Global Times,2022-06-10," The Australia-UK-US (AUKUS) trilateral nuclear submarine cooperation violated the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), the comprehensive safeguards agreement of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and additional protocol signed between Australia and the IAEA, China's Permanent Representative to the UN in Vienna Wang Qun said on Thursday, noting the US, the UK and Australia must give an account to the international community.No matter what name the three countries give to the AUKUS and how they handle relevant nuclear weapon materials, the essence of the illegal transfer of nuclear weapon materials involved in AUKUS cannot be denied, Wang said.Wang made the remarks when addressing a meeting of the IAEA Board of Governors, which deliberated the issue of the transfer of nuclear materials in the context of AUKUS and its safeguards in all aspects under the NPT.The China envoy said the AUKUS has a far-reaching negative impact on global strategic stability, security order and regional peace and stability, which should be politically responded to by relevant international and regional security mechanisms.The three countries cannot repeatedly stick heads in the sand and must earnestly fulfill their legal obligations on non-proliferation. As a nonnuclear weapon state under the NPT, Australia must promptly and comprehensively declare its nuclear weapons materials and related facilities at all stages, Wang said, noting paper cannot wrap up fire.The US and the UK have applied double standards on nuclear proliferation issues, as they imposed unilateral sanctions on civilian nuclear programs of some nonnuclear weapon states, while at the same time blatantly transferred nuclear weapon material to Australia, Wang said.Such double standards have a disastrous impact on the international non-proliferation regime and the resolution of hotspot issues, including the Iran nuclear issue and the Korean Peninsula's nuclear issue, the China envoy said.Some countries insist on ""centralism"" and ""exceptionalism,"" Cold War mentality and hegemony and pursue bloc politics, which goes against the trend of history and will only trigger conflicts and split the international community, Wang said.In September 2021, the US, the UK and Australia announced the establishment of AUKUS, under which the US and the UK will assist Australia in its acquisition of nuclear-powered submarines.Global Times",CHINA,DIPLOMACY,"China's Permanent Representative to the United Nations in Vienna Wang Qun attends a meeting convened by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Board of Governors to discuss the situation in Ukraine, at Vienna, Austria, March 2, 2022.

456,"China, S.Korea defense chiefs agree to enhance exchanges, as a peaceful peninsula is in their interests",Zhang Han,2022-06-10," China and South Korea defense ministers exchanged views on Friday at the Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore, which observers saw as an important and timely occasion for the two to have a comprehensive communication to better understand each other and jointly work toward regional peace and security which is facing great challenges amid external interference. China State Councilor and Defense Minister Wei Fenghe and South Korea Defense Minister Lee Jong-sup's meeting, the first since November 2019, came as tensions rise on the Korean Peninsula. Wei reiterated China's stance to maintain peace on the Korean Peninsula and hopes China and South Korea will cooperate on realizing the denuclearization of the peninsula.2022 marks the 30th anniversary of the establishment of China-South Korea diplomatic relations, and Wei and Lee noted both sides should enhance practical cooperation based on mutual respect and shared interests, Yonhap reported.Wei hopes exchanges will be deepened between the defense authorities and militaries of the two countries. They also agreed to push forward mutual visits of defense ministers, strategic dialogue and other exchange activities. On June 2, the two countries set two new military hotlines, bringing the total number to five. The same day, China's top diplomat Yang Jiechi had a phone conversation with South Korea's Head of the Office of National Security Kim Sung-han, noting bilateral relations are off to a good start since the new South Korea government took office. Wei and Lee's meeting, with the Korean Peninsula issue on top of the agenda, also provided an opportunity for China and the Yoon government to have comprehensive communication to better understand each other's policies and avoid unilateral moves that could bring obstacles to hard-fought bilateral friendliness or further shaken regional security, Lü Chao, an expert on the Korean Peninsula issue at the Liaoning Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times on Thursday. The latest peninsula tension was sparked by combined military exercises of South Korea and the US last week involving an US aircraft carrier, the first in more than four years, after which North Korea launched missiles on Sunday in response. As the Korean Peninsula issue enters a dangerous downward spiral, China observers stressed that any party should be restrained to prevent further tensions. Song Zhongping, a China military expert and TV commentator, believes there is an important message China wants to deliver — a peaceful peninsula is consistent with both China and South Korea's interests and the issue should be handled in a peaceful way rather than ""setting the wolf to keep the sheep"" and allow the US to exert maximum pressure on North Korea. As a non-regional power, the US won't care about playing out of the tensions and the costs to China, South and North Korea when conflicts over the Peninsula issue get out of control, experts said, citing the Russia-Ukraine crisis. China, upholding the principle of pushing for dialogue and political solution to the peninsula issue, vetoed a US-backed resolution to impose more sanctions against North Korea at the UN. Blindly adding sanctions will not help solve the problem and it's inhumane. Dialogue is the only feasible way, Xing Haiming, China Ambassador to South Korea, explained China's decision during a TV interview with South Korea media on Thursday.China respects South Korea's traditional alliance with the US, and is happy to see regional countries develop bilateral and multilateral relations based on friendly cooperation, but only if such relations do not target China, Xing said, stressing that ""the Asia-Pacific should be a high ground for peaceful development, not a geopolitical arena.""

The first batch of THAAD components arrives in South Korea. Photo: CFPSouth Korean President Yoon Suk-yeol had pledged to deploy an additional THAAD battery in South Korea during the election campaign. According to Korea Times on Friday, Seoul is thinking of enabling the full-fledged operation of a THAAD anti-missile unit, which has been in ""temporary installation"" pending an environmental impact assessment.South Korea has been claiming the THAAD is defensive. However, Song said the system is equipped with radar that can effectively detect China's objectives of strategic depth. It is not only an interception system, but also a monitoring and early warning system, posing a serious threat to China's national security, the expert said. Such a system will break the power balance in Northeast and East Asia, seed unrest and threaten China's security environment, and add fuel to the current tensions, even risking a military conflict on the Korean Peninsula, Song warned. Xing said in the televised interview that on the THAAD issue, the most sensitive topic in China-South Korea relations, China understands South Korea's security demand but South Korea should also understand China's concerns.Xing said the lessons from the past must be learned and the two sides should properly manage the issue and avoid making it a prominent point or impact the hard-fought friendliness in bilateral relations. According to Yonhap, Wei raised concerns over South Korea's engagement with the US' Indo-Pacific Strategy to contain China, and the deployment of THAAD. The meeting lasted 75 minutes, longer than the scheduled 40 minutes and Lee told reporters the talks ""were very useful, and it was such a good opportunity for the two sides to understand each other.""",CHINA,DIPLOMACY,China and South Korea.

457,Chinese defense minister vows to fight ‘Taiwan independence’ in 1st face-to-face meeting with Austin,Global Times,2022-06-10," China and US defense chiefs on Friday held their first face-to-face meeting in Singapore, with China State Councilor and Defense Minister General Wei Fenghe reiterating China's firm position on the Taiwan question, stressing the China military will not hesitate to fight, and will resolutely crush any ""Taiwan independence"" attempts to firmly safeguard national sovereignty and territorial integrity.Wei and US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin on Friday met in Singapore, which is of significance to implementing the important consensus between the two countries' top leaders and pushing forward the development of the two countries' military ties, Senior Colonel Wu Weishan Qian, a spokesperson of China's Ministry of National Defense, said at a press conference after the meeting.They exchanged views on topics including China-US relations, military ties, the Taiwan question, the situation in the China Sea, and the Ukraine issue, Wu Weishan said.It was a frank, positive and constructive strategic communication, Wu Weishan said.Both sides agreed that the two militaries should carefully implement the key consensus reached by the two countries' top leaders, keep frequent communication and manage risks and crises, Wu Weishan noted.

China and US defense chiefs holds their first face-to-face meeting in Singapore on June 10, 2022. Photo: Ministry of Defense Wei reiterated China's firm stance on the Taiwan question. There is only one China, and Taiwan is a sacred, inalienable part of China's territory, Wei said, noting that the one-China principle is the political foundation of China-US relations, and attempting to contain China with the Taiwan question will fail.Wei said that the US recently announced another arms sale to the island of Taiwan, which seriously violated the one-China principle and the three China-US Joint Communiqués, severely harmed China's sovereignty and security interests, and badly damaged China-US relations as well as peace and stability in the Taiwan Straits. China firmly opposes and strongly condemns this.If anyone dares to separate Taiwan from China, the China military will not hesitate to fight, and will resolutely crush any ""Taiwan independence"" attempts at all cost, and firmly safeguard national sovereignty and territorial integrity, Wei said, according to Wu Weishan statement.On the China Sea, Wei said that countries in the region are willing to have the wisdom to deal with questions concerning the China Sea. The interference by external forces is the biggest uncertain factor in the region.The US should take concrete measures and do more for the stability of the China Sea, instead of stirring up trouble, inciting disputes and hyping confrontation, Wu Weishan quoted Wei as saying.On the Ukraine issue, Wei pointed out that China always upholds the principle of objectivity and fairness, and is making efforts to promote peace and talks. As a responsible major power, China will continue to play a constructive role, but if anyone wants to make use of the Ukraine issue to harm China's interests, China will respond resolutely with countermeasures, Wei said.Wu Weishan said the meeting was not long but yielded positive effect. For the next step, the two sides will discuss issues on communication and cooperation between the two militaries through military and diplomatic channels.",CHINA,MILITARY,Photo: China Military,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'China': ('LOC', 20), 'US': ('LOC', 7), 'Singapore': ('LOC', 3), 'Taiwan': ('LOC', 9), 'China Sea': ('LOC', 23), 'Ukraine': ('LOC', 1), 'Taiwan Straits': ('LOC', 10), 'Council': ('ORG', 1), 'Defense': ('ORG', 1), 'Ministry of National Defense': ('ORG', 2), 'Ministry of Defense': ('ORG', 2), 'Wei Fenghe': ('PER', 7), 'Lloyd Austin': ('PER', 1), 'Wu Weishan Qian': ('PER', 1), 'Wu Weishan': ('PER', 3), 'Wu Wei': ('PER', 7), 'one': ('MISC', 1), 'US Joint Comm': ('MISC', 1)}"
458,European Parliament attempts to hijack real public opinion toward China in EU,Global Times,2022-06-08,"As the only directly elected body of the seven EU (EU) institutions, the EU Parliament (EP) often portrays itself as ""the voice of the people."" But in recent years, it has packaged the hostility of some EU politicians toward China as public opinion, trying to hijack the actual view of Europeans toward China.A report on the EU and the security challenges in the Indo-Pacific adopted by the EP at its plenary session on Tuesday claims that China poses a threat to the Union's interests in the region, criticizing China's position on the Ukraine crisis and Taiwan, Hong Kong, Macao, and Xinjiang-related issues.In response, a spokesperson of the China Mission to the EU said that the report is based on ideological bias, distorts China's policy and position, plays up the ""China threat,"" denies the country's legitimate right to safeguard its sovereignty and security, and grossly interferes with its internal affairs.Cui Hongjian, director of the Department of EU Studies at the China Institute of International Studies, told the Global Times that the adopted report does not necessarily represent the position of the whole Union. The China scholar believes that the EP has become a place for political performances, especially over China-related issues in the past years.On the one hand, due to the separation of powers in the EU's institutions, the EP has to constantly increase its presence through political performances to gain or consolidate its say in the EU's decision-making.""Judging from the procedure of policy-making in the Union, a policy is generally proposed by the EU Commission and then discussed and approved by the EP and the EU Council. But now the EP often attempts to exert influence over the Union's policy, even before a policy proposal has been formed on the part of the EU Commission,"" noted Cui.On the other, the growing populism in EU is exemplified in the parliament. This EU body must rely on giving such political performances to support itself, since it acts quite unprofessionally and against common sense in many areas involving foreign affairs.Unlike other EU institutions, the EP has a unique, deep concern over human rights issues. Thus, this legislative body can easily go to extremes regarding human rights.In recent years, the EP appears to have developed a new characteristic: Hyping China-related topics, including through ridiculous exaggerations or distortions of China's human rights situation. It has created obstacles for those who want to advance China-EU relations in EU.Some of the EP's statements and actions - hostile and reckless in China's eyes - have seriously affected the political mutual trust between the two sides. According to Cui, they will also undermine Beijing's faith in EU institutions, because it seems the parliament now tends to be hasty in making statements on many China-related issues, such as Xinjiang-related ones, without any hard evidence.In addition, the EP could interfere with the policy decisions of other EU institutions, especially those advocating cooperation with China, limiting the space for pragmatic cooperation between China and EU.Most importantly, the EP, as a self-proclaimed representation of public opinion, aims to influence the true opinion of EU society. Under its impact, public opinion in EU has grown increasingly hostile toward China, which, in turn, encourages some EU politicians to continue the hype of the ""China threat.""As a result, the formation of public opinion in EU toward China ends up in a vicious circle. The social and public opinion basis in EU for cooperation and engaging with China is being gradually destroyed.",OPINION,OBSERVER,"The European Union flags in front of EU headquarters in Brussels, Belgium.

460,China doubles down on trade stabilization to ensure Q2 growth,Xie Jun,2022-06-09," China on Wednesday doubled down on efforts to stabilize its economy, with a slew of new measures introduced for the trade sector as part of an imperative push to ensure the economy's reasonable growth over the second quarter. The fresh official avowal is envisioned to support the trade sector out of a low ebb, experts said, estimating that China's trade could grow by more than 5 percent over the whole of 2022, thereby effectively underpinning the larger economic revival. An executive meeting of the State Council, the country's cabinet, on Wednesday called for ramped-up support for the country's foreign trade and investment.The meeting presided over by Premier Li Keqiang vowed tax rebates in stages within three working days for businesses with sound creditworthiness in export tax rebates, an expansion of imports of high-quality goods and an acceleration in port loading, unloading, transshipment and customs clearance. Free trade deals such as the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership would be banked on to facilitate trade, per the meeting readout published by Xinhua News Agency.Greater policy support The meeting also eyed maintaining global supply chain stability and a phased reduction and exemption of port-related charges, as well as urging the creation of a market-oriented and law-abiding international business environment to lure foreign businesses into the domestic investment. The cabinet meeting stressed that downward pressure on the economy remains prominent and that it is imperative to effectively coordinate coronavirus containment efforts with economic and social development. Local governments across the country are requested to earnestly shoulder the responsibility of ensuring the well-being of local people's livelihoods and push for the implementation of economic stability policies with a sense of urgency so there will be reasonable economic growth in the second quarter.Earlier on Wednesday, officials announced the rollout of about a dozen measures to solve the bottlenecks currently faced by the domestic trade sector, ranging from sustaining loans for small enterprises and maintaining smooth logistics as the nation's production and logistics gradually return to normal.At a press conference on Wednesday morning, China's Vice Commerce Minister Wang Shouwen elaborated on the newest package of policies China is ready to take to help relieve the difficulties faced by domestic trade companies. A key part of the 13 measures is ensuring the smooth running of logistics.According to Wang, China will set a catalogue for key trade companies and logistics companies to safeguard their production, logistics and employment. It is also including trade commodities into the scope of crucial resources to smooth out logistics at sea ports and airports. In terms of financial support, the China government will expand the short-term insurance scale of export credit insurance, especially for small and micro businesses. It will also support banking institutions not to cut or suppress loans for trade companies, while increasing the strength of promotion and training for companies on exchange rate risk aversion and cross-border renminbi payment settlement, according to the press conference.  Wang said that China will improve and innovate online exhibitions to help companies obtain more orders, as well as encourage overseas consumers to purchase China brand automobiles. ""The Ministry of Commerce will direct local governments to roll out localized support measures that target trade difficulties, so companies can achieve stable growth by enjoying policy bonuses amid the uncertainties,"" Wang said. China is rolling out policies to support trade companies at a time when the sector is facing both unexpected short-term blows, arising from Omicron outbreaks in metropolises like Shenzhen and Shanghai, and challenges on a longer basis, including the influence of West sanctions against Russia and the Ukraine crisis, which will exert a negative influence on China's industrial chain stability and in turn affect China's trade supply side, experts said. The global grain and energy crisis will also influence China's bulk commodity transaction price and further affect global demands for China products, they said. ""The consequences of those challenges will add up in China's trade supply and demand sides and emerge gradually, with China's trade scale and growth likely to edge down sharply in the second quarter after going through a temporary peak in Q1,"" Chen Jia, a research fellow at the International Monetary Institute of the Renmin University of China, told the Global Times on Wednesday.China's exports growth fell to 3.9 percent in April, compared with 14.7 percent in the previous month, the weakest level since June 2020, customs data showed. The pro-trade measures epitomize the country's broad-based push for an economic revival that centers on the genuinely efficient implementation of varied policy measures.The cabinet meeting on Wednesday reiterated a call for policy implementation by governments at varying levels. At a keenly watched video conference with upwards of 100,000 participants on May 25, the premier urged policies crystallized by the Central Economic Work Conference in December and the annual government work report this March to be basically implemented in the first half. In addition, a slew of stabilization policies unveiled at an earlier State Council executive meeting ought to be complemented by rules for implementation by the end of May.The General Office of the State Council would also circulate typical issues found in a special inspection around 12 provinces and regions of policy implementation aimed at stabilizing growth and ensuring market entities and employment. Furthermore, the general office would oversee the overhaul efforts in the wake of the inspection.Trade rebound On the other hand, the measures are being launched at a time when China's economy is stepping out of the darkest period amid the recent coronavirus outbreaks, and sectors like logistics are starting to return to normal, which will support a turnaround in the trade sector as well, experts said. ""Now that companies have resumed production for a certain period of time, and logistics are normal, the trade sector is ready to rebound under policy support,"" Hu Qimu, chief research fellow at the Sinosteel Economic Research Institute, told the Global Times on Wednesday. Experts are generally positive about China's trade situation and the general economy in the second half of this year, despite some gloomy projections on China's economic prospects this year by overseas institutions.The World Bank recently lowered its prediction of China's 2022 GDP growth to 4.3 percent, from the 8.1 percent growth of 2021.According to Hu, the recent disruptions in the second quarter are unlikely to shake China's trade situation in the whole year, as China's position in global industrial chains cannot be replaced easily due to its advantages in the business environment, labor force maturity and other areas. ""China's competitiveness has not changed. It is still the world's manufacturing basis,"" Hu said, adding that China's low inflation will make its products the best choice for many countries, and there may possibly be a wave of orders reflow back into China in the upcoming months as overseas countries search for solutions to relieve inflation pressure. Tian Yun, a veteran macroeconomic analyst, also told the Global Times on Wednesday that China's incremental trade volume in 2022 should still be the largest among global economies, if its trade growth rate might not get to the top.According to him, as long as other countries' product price continues a surging trend, there's space for China's exports to grow. Besides, the rebound of China's internal market demands will also benefit some trade companies. He predicted that China's exports and imports might grow by around 6 percent in 2022.",SOURCE,ECONOMY,"Aerial photo of Shanghai's Yangshan Port on April 24, 2022 Photo: cnsphoto","Reporter, Shanghai","Global Times reporter based in Shanghai, covering financial news and breaking news related to large corps surrounding Shanghai.","{'China': ('LOC', 5), 'State Council': ('ORG', 1), 'Xinhua News Agency': ('ORG', 1), 'Li Keqiang': ('PER', 1), 'Wang': ('PER', 2), 'Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership': ('MISC', 1)}"
461,Belarus finds new logistics route via Russia for exports to China which are expected to increase: Belarusian official,Global Times,2022-06-09,"The photo taken on November 7, 2019 shows the booth of Belarus products at the second China International Import Expo in Shanghai. Photo: VCGExports of Belarus agricultural products to China have witnessed continuous increase in the past years, and Belarus officials and enterprises said that the potential for bilateral trade is still there and they are constantly exploiting it.Belarus has found new transport routes through the territory and ports of Russia, instead of Ukraine, and therefore maintained smooth logistics chain to China, a Belarus official revealed on Wednesday at a webinar on China-Belarus agriculture cooperation.More than 340 China and Belarus enterprises attended the event which the Belarus Embassy in China said is the largest of its kind held by the embassy.""Today, Belarus producers from various regions of Belarus and China partners from various provinces and cities in China, are participating in our forum, which once again underlines the importance of interregional cooperation,"" Yuri Senko, Belarus Ambassador to China, said on Wednesday at the webinar.At present, more than 150 Belarus food exporters have been successfully registered in the China customs system. They are producers of dairy products, frozen beef, chicken, fish, confectionery, wine and other food products, Senko detailed.A growing number of Belarus products can be seen in China's stores and on major e-commerce platforms, said Senko.Since 2017, the share of Belarus's agricultural and food exports to China has increased from 3.2 percent to 41.7 percent. In many categories, Belarus is among the top 10 suppliers to China, the ambassador noted.""I also encourage you to develop economic cooperation in other areas, such as investment. Belarus has a China-Belarus Industrial Park named Great Stone, as well as several free economic zones, which provide good conditions for investors,"" said Senko.Alla Lomakina, Deputy Minister of Agriculture and Food of Belarus, further introduced that in the first quarter of 2022, about $104 million of Belarus food and agricultural raw materials were exported to China, up 62 percent from the same period in 2021.Meat products accounted for a large share of exports, which totaled $77.8 million, up 3.8 times year-on-year. Meanwhile, frozen beef exports increased 5.9 times to $56.49 million. In second place was milk and dairy products, with exports of nearly $24 million, according to Lomakina.""As we have mentioned on many occasions, the cooperation between China and Belarus has been carried out in many fields. Agricultural products and food account for a considerable proportion of Belarus's exports to China,"" said the deputy minister.Since late February this year, Belarus exporters have faced the logistical problem of being unable to send goods to China through Ukraine.""So far, the situation has stabilized with the connection of new transport routes through the territory and ports of Russia. It is expected that with the accumulation of logistics experience on the new route, the export of meat and dairy products from Belarus to China will maintain a positive growth momentum,"" said Lomakina.The president of Belgospishcheprom, the Belarus state consortium on the food industry and one of the largest food producers in the country, said at Wednesday's event that China is a very important trading partner for them.""Over the years, we have supplied a wide range of products to China, including sugar, confectionery, baby food, alcohol products, beer, rapeseed oil, canned fruits and vegetables, and other products,"" he mentioned.China enterprises, including producers, retailers, equipment manufacturers and trade service providers, said they are looking for Belarus partners and are ready to import from the country.",SOURCE,ECONOMY,Picture description not found,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'Belarus': ('LOC', 19), 'Shanghai': ('LOC', 1), 'China': ('LOC', 15), 'Russia': ('LOC', 1), 'Ukraine': ('LOC', 1), 'Park': ('LOC', 1), 'Great Stone': ('LOC', 1), 'China International Import Expo': ('MISC', 1), 'VCGE': ('ORG', 1), 'Yuri Senko': ('PER', 4), 'Alla Lomakina': ('PER', 1)}"

463,German industrial production recovers after slump on Russia-Ukraine conflict,Xinhua,2022-06-09,"Germany industrial production recovered slightly in April following a slump caused by the Russia-Ukraine conflict, according to preliminary figures released on Wednesday by the Federal Statistical Office (Destatis).After falling 3.7 percent month-on-month in March -- the sharpest drop since the start of COVID-19 pandemic -- industrial production rose by 0.7 percent in April.However, production levels were still dampened by the conflict as Germany was ""disproportionately affected by the trade sanctions against Russia,"" the Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action said in a statement.The value of incoming orders for industry in Germany continued to be higher than that of sales. ""The excess demand is likely to be due to the continuing acute shortage of intermediate products,"" Destatis noted. Many companies were still facing problems filling new orders as a result.According to the Munich-based ifo Institute, more than three out of four Germany companies complained of bottlenecks or problems in the procurement of intermediate products and raw materials in May.Industrial output in EU also declined after the start of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, albeit less sharply than in Germany.

For people around the world, the conflict, together with the other crises, is threatening to unleash ""an unprecedented wave of hunger and destitution, leaving social and economic chaos in its wake,"" he said at the launch of a second report by the Global Crisis Response Group on Food, Energy and Finance over the Ukraine conflict.""Today's report makes clear that the war's impact on food security, energy and finance is systemic, severe, and speeding up. It is amplifying the consequences of the many other crises the world faces: climate, COVID-19, and the severe global inequalities in the resources available for the recovery from the pandemic,"" said Guterres.He warned that while vulnerable people and vulnerable countries are being hit hard, no country or community will be left untouched by this cost-of-living crisis.Food prices are at near-record highs. Fertilizer prices have more than doubled, sounding an alarm everywhere. Without fertilizers, shortages will spread from corn and wheat to all staple crops, including rice, with a devastating impact on billions of people in Asia and South US, he said. ""This year's food crisis is about lack of access. Next year's could be about lack of food.""Record high energy prices are also triggering blackouts and fuel shortages in all parts of the world, especially in Africa. And the financial squeeze continues on many developing countries - on top of the risk of debt default and economic collapse because of COVID-19, the inequality of the recovery, and the climate crisis, he noted.Worldwide, three out of five workers are earning less than before the pandemic. Now, both countries and individuals have no hope of balancing their budgets. Instead, families everywhere are being forced into impossible decisions: whether to shut down their businesses, sell their livestock, or take their children out of school. Women and girls are often the last to eat, and the first to miss meals as food shortages spread, he said.Guterres called for a political solution to the Ukraine crisis in line with international law and the UN Charter.Until that happens, he called for immediate action on two fronts: to bring stability to global food and energy markets, to make resources available immediately to help the poorest countries.Xinhua",WORLD,EYE ON WORLD ,"UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres views war destruction at the Irpinsky Lipky residential complex on April 28, 2022 in Irpin, Ukraine.

465,China’s imports of bulk commodities slump in first five months but prices go up: customs,Global Times,2022-06-09,"China's imports of bulk commodities from January to May dropped, while witness a significant price rise, newly released data from the General Administration of Customs (GAC) showed on Thursday. In the first five months of 2022, China imported 95.96 million tons of coal, a year-on-year decrease of 13.6 percent while import prices surged to 1,018.2yuan ($152.38) per ton, up 105.3 percent. And, 44.91 million tons of natural gas was imported, dropping 9.3 percent while prices jumping 70.3 percent. Meanwhile, a total of 217 million tons of crude oil was imported, down 1.7 percent compared with the same period of 2021, while the price per ton topped 4,463 yuan, or rising 55.6 percent. The import volume for soybeans decreased 0.4 percent to 38.04 million tons with the average price surging 23.3 percent to 4,063.9 yuan per ton.Analysts noted that the commodities' price surge is primarily impacted by the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict.For instance, the price rise in crude oil is a direct result of the accumulated operational cost from each procedure in the supply chain such as labor cost and logistical cost, Wang Guoqing, research director at Beijing Lange Steel Information Research Center, told the Global Times on Thursday.  As for the reduction of coal imports, Wang noted that the impact from the international market such as the restrictions on Australia coal imports affected import volume. In response to the soaring commodities prices, Wang added that the country has been implementing measures to stabilize the market, while working on exploring more resources and expanding import channels. Taking crude oil for instance, China will explore more overseas resources while effectively utilizing domestic oil fields. The surge in raw material prices is a global issue faced by enterprises across the world, domestic media outlet yicai.com reported, citing Liang Ming, a senior official from the China Academy of International Trade and Economic Cooperation. The National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), China's top economic planner, said in May that it would work on ensuring supply and price stability for bulk commodities by guiding the domestic coal price to fluctuate within a reasonable range to stabilize electricity prices.Meanwhile, the NDRC said it will focus on mineral products to ensure supply and stable prices, while increasing domestic exploration and development of iron ore and speed up the construction of mineral bases to enhance the domestic resource security capacity. Global Times",SOURCE,ECONOMY,"An oil tanker is being unloaded at a terminal in Yantai, East China's Shandong Province on May 23, 2022.

466,Why did Jaishankar’s speech suddenly become popular in China?,Shi Lancha and Chen Anlan,2022-06-09,"While speaking on June 3 at the Globsec 2022 Forum in Bratislava, Slovakia, India's External Affairs Minister Dr S. Jaishankar came down heavily on EU—not only did he refute the criticism against India's purchase of Russia oil, but also insisted that India could well manage its foreign policy on its own, refusing to act according to any pressures imposed on it. Jaishankar argued that the world cannot be as ""Euro-centric"" as it was in the past. Soon, his tough albeit witty words generated a significant fan following even among China netizens and media. And here is why:Jaishankar was indignant for a good reason. The session was themed ""Taking Friendship to the Next Level: Allies in the Indo-Pacific Region,"" but it ironically spent all 28 minutes talking down to and criticizing India. The interviewer acted in a condescending manner, and sought to push around India on issues concerning Russia and China, than valuing India on its own merits.The interviewer first grilled Jaishankar on India's increased oil imports from Russia. The latter fought back saying that if EU could buy Russia oil so could India, alluding to West's hypocrisy. When India was told off for its moral ambiguity, Jaishankar fought back with down-to-earth pragmatism. He rightfully turned an India-versus-EU argument into a classic North-versus-South one. By speaking out on behalf of the more economically vulnerable developing countries, Jaishankar groomed India as the champion of the Global South which underwrote free flows of affordable oil and wheat. India's plain pragmatism contrasted sharply against high-sounding but empty West rhetoric. The West's hypocrisy was even more evident when China was concerned. The interviewer pushed India hard to view the Ukraine crisis through the prism of the China-India border dispute. However, Jaishankar went so far as to complain that EU must ""grow out of the mindset that EU's problems are the world's problems, but the world's problems are not EU's problems."" Here, he showed a great sense of confidence—the China-India dispute not only predated the Ukraine crisis, but also had been better managed than the latter. So, it was EU that should be given a lecture on crisis management. When Jaishankar was pressed to make the either-or choice between China and Russia on one hand, EU and the US on the other, he maneuvered. He first refused the construct imposed on India and argued that India, as the fifth or the sixth largest economy in the world with one-fifth of the world's population, was perfectly entitled to make its own choices on the balance of values and interests. Having said this, he then suggested that, as a democracy, a market economy, a pluralistic society, India had somehow made its choice already, even if in implicit ways. India as the other emerging Asia giant which has a land border dispute with China, was talked much in the West as an indispensable component of the Indo-Pacific Strategy for checking Beijing. However, to Jaishankar and his fellow Indians' much chagrin, the West has hardly lived up to their lip service and has been reluctant to treat India accordingly. Instead of courting India with due respect and real concessions, the West was more ready to press India to bear the brunt of the conflicts, be it in Asia or in EU. India should be respected as much as it is needed by the West. However, as shown above, the much-expected strategic confluence did not lead to close coordination, but an embarrassing mismatch: There were gaps between India's overcharge and the West's underbid, between high-sounding bluffing and tightfisted settlement, and between self-proclaimed status and real capacity. After all, they all tried hard to convince, if not pressurize, the other party, by highlighting their own importance and morality. For example, while India would dress itself as the born leader of the Global South, the West quite openly scorned such, even though it was often the West which first fomented India's ego presumably for strategic purposes.For the West, the principal reason to attach more importance to India has been its growing value as a counterweight to China. In this way, as long as India would balance China strategically, how India perceived itself did not really matter. After all, India was still not perceived as a major player like China, Russia and US, so the West did not really care how New Delhi thought and what it wanted to do, but only how it fitted into the West's cause and served their interests accordingly. However, for India, it has gained importance as its economic and military clout continued to grow. That is why it so dearly longs for treatment in accordance with its own properties, rather than with the role assigned in reference to China. India hates the premise that its demands and interests appear to be deemed transactional.So, what's most significant and interesting about the Bratislava episode was that, Jaishankar — along with a mischievous smile at times — revealed the West's arrogance. Many China netizens saw in Jaishankar what they see in their own country. In a same vein, China was talked down to, cowed, pushed around, and denied the right to secure its own interests according to common sense and equality, simply because it has grown more economically prosperous and technologically advanced than what the West could tolerate. It was, perhaps, this sentiment that resonated so strongly between China and India. Shi Lancha is a South Asia expert.

467,"Spain's Repsol in talks to sell 25% of oil and gas unit to EIG, sources say",Reuters,2022-06-09,"EIG is in early discussions with Repsol to buy part of the Spanish company's oil and gas exploration and production business, three sources with knowledge of the matter told Reuters.The US fund is seeking to purchase up to 25 percent of Repsol's upstream business, the sources said, in a deal that would give the Spanish group cash for its plans to build clean energy capacity such as solar plants and wind farms.The sources did not give a value for any deal, but analysts have said the upstream business is worth between 14 billion and 18 billion euros ($15 billion and $COVID-19 billion), including debt.The companies began talks after EIG made an unsolicited offer, said the sources, who declined to be identified because the discussions were private. They said talks could take months and there was no guarantee a deal would be reached.A deal would give Repsol the funds to help achieve plans to more than double low-carbon power generation capacity by 2025 to 7.5 gigawatts. A gigawatt is roughly the output of one nuclear plant.""Selling a stake in the upstream business would allow Repsol to crystallize value at a high point in the cycle,"" a Redburn analyst told clients in a note, after the Russia-Ukraine conflict drove up oil and gas prices, boosting returns for producers.""For EIG to actually realize that value, we suspect there would have to be some form of commitment to run it for cash and distribute free cash flow to the shareholders. This enforced capital discipline would also be positive for Repsol shareholders in our view.""  Climate commitmentsLike other oil firms, Repsol's upstream division has a complex structure with more than 100 individual units, its 2021 annual report showed. To streamline operations, it has sold stakes in exploration businesses in several countries and sold its Russia assets to Gazprom Neft in January. US-based EIG specializes in private investments in energy and related infrastructure. It led a consortium that spent $12.4 billion on a 49 percent stake in pipelines owned by oil giant Saudi Aramco last year. Repsol told Spain's regulator in a statement it was analyzing various opportunities and proposals for its exploration and production unit and no decision had been taken.EIG declined to comment.Repsol was among the first global oil and gas producers to commit to ensuring that by 2050 its products emitted no more carbon than could be absorbed by natural sinks such as forests or artificial systems like carbon capture.The company has said it will spend more than one-third of the COVID-19.3 billion euros it plans to invest by 2025 on low-carbon projects such as renewable power, or on the production of hydrogen without creating planet-warming emissions.In oil and gas, it has pledged to prioritize less carbon-intensive projects that will be pumping for a shorter time.Repsol's main oil and gas production sites are in North US, Bolivia, Colombia, Venezuela, Trinidad and Tobago, Brazil and Libya. Its produces more natural gas than oil, and gas accounts for 70 percent of its proven reserves.Repsol's upstream business carries higher production costs than rivals, churning out lower revenues per barrel, but it has one of the industry's highest organic reserve replacement ratios, analysts said.The company expects to produce an average of 585,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2022.Reuters",SOURCE,COMPANIES,Photo: VCG,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'EIG': ('ORG', 5), 'Repsol': ('ORG', 8), 'Reuters': ('ORG', 1), 'Redburn': ('ORG', 1), 'Araco': ('ORG', 1), 'Spanish': ('MISC', 2), 'Saudi': ('MISC', 1), 'US': ('LOC', 2), 'Russia': ('LOC', 1), 'Ukraine': ('LOC', 1), 'Russiaazrom': ('LOC', 1), 'Spain': ('LOC', 1)}"
468,"Weapons sent by US and NATO may fall into dark net and even to terrorists, leading widespread and unbearable cost",Fan Lingzhi and Lin Xiaoy,2022-06-09,"Heartless terrorists turned dreadful mercenaries, weapons scattered in a chaotic battlefield… These disturbing signs showed that a big, horrible disaster is sprawling in the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Executive Director of Europol Catherine De Bolle told Germany media in late May that they were very concerned that the military equipment the West is sending to Ukraine will end up on the black market and in the hands of terrorists and criminals. Previous reports show that the Russia Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) found the US was stepping up its efforts to recruit members of international terrorist groups, including extremist organizations, as mercenaries to fight in Ukraine and take part in sabotage operations against Russia forces.After US President Joe Biden formally signed the $40 billion aid package to Ukraine, this worry became more pressing. Can the flow of weapons from NATO and the US to Ukraine be monitored? Is it only a matter of time before terrorist groups take hold of those weapons? Who is laughing behind EU's worried back?Several experts told the Global Times that it is difficult to control the flow of weapons on the battlefield. They noted that not only EU, which has been deprived of its security autonomy by the US and NATO, but also the third world countries, will suffer the costs. Those who prefer to live by the sword will fall by the sword. While the military-industrial complex profiteers, it is only a matter of time before this backfires, experts noted.

We know this from many other instances of conflict. Criminals are even now, as we speak, focusing on them,"" said Stock, stressing that the illegal weapons flowing into the criminal market will create a challenge. Several days ago, De Bolle expressed the same concern in an interview with the Germany newspaper Die Welt am Sonntag. She said the arms delivered from the EU to Ukraine could easily fall into the hands of criminals which would imperil the internal security landscape of the EU. Along with weapons are bloodthirsty criminals. According to the SVR, in April about 60 ISIS militants, aged 20 to 25, were released from prisons controlled by Syrian Kurds with the intervention of US intelligence services. They were ""transferred to the US military base of Al-Tanf, located in Syria near the border with Jordan and Iraq, for combat training with the aim of a subsequent deployment to Ukraine,"" according to a statement from the SVR.Analysts pointed out that the frantic fascist ""dream"" of killing is the same on both sides of the Atlantic. The far-right ""white supremacists"" in the US now also threaten ordinary people's lives. The recent spate of mass shootings in the US has made the possible influx of illegal weapons from Ukraine more even frightening. What would it look like, on both sides of the Atlantic, if a large amount of unregulated weapons flows from Ukraine to extremists around the world? Regardless of this question, it seems that the US does not care. On May 21, during his visit to South Korea, Joe Biden signed into law a $40 billion aid package for Ukraine. Previously, the US Senate and House of Representatives had quickly passed the bill with unusual ""efficiency.""

Photo: VCGA heavy price to bearWhat weapons have the US and other NATO countries provided since the Russia-Ukraine conflict erupted? A June 5 report by Al Jazeera titled ""Weapons to Ukraine: Which countries have sent what?"" said that US aid accounts for a significant portion, including 1,400 Stinger anti-aircraft systems, 5,000 Javelin anti-tank missiles, several thousand rifles with ammunition, and a range of other equipment.However, some of the West weapons sent as aid to Ukraine are being sold on the dark net. ASB Military News reported on June 2 that some of the arms the US and NATO donated are being sold to buyers in the Middle East and North Africa. According to the Pentagon's 2021 budget, each Javelin missile costs $178,000. However, these missiles are now listed for sale on the dark net for just $30,000, ASB Military News revealed.""Many people are taking these weapons and selling them to terrorist organizations on the black market. As a result, these weapons will be used in the future to kill people in EU and other places,"" US journalist John Mark Dougan confirmed the news in an interview with the Global Times, saying it is almost impossible to monitor the circulation of these weapons. Dougan is a former US Marine who traveled to Ukraine as a reporter after the conflict broke out. ""The management of weapons on the Russia-Ukraine battlefield is in a very chaotic state and the whereabouts of these weapons cannot be traced at all,"" Li Wei, an expert on national security at the China Institute of Contemporary International Relations, told the Global Times.Li pointed out that the Russia army, as the regular army, has a set of weapons management processes. On the side of the Ukraine army, the situation is more complicated. In addition to the regular army, there is the Azov Battalion and other militia organizations. ""At the beginning of the conflict, some weapons were even distributed to civilians,"" he said.Li noted that in the process of delivering aid, West countries just handed them over to the Ukraine government, but as these weapons are funneled into the conflict and their final destination, there lacks the ability and interest to monitor the situation.Where might these weapons go in the future?Akila al-Taya, an Iraqi security expert, recently told Russia news agency Sputnik that US weapons currently supplied to Ukraine are likely to be smuggled to extremists inside or outside Ukraine, as well as to terrorist groups, including the Islamic State, to arm them or create new organizations under other names. ""If these weapons are in the hands of terrorist organizations and criminal gangs, this could strengthen EU separatism and spark internal conflict. EU would be held accountable for US military actions and its own mistakes,"" He Zhigao, a research fellow with the Institute of EU Studies at the China Academy of Social Sciences (CASS), told the Global Times.He noted that the influx of refugees after the Ukraine crisis has raised the possibility of terrorist attacks, adding that ""the overlap of the refugee crisis, the influx of weapons, and the threat of terrorism is a scenario that EU is extremely unhappy to foresee."" ""These episodes of chaos prove that the autonomy of EU's security has obviously been lost during the Russia-Ukraine conflict,"" Li told the Global Times. Looking back, whenever EU has tried to achieve security autonomy, the US has caused trouble to block the process, with NATO as a key culprit.""Russia tried to improve relations with EU after the collapse of the Soviet Union, but in the US' view, such an improvement could be a threat to its global hegemony,"" Li said, noting that ""the US wanted to re-awaken 'Russophobia' in EU, and the conflict between Russia and Ukraine has made the US' plan perfectly realized.""""For EU, it is necessary to define and maintain its core interests more clearly. If they blindly follow the pace of the US, their security autonomy will be a fantasy, let alone being an independent actor with global influence,"" Li said.He believes that EU should strengthen strategic autonomy and transfer its security concepts. EU should also support the role of the UN in the field of conventional arms control with major powers including China, He said.Doomed to be backlashedIn addition to the deepening anxiety in EU, frequent gun violence has hit the US recently. At least 13 mass shootings occurred in the US over the last weekend, resulting in 16 deaths and more than 70 injured. So far, there have been 246 mass shootings in the US this year, according to a report by CNN on June 6.Scattering guns in foreign countries while being unable to ban guns domestically, the US' practice at home and abroad seems to be linked by a ""dark line.""""The dark line shows that some people want to see the consequences of the proliferation of guns,"" Zhang Yifei, an assistant research fellow with the Institute of US Studies of the CASS, told the Global Times, highlighting that by ""selling guns globally and not banning guns at home, the biggest winner would be the military-industrial complex of the US.""The US political magazine ""Jacobin"" recently published an article indicating that it is difficult to say how much of the $40 billion in US aid will ultimately go directly to Ukraine. But one thing is clear. For arms manufacturers, what is happening in Ukraine is a ""bonanza.""Meanwhile, sending a mixed bag of mercenaries into the battlefield seems like the last piece of the puzzle to fully implement the whole plan.Just as De Bolle assessed, ""people who are going to fight in Ukraine do not represent a homogeneous group but rather adhere to different ideologies.""Zhang said that the biggest hidden danger of US' approach is that those who hold dollars and US weapons must be pro-US. ""Those who gather with a common interest will naturally disperse when their interests are exhausted. Therefore, backlash will be a sure outcome for the US,"" he said.""The US is ready to use any means to achieve its geopolitical goals, not excluding sponsoring international terrorist groups,"" the SVR said.The Global Times found that the definition of terrorist support in the UN's International Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism, almost ""fits perfectly"" with the behavior displayed by the US, and ironically, the US is also party to the convention.""As a hegemonic country, the US often defines 'terrorism' unilaterally,"" Li said, noting that ""in the eyes of the US, whether it is 'supporting terrorism' is not defined by the UN, but only by the US' standards.""But Al Qaeda, which was responsible for the 9/11 attacks, was created with US funding. Therefore, the US is a country that supports terrorists, Li concluded.",IN-DEPTH,IN-DEPTH,"Ukrainian servicemen unload a Boeing 747-412 plane with the FGM-148 Javelin, anti-tank missiles provided by US to Ukraine as part of a military support, at Kiev's airport Boryspil on February 11, 2022.

469,"Hyping ‘China threat’ in Shangri-La Dialogue, Kishida will send aftershocks of European geopolitical earthquake to Asia",Global Times,2022-06-09,"Japan Prime Minister Fumio Kishida is scheduled to deliver a keynote speech at the Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore on Friday. Before he does it, Japan media outlets have already sent a signal - Kishida has come with ill intentions. According to Japan media, Kishida will stress the significance of bolstering maritime security cooperation, oppose unilateral changes to the status quo by force, no matter where they occur, including the Diaoyu Islands and the Taiwan Straits, as well as unveil Tokyo's plans to further boost the country's defense budget and military capabilities. If that is the case, Kishida's role in this year's Shangri-La Dialogue cannot be more evident - fanning the flames on the platform, misleading the agenda, making excuses for its future increase of military spending and coordinating with the US to expand the latter's gang in the region under the framework of the ""Indo-Pacific Strategy."" It is not surprising if Kishida will raise the issues in his speech, as he has made clear his stance multiple times in the past. In May, during UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson's Japan tour, Kishida warned that ""Ukraine might be tomorrow's East Asia."" This is blatant fabrication and dissemination of the fake urgency - a potential war may soon break out in Asia - to terrify regional countries and force them to take sides. It seems that Kishida does not mind sending more aftershocks of the ongoing EU geopolitical earthquake to Asia in his speech during the Shangri-La Dialogue, Asia's defense summit.The Diaoyu Islands issue and the Taiwan question are fundamentally different from the Ukraine crisis. The former two are about China's core interests and the Taiwan question is China's domestic affairs. When a Japan prime minister makes such a comparison, he is either an amateur in diplomacy, or playing dumb, Song Zhongping, a China military expert and TV commentator, told Global Times. Kishida's words do not represent just himself, but the Liberal Democratic Party, which has always been pursuing to turn Japan into a normal country again and to shake off the restrictions imposed by the Japan pacifist constitution. By hyping the so-called regional threat, Tokyo will have more excuses to further increase its military budget and send troops overseas, forging its Self-Defense Force as an offensive army. Japan wishes to be the big boss in the Asia-Pacific region again and it feels both uncomfortable and scared when facing China's rise, as it is aware that Japan alone is not capable of dealing with China. Thus, Tokyo chose to rely on US, Song said. To keep a hold on US support and endorsement, Japan puts its identity and responsibilities as an Asia power behind its back. When the US promotes its ""Indo-Pacific Strategy,"" Japan proactively cooperates by stirring up trouble and confrontation in the region.On the other hand, the US has been taking advantage of Japan. Take the Shangri-La Dialogue. It is more of a platform to lead the regional agenda rather than simply a stage for communication. It is called Asia's defense summit, but does it really represent the will of the Asia countries? The dialogue is organized by the International Institute for Strategic Studies, a UK-based think tank. The topics and themes are naturally led by certain West countries. And from past experience, more divergences and unstable factors in the region, rather than regional countries' common interests, were raised on the platform, Lü Yaodong, a research fellow at China Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times. Against the current geopolitical backdrop, inviting Kishida as the keynote speaker at the Shangri-La Dialogue opening ceremony shows what signal the US-led West wants to deliver on the multilateral occasion.Yet when cooperating with the US strategy, Japan may need to sober up that ""US First"" is not and will never be Japan first. At any critical juncture, US will not hesitate to abandon Tokyo for the US' own interests, just like how it abandoned Afghanistan and Syria. Be it the Diaoyu Islands issue or the Taiwan question, Japan's and the US' calculations differ. The US-Japan Security Treaty will never be Japan's life-saving straw, as that is not in line with the nature of ""US First,"" Song told Global Times. Japan is a small country in size, with no strategic depth. If it ever dares to launch a military attack overseas, there is no way it can dodge revenge. Provoking other countries and keeping such warmongering behavior may eventually turn Japan into a battlefield again, Song noted.",OPINION,OBSERVER,Fumio Kishida.

470,China's coal supply stretched as economy rapidly recovers,GT staff reporters,2022-06-09,"With the China economy witnessing a quick recovery after the recent Omicron flare-up is controlled and the society's electricity consumption ramps up, energy demand is surging. Experts and industry players said that the overall energy situation is safe as the country has accelerated efforts to secure supplies despite global uncertainties.Coke producers in Shandong, Shanxi and Hebei provinces raised the price of coke by 100 yuan ($15) per ton on Tuesday, initiating a new round of price rises for metallurgical coal. Shares of related companies rose by about 1.2 percent on Thursday, with Zhengzhou Coal & Electric Co and JXIC Anyuan Coal Industry Group hitting the daily limit. The sector has on average gained about 30 percent since April 26.""As the epidemic has been brought under control, coal demand on the market has rapidly resumed,"" a marketing representative of a coal processing company based in China's Anhui Province told the Global Times on Thursday. The latest price rise is deemed a ""correction"" of the market, the representative said. Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Tuesday that his country planned to suspend natural gas and coal exports to give priority to domestic energy supply, since Ukraine may face ""the most difficult winter,"" according to media reports.Indonesia, the world's largest coal exporter imposed a one-month export ban on thermal coal on January 1. Though the ban has been lifted, market observers believe export restrictions may return.The price of Newcastle coal futures stood at $395.4 per ton on Thursday. The price was only about $150 at the start of the year, according to data tracking platform Trading Economics.""We import about 200,000 tons of coke every year. If the prices in the international market stay high, we will turn to domestic suppliers after our inventory is used up,"" a marketing representative said, stressing that domestic supply would be sufficient given coal producers have been expanding their production capacity.China has been ramping up efforts to ensure domestic energy supplies. In April, the nation announced plans to increase coal production capacity by 300 million tons this year, as energy will provide primary support for China's economic and social development. Enterprises above the designated size in China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region produced 119.7 million tons of coal from January to April, up 29 percent year-on-year, regional data showed.Different departments have been preparing to stabilize the energy market. State Grid Corp of China, which supplies electricity to over 1.1 billion people across the country, has geared up for the summer peak consumption season. During a recent meeting, the company vowed to implement 30 key steps to ensure power supply, including strengthening the maintenance of ultra-high voltage transmission lines.  China Railway delivered 110 million tons of thermal coal in May, up 7 percent year-on-year.""The overall energy supply this year won't be a big problem,"" Lin Boqiang, director of the China Center for Energy Economics Research at Xiamen University, told the Global Times on Thursday.Compared with last year when factories saw surging overseas orders, industrial power consumption is lower this year. Also, relevant authorities have rolled out measures to ensure power supplies after shortages happened in some provinces last year, including stabilizing coal prices, Lin said.But challenges remain as the supply-demand balance for coal will remain tight, and prices are expected to stay high, given surging prices in overseas markets. Also, domestic production capacity expansion takes time, he added.",SOURCE,ECONOMY,"A vessel docks at Huanghua port, North China's Hebei Province to load coal in December 2021.

471,China-Russia trade up 28.9% in Jan-May; further growth expected,Global Times,2022-06-09," China's trade with Russia saw faster growth in the first five months of 2022, according to China customs data on Thursday, as Russia accelerated the shift of its supply chain to Asia amid US-led West economic sanctions.Experts expect that China-Russia trade could surpass $150 billion this year, as both sides aim to expand their economic and trade cooperation in the spirit of mutual benefit.According to data released by China's General Administration of Customs, China-Russia bilateral trade stood at $65.81 billion in the first five months, up 28.9 percent on a yearly basis. The growth rate accelerated from 25.9 percent seen in the January-April period.In the first five months, China's imports from Russia in US dollar terms grew 46.5 percent from a year earlier, accelerating from 37.8 percent in the first four months. But export growth fell from 11.3 percent in the first four months to 7.2 percent.Experts noted that the trade growth comes as Russia accelerates the shift of its economic pivot to Asia amid escalating sanctions from the West.Russia's ""turn to the East"" has been underway for around a decade and accelerated due to the West sanctions, Li Xin, director of the Institute for Eurasian Studies at the Shanghai University of Political Science and Law, told the Global Times on Thursday.Faced with West sanctions, Russia has turned to the Asia-Pacific region, in this process, China might be its main target due to China's massive market, Li said, noting that the products traded between China and Russia have become increasingly diverse and complementary.Russia is the world's largest oil exporter, while China is quite advanced in terms of mechanical and electrical products with outstanding manufacturing strength. In 2021, Russia remained China's top source of energy imports, which totaled 334.3 billion yuan ($50 billion), an increase of 47.4 percent, accounting for 65.3 percent of China's total imports from Russia.Trade of mechanical and electrical products totaled $43.4 billion in 2021, rising by 40.7 percent year-on-year, with China's automobiles, auto parts and mobile phones being popular among Russia consumers.In recent years, China-Russia trade has been expanding from energy and raw material imports to other food and agricultural products like grain, soybeans, wheat and dairy items, Li said.Data showed that China's mine product imports from Russia hit $24.14 billion from January to April, while meat imports hit $147.95 million.China-Russia trade will show a relatively large increase despite the Ukraine crisis and COVID-19 outbreaks this year, boosted by the complementary needs of the economies, experts said.Li predicted that China-Russia trade will maintain robust growth this year and could surge above $150 billion. In 2021, bilateral trade stood at $146.87 billion, a record high.China has been Russia's top trading partner for 12 consecutive years and the two nations have set a goal of reaching $200 billion in trade by 2024. China's Foreign Ministry has reiterated that China will continue to conduct normal trade cooperation with Russia, while remaining firmly opposed to unilateral sanctions that have no basis in international law. ""Reality has shown that sanctions are not the right solution to the Ukraine crisis. The massive, indiscriminate sanctions imposed by a few countries on Russia have not helped the situation deescalate at all. On the contrary, EU and the world have paid a heavy price for these sanctions,"" Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian told a regular briefing on Monday.",SOURCE,ECONOMY,"The photo taken on February 23, 2020 shows the Guangzhou Nansha Port.

472,"Wang Yi meets with Kazakh president, stresses vigilance against external forces",Yu Xi and Zhang Changyue,2022-06-07," China  on Tuesday met with Kazakh President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev in Kazakhstan's capital Nur-Sultan, during which he stressed the importance of vigilance to external forces attempting to involve regional countries in major-power conflicts and to coerce countries to take sides.The year 2022 marks the 30th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic ties between China and Kazakhstan. Wang said that as friendly neighbors and permanent comprehensive strategic partners, China firmly supports Kazakhstan in pursuing a development path suited to its own national conditions and believes Kazakhstan will achieve lasting peace and prosperity.Wang said the two countries are deeply concerned about the serious negative spillover impact of the Ukraine crisis. He noted that China hopes Central Asia countries can stay focused and remove external interference, strengthen coordination and cooperate to safeguard regional peace and stability. ""China has never sought geopolitical interests in Central Asia, and we will never allow external forces to disrupt the region,"" Wang said. Tokayev appreciated China's fair position and would like to maintain close communication with China. He also advocated resolving international disputes through peaceful means.External forces mainly refer to US-led forces that aim to force Central Asia nations to take sides, while Central Asia nations wish to preserve an independent status with no interference from other countries on their sovereignty and diplomacy, Zhu Yongbiao, director of the Center for Afghanistan Studies in Lanzhou University, told the Global Times on Tuesday.External forces may also include the forces of terrorism and extremism, of which the impact to Central Asia nations has been increasing in recent years, Zhu added. Pursuing a balanced diplomacy between great powers suits the national interest of Kazakhstan and it has been doing quite well even under in the Ukraine crisis and its large-scaled reform on its domestic political system. The US may take chances to break the balanced diplomacy and even create chaos within Kazakhstan, Zhu noted. Wang also appreciated Kazakhstan's role in preparing for the third China+Central Asia (C+C5) foreign ministers' meeting and noted that China is willing to strengthen solidarity and cooperation with Central Asia neighbors.Facing the complex international and regional security situations, China is willing to strengthen exchanges and cooperation with member states of the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO) and take effective measures to maintain regional peace and stability together, Li Zhanshu, chairman of the National People's Congress (NPC) Standing Committee made the remarks on Monday in a speech delivered via video link at the Parliamentary Assembly of the CSTO.This year marks the 30th anniversary of the signing of the Collective Security Treaty and the 20th anniversary of the CSTO.",CHINA,DIPLOMACY,State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'China': ('LOC', 10), 'Kazakhstan': ('LOC', 7), 'Nur - Sultan': ('LOC', 1), 'Ukraine': ('LOC', 2), 'Central Asia': ('LOC', 7), 'Kazakh': ('MISC', 1), 'US': ('MISC', 2), 'Treaty': ('MISC', 1), 'Kassym - Jomart Tokayev': ('PER', 2), 'Wang': ('PER', 4), 'Zhu Yongbiao': ('PER', 3), 'Center for Afghanistan Studies': ('ORG', 1), 'Lanzhou University': ('ORG', 1), 'Global Times': ('ORG', 1), 'Central': ('ORG', 2), 'C': ('ORG', 2), 'F': ('ORG', 1), 'Organization': ('ORG', 1), 'CSTO': ('ORG', 2), 'Li Zhanshu': ('ORG', 1), 'National People': ('ORG', 1), 'Congress': ('ORG', 1), 'NPC': ('ORG', 1), 'Committee': ('ORG', 1), 'Assembly': ('ORG', 1)}"
473,Japan needs a head blow to wake up: Global Times editorial,Global Times,2022-06-08,"After Japan media reported that the Japan government has been considering having an incumbent official with Japan Ministry of Defense stationed in Taiwan island for the first time beginning this summer, the Japan government has not responded, and the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) authority has also been unusually low-key. Both of them appear to have a hidden agenda. Japan needs to explain its recent moves concerning Taiwan, including this news, to China.On Tuesday, Yang Jiechi, a member of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee and Director of the Office of the Central Commission for Foreign Affairs, spoke on the phone with the Secretary-General of Japan's National Security Secretariat Akiba Takeo.  Yang said that ""At present, old and new issues are intertwined in China-Japan relations, and difficulties and challenges cannot be ignored."" These lines were clearly targeted. Japan's escalating aggression and provocation toward the Taiwan question has become an unavoidable major risk for China-Japan relations.If Japan sends an active-duty defense official to Taiwan, it will in fact break the post-war framework of Japan's relations with Taiwan, and China will react strongly. According to the China version of Kyodo News on Monday, the Japan Defense Ministry has decided to create a new unified commander post and a unified commander department for the land, maritime and air Self-Defense Forces, which is also seen as a move to ""cope with China."" Considering former Japan prime minister Shinzo Abe's public statements that ""a Taiwan emergency is a Japan emergency"" and that ""Japan, the US, and other allies must create a situation that forces China to give up seizing Taiwan by force,"" it can be seen that the rhetoric of Japan's right-wing former politician on the Taiwan question is gradually reflected in the current Japan government's policy toward Taiwan island. Through the public opinion mobilization of Japan right-wing politicians, an extremely dangerous ""consensus"" is shaping and growing in Japan society, and its right-wing forces are also taking the opportunity to get rid of the checks and balances. Perhaps for Japan right-wing forces, now is a rare ""window,"" or even ""the last chance,"" for Japan to seek relaxation in its military restrictions and reshape Japan's status in Asia. Therefore manipulating the Taiwan question has become more urgent than before, moving from tentative actions to almost semi-open activities, sometimes even abandoning tactical ""hiding"" or ""ambiguity."" The right-wing forces try to grab every ""opportunity"" and Russia-Ukraine conflict is no exception. According to Japan media, Japan and China have been in ""opposing camps"" in the Russia-Ukraine conflict and Japan decided to take a step forward on the Taiwan question without thinking too much about China's feelings. This is already quite revealing.Japan is literally doing something that threatens China's core national interests, and China will not remain indifferent. We must remind Japan of what this step means. Taiwan question is China's internal affair. If an outsider wants to step in, we will ""break its leg."" Japan is even acting more aggressively than the US in its involvement in the Taiwan question, which may or may not stem entirely from US's encouragement. In fact, Japan's militarism, which has been sealed for half a century, is rising. It's necessary for Asia-Pacific powers to give Japan a blow to the head, so that it comes to its senses. In the end, this is good for Japan. It should be noted that Japan is responsible for its historical crimes in Asia. The very existence of the Taiwan question is related to the ""disastrous seeds"" planted by Japan militarism, but what Japan right-wing politicians are promoting today is an act that seriously fuels the arrogance of the ""Taiwan independence"" secessionist forces. No matter how cleverly they speak, right and wrong cannot be reversed.

Photo: VCGChina's wheat harvest is on track to finish on schedule, with over 50 percent already harvested, the state broadcaster CCTV reported. A total of 167 million mu (11.13 million hectares) of wheat across the country had been harvested as of Tuesday, two days ahead of previous years, due to increased efficiency. In North China's Hebei and China's Shandong provinces, agricultural specialists and harvesting machines were deployed to deal with natural disasters and improve farm efficiency. China's central government has allocated 222.483 billion yuan ($33.27 billion) of funds targeting agricultural development in 2022, 12.18 billion yuan more than last year, and an extra 21.2 billion yuan of subsidies was granted for purchasing farming machinery. Around 80 percent of the grain in Southwest China has been harvested, while harvesting of grain in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River has started, the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs said.China has raised the national minimum purchase price of wheat to 115 yuan per 50 kilograms, up 2 yuan year-on-year, according to data from the National Food and Strategic Reserves Administration.The state-owned grain enterprise Sinograin is preparing to purchase harvested new grain, making ready warehouses with a capacity for more than 40 million tons of grain to ensure the revenue of farmers. China is expected to achieve a bumper crop of summer grain despite COVID-19 resurgence, extreme warm weather pattern this year, and the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, two major grain exporters. Some countries such as India and Afghanistan have announced they'll suspend their wheat exports to avoid domestic food shortages. According to data from the General Administration of Customs, China's imports of wheat dropped 22.4 percent year-on-year in April to 700,000 tons.

476,China-EU economic ties on brink of an ideological confrontation trap,Ding Gang,2022-06-08,"A big challenge facing China and the EU is that bilateral economic and trade relations have come to the brink of an ideological confrontation trap. Unless the two sides make joint efforts, meet each other halfway, show enough courage and carry out concrete actions to stabilize bilateral economic and trade ties, especially in terms of making progress on the resolution of investment, market and supply chain issues between the two, there is a risk of intensifying ""decoupling.""Since ""decoupling"" was triggered by the US-launched trade war with China in 2018, conflicts in China-EU economic and trade ties caused by differing ideologies have continued to increase.In recent years, US has focused on forming a ""value alliance"" against China, with particular emphasis on containing China in the fields of information technology and emerging technologies.In terms of ideology, the EU is aligned with the US as a natural ally. Some EU member states tend to cooperate with US more closely, be it proactively or passively. For example, they have drawn a clear-cut line between themselves and China tech giant Huawei's 5G technology due to so-called differences in security and political systems. The EU has also extended its arms trade embargos against China, citing political issues, to include high-tech sectors.Some EU politicians continued to pile up pressure on EU companies by hyping up issues such as human rights in Xinjiang. As a result, the mistrust between China and the EU has continued to rise. China is increasingly concerned that the EU will mix human rights, Hong Kong and Xinjiang affairs with economic and trade issues. EU, on the other hand, is very worried about that China will take retaliatory moves against its companies. In addition, the adjustment of China's domestic economic policy and the ""broken chain"" effects during COVID-19 pandemic also increased concerns about future uncertainties.Germany's new government signed a coalition agreement in December 2021. The current administration now stresses on reducing strategic dependence in its China policy.  With the continuation of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, EU companies will have to reconsider their future investments in China, their market expansion, the prospect of industrial chain dependence, and look for alternative places for their production against the backdrop of intensified ideological confrontation. China companies and exporters will also have to consider the impact of this trend on their development in EU.A ""decoupling"" situation, if it happens, in China-EU economic and trade relations, will be detrimental to both sides. Take employment, the interdependence between the two is obvious to see. In April, the EU Think-Tank Network on China published its eighth research report on EU's economic dependence on China. Two sets of data in the report are telling. A total of 900,000 jobs in Germany are in one way or another related to business with China, accounting for 2 percent of the Germany workforce, while Germany companies directly employ more than 1 million staff in China, jobs created by their China suppliers and partners not included. China-Germany interdependence reflects the degree of China-EU interdependence.That being said, China and the EU need to view their economic and trade issues with a broader attitude, and to minimize the impact of ideological conflicts on the development of their economic and trade relations.The Russia-Ukraine conflict in EU has cemented the foundations of the EU's value alliance. But EU must not think that such a banner of values can better help its own enterprises and capital to enter the vast Asia market, including China. Considering that EU countries have a colonial past in Asia, EU's ideology promotion needs to be more restrained.In the fields of economy and trade, the interests of EU and the US are not the same, and they are competitive in many fields. If the US-led value alliance dominates the development of global finance and economy, it will be difficult for the EU to truly become a powerful pole in the world. Of course, in that case, China's development will also face more difficulties. China needs to put more emphasis on opposing hegemony and war, and maintaining world peace based on UN principles. The most important thing is to start the approval process of the Comprehensive Agreement on Investment as soon as possible through coordinated negotiations. At the same time, it is necessary to explore the possible ways to expand cooperation in non-sensitive technical fields, and to promote technology trade and market access of both sides through continuous bargaining as much as possible. The China side should coordinate with EU companies to deal with the business issues that EU companies are most concerned about in an earnest manner. Especially after the initial control of the epidemic, it is necessary for China to solve possible supply chain problems in the future according to EU's requirements as much as possible, and boost their faith in the China market.The economic and trade ties between China and the EU have not come easily. The two sides should avoid falling into an ideological confrontation, adopt a pragmatic attitude, and attach more attention to the actual benefits achieved through cooperation.The author is a senior editor with People's Daily, and currently a senior fellow with the Chongyang Institute for Financial Studies at Renmin University of China. dinggang@globaltimes.com.cn.

477,European Parliament’s latest report concerning China is politically biased: Chinese Mission to the EU,Global Times,2022-06-08,"The China Mission to the EU on Wednesday slammed a report adopted by the EU concerning issues related to China's Taiwan, Hong Kong, Macao and Xinjiang as well as China's position on Ukraine, saying it is based on ideological bias.On Tuesday, the EU Parliament at its plenary session adopted the report on the EU and the security challenges in the Indo-Pacific, claiming that China poses a threat to the EU's interests in the region, criticizing China's position on Ukraine, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Macao and Xinjiang-related issues, and calling for the EU to enhance the existing partnership with Taiwan island. The parliament's report, based on ideological bias, distorts China's policy and position, plays up the ""China threat"" ideology, denies China's legitimate right to safeguard its sovereignty and security, and grossly interferes with China's internal affairs. We express our strong disapproval of and firm opposition to it, the spokesperson of the China Mission to EU said in a statement issued on Wednesday.Asia-Pacific?is the most vibrant region in the world and serves as a pacesetter for peace and development. The key to success in the region is a mutually beneficial cooperation. China is committed to building and benefiting the Asia-Pacific region, the spokesperson noted.""We welcome positive and constructive participation of countries outside the region in Asia-Pacific cooperation. It needs to be emphasized that?ganging up, provoking confrontation and creating rivalry is doomed to failure,"" the spokesperson added.As to the Taiwan, Hong Kong, Macao and Xinjiang-related affairs, the spokesperson said that these are entirely China's internal affairs, which allow no foreign interference. The spokesperson noted that the One-China principle is a shared consensus of the international community and an established norm of international relations. It is the political foundation on which China established diplomatic ties and develops relations with the EU. Without this foundation, everything above will be shaky. No one should underestimate the strong resolve, determination and capability of the China government and the 1.4 billion China people in safeguarding national sovereignty and territorial integrity, the spokesperson said.The spokesperson reiterated that China's position on Ukraine has been consistent and clear, as it has assumed an objective and impartial position all along and reached independent judgment based on the merits of the facts. China has been working actively and playing a constructive role in promoting peace talks and preventing conflict and large-scale humanitarian crisis. Time will prove that China's position is responsible and withstands the test of history. Any disinformation that smears China's efforts, distorts China's intention, or creates rumors to discredit China is neither responsible nor ethical, the spokesperson said.The spokesperson urged the EU Parliament to get in the right frame of mind, respect the facts and view China's development and domestic and foreign policies objectively and rationally. It's important to respect the strong wish of Asia-Pacific countries for peace, development and cooperation, and do more to promote the healthy and stable development of China-EU relations and the stability and prosperity of the region.Powerful EU lawmakers are also pushing to designate alleged human rights abuses against Uygurs and other ethnic Muslims in Xinjiang as ""genocide"" in a resolution set to reach the EU Parliament this week, the China Morning Post reported on Tuesday.The effort is to follow the US in hyping the so-called genocide allegation in China's Xinjiang region following the ""unsupervised"" and ""open"" visit of the UN human rights chief to China, experts pointed out while warning that ""genocide"" is a term that should be defined in strict accordance with international laws, rather than used as a political tool, and most EU countries are aware of this. Global Times",CHINA,DIPLOMACY,Photo: A screenshot from the website of the Chinese Mission to the EU,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'China': ('LOC', 18), 'Taiwan': ('LOC', 4), 'Hong Kong': ('LOC', 3), 'Macao': ('LOC', 3), 'Xinjiang': ('LOC', 3), 'Ukraine': ('LOC', 3), 'Indo - Pacific': ('LOC', 4), 'Asia': ('LOC', 3), 'EU': ('ORG', 7), 'EU Parliament': ('ORG', 8), 'One': ('MISC', 1)}"

Since the beginning of the year, the drought emergency in Somalia has worsened dramatically and today we are looking at a looming disaster,"" he told reporters at UN Headquarters in New York via a video link.The situation is grim. Four consecutive rainy seasons have failed, creating the worst drought in Somalia in at least four decades. At the same time, food prices have soared, and humanitarian assistance remains out of reach for millions of Somalis as resources to meet their needs remain limited, he said in a statement.The UN believes that the drought has so far affected 7 million people, displacing over 805,000 from their homes.Recently, some areas received moderate, scattered rains. But these were not enough to alleviate the severe drought conditions. There is now a concrete risk that the next rainy season could also be below average, which would mark an unprecedented fifth consecutive failed rainy season, he warned.""Should these forecasts materialize, the situation will worsen further until mid-2023, at the earliest. Already, eight areas in Somalia are at increased risk of famine, particularly in the south of the country - in regions where insecurity and conflict make humanitarian access extremely challenging."" Some 7.1 million Somalis, close to 50 percent of the population, are facing crisis-level food insecurity or worse through at least September. Of these, 213,000 people will face catastrophic hunger and starvation, representing a 160 percent increase since April, he said.Women, children and the elderly have been particularly hard hit, constituting 82 percent of all people displaced by drought since January. An estimated 1.5 million children under the age of 5 face acute malnutrition, including 386,400 who are likely to be severely malnourished, he said.""Somalia is certainly heading toward a famine, if action is not taken now."" Somali families are increasingly unable to cope with the high food prices as local food has become scarce. Moreover, imported food prices have also reached record levels, in part because of supply chain impacts due to the crisis in Ukraine. In some parts of the country, food prices have risen by 140 to 160 percent.Before the Ukraine conflict, Somalia imported 85 percent of wheat from Ukraine and Russia, he said.Xinhua",WORLD,EYE ON WORLD ,"Photo taken on Aug. 20, 2020 shows the Security Council meeting on the situation in Somalia at the UN headquarters in New York.

479,"Japanese yen may fall further, risking safe haven status amid weaker economic growth: expert",GT staff reporters,2022-06-08," The Japan yen, as one of the major international currencies, has seen the largest depreciation this year amid US' fast paced interest rate hikes and growing geopolitical tensions. Given weak growth expectations for the world's third-largest economy, the depreciation trend may continue and the currency may lose its status as a safe haven asset, experts said Wednesday.The US dollar rose to a two-week high buoyed by rising US 10-year Treasury yields, pushing the Japan yen to a fresh 20-year low of 133.22 per dollar on Wednesday. The yen has dropped about 15 percent this year against the US dollar, Yahoo News revealed.One of the direct reasons for yen's sharp depreciation is the widening gap between the yen and the dollar, since the US Federal Reserve began to accelerate the pace of interest rate hikes, the Bank of Japan has stuck to its super-loose monetary policy as the economy continues to struggle with the impact of the coronavirus pandemic, Zhang Jifeng, a former vice director of the Institute of Japan Studies at the China Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times on Wednesday.""The risk clearly outweighs any possible benefit,"" Zhang said, noting that a falling yen, along with global inflation and the Russia-Ukraine conflict, hits Japan consumers hard as product prices soar while their salaries remain flat.According to a survey conducted by Japan credit research firm Teikoku Databank Ltd, more than 10,000 food items in Japan will experience price rise of an average 13 percent this year due to rising materials costs and the yen's rapid depreciation, Kyodo News reported.The survey found that 105 major food manufacturers had raised prices on more than 6,000 products by June, with price hikes planned for an additional 4,504 products starting from July.Fast Retailing, owner of Japan clothing brand Uniqlo, said on Tuesday that it would raise prices on some items this autumn. Prices for fleeced goods and down jackets in the fall and winter products will increase by 1,000 yen ($7.54), and the company is also increasing the use of recycled polyester in its fleece products to cut costs, Reuters reported.Despite the negative impacts, Japan's central bank has vowed to take an unwavering stance on its ultra-loose monetary policy on Monday, with Governor of the Bank of Japan Haruhiko Kuroda saying that the economy is still in the middle of recovering from the pandemic's impact.According to experts, the depreciation of the yen boosts the overseas profits of Japan multinationals, as well as the recovery of the country's once-thriving tourism industry - a major part of its economy.Shares of Japan's global big names gained on Tuesday, with Honda Motor and Nissan rallying 2.5 percent and 2.6 percent, respectively, while heavyweight SoftBank Group rose 0.7 percent.On the same day, Japan announced a greenlight for foreign tour groups from nearly 100 countries and regions including China starting from Friday, according to Japan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Foreign tourism arrivals to Japan plunged by more than 90 percent to 245,900 in 2020, from a record 31.9 million visitors in the previous year, almost erasing the inbound tourism economy worth of over 4.8 trillion yen ($36 billion) in 2019, according to Japan's Tourism Agency.Depreciation trend likelyHowever, given the weaker expectations for the Japan economy, experts forecast that the depreciation trend being experienced by the Japan yen may continue, causing turmoil in Asia's foreign exchange market while adversely affecting other countries' exports, Dong Dengxin, director of the Finance and Securities Institute of the Wuhan University of Science and Technology, told the Global Times.For example, South Korea companies that compete with their Japan peers in sectors such as automobiles and machinery may feel the pain from a weak yen, according to Dong.Zhang predicted that the Japan currency may weaken to 150 yen per dollar this year if the Russia-Ukraine conflict further deteriorates. ""The once-mighty currency may lose its status as a safe haven, and eventually lead to changes in the international financial system,"" he said.For a long time, the yen has been used as a safe-haven currency - a currency that investors take shelters in when markets are rough, but a plunge in the currency and gloomy prospect for Japan's economic restoration may reduce its attraction, Dong said, noting that many international investors may shift to the China yuan.While data released by Japan's Cabinet Office showed on Wednesday that the economy shrank an annualized 0.5 percent in the first quarter of 2022, slightly better than the preliminary reading of a 1 percent fall. The IMF in April cut Japan's economic growth forecast for 2022 to 2.4 percent from its earlier estimate of 3.3 percent.In contrast to a weaker yen, the China currency strengthened to a month-high of 6.64 per dollar during Tuesday morning session trading, supported by a stabilizing economy as the latest epidemic outbreak has been largely wrestled under control.Data from the Bank of Russia showed in April that Russia's yuan holdings as a percentage of total reserves jumped from 12.8 percent to 17.1 percent as of January 1, while its holdings of the Japan yen stood at 5.9 percent, China news website jiemian.com reported.",SOURCE,ECONOMY,A Japanese supermarket Photo: VCG,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'Japan': ('LOC', 7), 'US': ('LOC', 4), 'Russia': ('LOC', 1), 'Ukraine': ('LOC', 1), 'Treasury': ('ORG', 1), 'Yahoo News': ('ORG', 1), 'US Federal Reserve': ('ORG', 1), 'Bank of Japan': ('ORG', 1), 'Institute of Japan Studies': ('ORG', 1), 'China Academy of Social Sciences': ('ORG', 1), 'Global Times': ('ORG', 1), 'Teikoku Databank Ltd': ('ORG', 1), 'Kyodo News': ('ORG', 1), 'Zhang Jifeng': ('PER', 2)}"
480,GT Voice: US-led interest rate hikes may risk triggering global recession,Global Times,2022-06-08,"India's central bank on Wednesday raised its key interest rate by 50 basis points to 4.90 percent, the second hike in over a month. The move came just one day after Australia's central bank on Tuesday increased interest rates by the most in 22 years. The aggressive rate hikes in the two Asia-Pacific economies are a clear indication that the soaring global inflation hasn't been tamed, even though more than 50 global central banks have already raised interest rates to combat worse-than-expected inflationary pressure this year. The World Bank on Tuesday cut its forecast for global economic growth in 2022, citing high inflation and slow growth as the main reasons. Speaking during a US Senate Finance Committee hearing on the same day, US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said ""unacceptable"" inflation is not a problem exclusive to the US, while attributing the climbing energy and food prices to the Russia-Ukraine conflict.While inflation may become a global issue, that is no reason for the US to shirk its responsibilities for causing global inflation. The US is behind or even caused various crises, including the Russia-Ukraine conflict and the looming food and energy crises. The US' excessive monetary ease over the past two years also pushed up prices. Then, the Fed misjudged the inflation situation and was reluctant to take necessary intervention until it is too late and the global inflation is now spiraling out of control. Now, in order to rein in soaring prices, the US had to raise interest rates. In doing so, the US is exporting its own crisis to the rest of the world. Since the US dollar is the world's leading reserve currency and the most important currency for settlement, the US' tightening monetary policy will have global consequences. Both quantitative easing and sudden monetary tightening could be ways for the US to use its dollar hegemony to pass its own crisis to the rest of the world.The Fed's shrinking of its balance sheet means that a large amount of dollar assets will inevitably be withdrawn from global markets, thus indirectly transferring the debt and inflation risks to vulnerable economies. Even before the Fed's policy shift, some developing countries already faced serious debt burdens. So rate hikes in developed countries will further precipitate the risk of capital outflows and currency depreciation in these economies, aggravating their debt risks accordingly.This week, the EU Central Bank is set to strengthen its commitment to prop up vulnerable eurozone countries' debt markets if they are hit by a sell-off as a result of future interest rate increases, the Financial Times reported on Monday. Compared with those eurozone countries, more emerging economies are even more vulnerable, and rising borrowing cost is expected to pose serious challenges to their development.Under such circumstances, the wave of US-led interest rate hikes may risk triggering a global recession. The world needs to be vigilant against the risk of a debt crisis following higher rates.In the face of major changes in global monetary policy environment, China also needs to be fully prepared for external shocks. With its economic recovery stronger than the other parts of the world, China still has sufficient room to adjust its policy tools. A prudent and flexible approach to monetary policy choice will provide more support to the real economy while hedging against possible risks.",SOURCE,GT VOICE,US Federal Reserve?Photo: Xinhua,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'India': ('LOC', 1), 'Australia': ('LOC', 1), 'Asia': ('LOC', 1), 'Pacific': ('LOC', 1), 'US': ('LOC', 10), 'Russia': ('LOC', 2), 'Ukraine': ('LOC', 2), 'World Bank': ('ORG', 2), 'US Senate Finance Committee': ('ORG', 1), 'Treasury': ('ORG', 1), 'Fed': ('ORG', 3), 'EU': ('ORG', 1), 'Janet Yellen': ('PER', 1)}"
481,"China, Central Asia agree on broad cooperation covering BRI, trade and security at C+C5 FMs’ meeting",Zhang Hui,2022-06-08,"China and five Central Asia countries achieved fruitful cooperation and broad consensus on issues covering the economy, trade and security during Wednesday's third China+Central Asia (C+C5) foreign ministers' meeting. China analysts said the outcomes addressed the region's most acute challenges of an economic downturn and the threat of a ""color revolution"" following the Russia-Ukraine conflict, and also smashed the US' recent malicious attempt to pressure Central Asia with ideological tools in order to drive a wedge between China and the region. State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi attended the third C+C5 foreign ministers' meeting in Kazakhstan on Wednesday, along with ministers from Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. Wang said that the most important outcome of the meeting was that representatives agreed to establish a mechanism of regular meetings among the heads of state of the C+C5 countries. The meeting also adopted four documents including on data security, deepening connectivity, roadmap for implementing consensus of video summit between China and five Central Asia nations.They reached agreement on 10 areas of consensus, including a plan to push forward the Belt and Road initiative (BRI) with high quality, expand local currency settlement, ensure the safe and stable operation of China-EU freight trains and an integrated industrial chain and a continuous supply chain, uphold security in both traditional and non-traditional fields and work together to combat the ""three evil forces"" (terrorism, extremism and separatism). Wang said that China will always firmly support Central Asia countries in upholding their sovereignty and independence, pursuing development paths suited to their national conditions, maintaining political security and social stability, and building a peaceful Central Asia.Central Asia representatives thanked China for providing strong support for infrastructure construction, improvement of people's livelihoods, and connectivity in the region, and they are ready to tap the potential of the C+C5 cooperation mechanism and fully supported the high-quality BRI. China analysts said that the C+C5 foreign ministers' meeting took place as China and regional countries' relations ushered in a new era, following the virtual summit between state leaders commemorating the 30th anniversary of diplomatic relations between China and Central Asia countries in January. The fruitful achievements of the meeting suggested that future relations between China and Central Asia will be more comprehensive and deeper. Qian Feng, director of the research department at the National Strategy Institute at Tsinghua University, told the Global Times on Wednesday that Central Asia countries face great challenges in improving their economies and stabilizing supply chains, which were hit hard by the pandemic and the Russia-Ukraine conflict, as well as safeguarding their sovereignty and territorial integrity and dealing with the threat of ""color revolutions."" Cooperation with China has addressed the pragmatic and urgent needs of these countries. The region has also been under great pressure from the US, and some regional countries are worried about possible sanctions from the US over their positions on the Russia-Ukraine conflict, Qian said. The US has intensified its efforts to form a small clique in Central Asia for its strategic purpose of containing China and Russia, as several of its officials visited the region in April and May to tout its value diplomacy. Zhang Hong, an associate research fellow at the Institute of Russia, EU & Central Asia Studies of the China Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times that the US tried to bring its ideological tools to Central Asia to make the region a new target of the US' value diplomacy and use it to drive a wedge between the region and China and Russia, which fully revealed that the US' so-called cooperation in the region was exclusive and its presence served the purpose of strategic competition rather than caring for local people. But analysts said the US' value diplomacy can hardly achieve any effect in the region as regional countries were fully aware that the US government's push in exporting its values of ""US democracy"" to the region in recent years was the external source of the ""color revolution"" and political turmoil in the region. However, China's cooperation in the region focuses on peaceful development and it does not target any third party but is open to all, Zhang said. Amid enhanced relations between China and Central Asia, some also tried to view it as a case of increased competition between China and Russia, as many Central Asia countries are members of a Russia-led security bloc. An article posted by TIME magazine said ""Central Asia could be the key to driving a wedge between Russia and China.""Zhang slammed such speculation, saying that good China-Central Asia relations also improve the Russia-Central Asia relationship. He said that the China-Kyrgyzstan-Uzbekistan railway project, which China and Central Asia countries agreed to accelerate during a meeting on Wednesday, will better facilitate economic cooperation between Russia and Central Asia.",CHINA,DIPLOMACY,"On June 8, 2022, State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi attended the third China+Central Asia (C+C5) Foreign Ministers' Meeting in Nur-Sultan.

482,China issues certification standards for GM crops in major boost for commercialization,Li Xuanmin,2022-06-08,"The Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs on Wednesday issued two variety certification standards at the national level for genetically modified (GM) crops, including soybeans and corn, in what industry observers said a significant step in China's legalization of GM crops as the country seeks to further bolster its food security.The move reduces the approval period for such varieties, which will pave the way for further commercialization in one of the world's top crop-producing countries.China has taken a relatively strict attitude on GM crops due to safety concerns and uncertainty over how they may affect people who eat them over long periods.Standards for GM soybeans and corn include requirements on resistance to herbicides and insects, as well as increases in productivity, according to a notice on the ministry's website. The board of the national crop variety approval committee was told to immediately implement the standards, according to the notice. ""This is a critical step that paves the way for the commercialization of GM crops. In terms of upstream R&D, biotech scientists will be given standards to draw on to facilitate the GM breeding process. Crops that pass the standard test and obtain the necessary certifications will be qualified for massive planting in the future,"" Li Guoxiang, a research fellow at the China Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times on Wednesday. Li said that the two standards carry significant weight in ensuring China's grain security, at a time when the Russia-Ukraine conflict and other global factors pose a serious risk to global food security, and China's imports of agricultural products from the US, such as soybeans, are subject to great uncertainty amid geopolitical tensions.  For certain agricultural products such as corn and soybeans, China is heavily reliant on imports. The self-sufficiency rate of soybeans stood at 14.52 percent in 2021, with most imports from Brazil and the US. In terms of corn, imports from Ukraine accounted for 29 percent of the total.""The first varieties to be approved are expected to be high-protein soybeans, which are used as raw material for soybean oil or feed,"" Wang Gangyi, a professor at Northeast Agricultural University, told the Global Times on Wednesday. Wang also said that the food consumption structure of China is changing, with fewer carbohydrates but more protein (eggs, meat and milk), meaning that demand for the main feed ingredients (soybeans and corn) is also rising.The two national standards can greatly shorten the time for GM varieties' certification, laying a foundation for further commercialization, Wang said. Given the strict attitude toward GM crops, it usually takes at least two years for GM varieties to be certified in China, raising costs for firms. Industry insiders said that after being approved, farmers also need to gain production permits. ""GM commercialization is moving forward in an orderly manner, and China policymakers have laid out a clear plan on further deployment,"" Li Xinhai, director-general of the biotechnology research institute of the China Academy of Agricultural Sciences, told the Global Times on Wednesday. China granted approval for its first domestically developed GM crop strains in 10 years - two of corn and one of soybeans - at the end of 2019, news portal caixin.com reported. Since then, 16 corn strains and three soybean varieties have been granted biosafety approval, the report said.",SOURCE,ECONOMY,"A farmer operates a machine to sow soybean seeds in a field in Fanhe Township of Tieling, northeast China's Liaoning Province, May 11, 2022.

483,US upgrading arms to Ukraine reveals selfish foreign policy,Global Times,2022-06-06,"Speaking to the Rossiya-1 state television channel on Sunday, Russia President Vladimir Putin warned the US that his country would strike new targets if advanced rocket systems were supplied to Ukraine, adding that the new arms deliveries to Kiev are aimed at ""prolonging the conflict.""Vladimir Putin's remarks came a few days after US President Joe Biden said he has decided to ""provide the Ukrainians with more advanced rocket systems and munitions that will enable them to more precisely strike key targets on the battlefield in Ukraine.""Vladimir Putin did not specify which targets he meant. Song Zhongping, a Beijing-based military expert, told the Global Times that the targets could be both within and outside Ukraine.There seems to be no end to the Russia-Ukraine conflict. From the beginning, the US has been sending more advanced and heavier weapons to Ukraine and escalating the situation. The US clearly knows that a prolonged conflict between Russia and Ukraine serves its interests. As long as Russia and Ukraine do not reach reconciliation, Russia will be weakened and will face more uncertainties. Xu Liang, an associate professor at the School of International Relations of Beijing International Studies University, told the Global Times that the nature of the US military assistance to Ukraine has changed.""The US military assistance has far exceeded its original goal of helping Ukraine win its conflict with Russia. The US has put its national interests into consideration, and its military aid to Ukraine is tailored to its strategic goal of fighting for global power,"" said Xu.Selfishness has always been the hallmark of US foreign policy, and the ongoing Ukraine conflict is the best display of this. With self-interests in mind, the US will not shoulder any responsibility for the development of countries it boasts as ""allies"" or ""partners,"" nor does it care about the well-being of people in these countries. As the Ukraine crisis drags on, the US, despite holding the key to solving the crisis, keeps escalating tensions between Russia and Ukraine and creating more obstacles to a peaceful settlement. In other words, the US is trying to take advantage of the Ukraine crisis to maintain its hegemony in the world. US global leadership role is already shaken. From the US withdrawal from Syria, its debacle in Afghanistan, to its current calculations in Ukraine, the US has always wanted to control the situation from behind the scenes and reap the benefits for nothing, which only makes itself less and less trusted and dragged down from the altar of global hegemony it once placed itself on.The US calculates carefully - it wants to behave like an ""onlooker"" during the crisis and see other countries be consumed of their resources. But the situation evolves out of the control of the US. After all, the Ukraine crisis reflects the defect of US hegemony and the global order solely defined by the US. On the one hand, the US pushes forward its foreign policy and ignores the security concerns of other countries; on the other, when its strength is not enough to sustain global order, it only brings turbulence to the world and falls victim to it. During the first Eurasian Economic Forum in late May, Vladimir Putin said no world policeman can stop the global process of countries pursuing an independent policy. Song said that when the US no long acts like the world policeman, it means US is not a global hegemon any more, and the world will not be a unipolar one. US needs to take seriously Vladimir Putin's warning and not trigger World War III. It must understand it is no longer the one that can dictate to other countries and define the world order.",OPINION,OBSERVER,A lamb to the slaughter Illustration: Liu Rui/GT,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'Rossiya - 1': ('ORG', 1), 'Global Times': ('ORG', 2), 'School of International Relations': ('ORG', 1), 'Beijing International Studies University': ('ORG', 1), 'Russia': ('LOC', 7), 'US': ('LOC', 14), 'Ukraine': ('LOC', 15), 'Kiev': ('LOC', 1), 'Syria': ('LOC', 1), 'Afghanistan': ('LOC', 1), 'Vladimir Putin': ('PER', 3), 'Joe Biden': ('PER', 1), 'Song Zhongping': ('PER', 1), 'Xu Liang': ('PER', 2), 'Ukrainian': ('MISC', 1), 'Beijing': ('MISC', 1)}"
484,A mission impossible for the US to woo Asia-Pacific nations by making everything a ‘security’ issue,Xu Liping,2022-06-06,"US Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman has begun her nine-day trip to East and Southeast Asia on Sunday. She will meet with officials in South Korea, the Philippines, Vietnam, and Laos, the State Department said on Friday. The White House media note also stated that Sherman's travel reflects the US' ""continued commitment to the Indo-Pacific.""The trip of US's No.2 diplomat follows a series of recent actions from the US to woo Aisa-Pacific countries: from the US-ASEAN Special Summit, US President Joe Biden's visit to South Korea and Japan, the Quad Leaders' Summit in Tokyo, to the launch of the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework (IPEF).Sherman's visit mainly aims to push the implementation of some of the commitments US made to regional countries. This is where the continuity of the US' commitment lies.The Joe Biden administration has been emphasizing such a continuity to ease other nations' suspicion about how serious US' commitment will be. After all, the US has a sordid history of not keeping its promises. Besides, the US might be too weighed down by other issues - the Russia-Ukraine conflict, inflation, and the midterm elections, to name a few - to deal with affairs in the Asia-Pacific region properly.Under the framework of the Indo-Pacific Strategy, the US has strengthened cooperation and ties with its allies and partners. By doing so, it hopes further to enhance its leadership in both regional and global affairs. However, such an effort will face obstacles.South Korea is the first stop of Sherman's trip, where she will hold trilateral talks with the deputy foreign ministers of Japan and South Korea, both US allies. Even if US wants to keep pushing trilateral cooperation with Tokyo and Seoul forward, some inherent contradictions and differences between the latter two have led to a long-term distrust of each other. Thus, it is questionable if the US' attempt to smooth Japan-South Korea ties and enhance trilateral cooperation will work.On the other hand, Laos holds a different place in US diplomatic relations than other destination countries of Sherman's travel. Experts believe that Laos is not a major geopolitical player, but the mere fact that the country's officials had agreed to host Sherman ""could be a signal to China,"" the China Morning Post reported.Laos has been adopting quiet diplomacy. In other words, to protect its interests, this small, landlocked country in Southeast Asia generally does not express its views on international affairs.Due to geographic proximity, it is natural for Laos to develop closer ties with China. At the same time, Laos is also trying to maintain a balance between major powers, so it is not against cooperating with the US.But it is worth mentioning Laos is not among the seven ASEAN members that joined the IPEF. This proves there are still differences between the US and Laos, especially in terms of values.While Sherman is traveling in Asia, US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin will soon start his trip to Singapore and Thailand. Be it Sherman or Austin, the frequent visits of US high-ranking officials to the Asia-Pacific region actually mirror the spirit of Secretary of State Antony Blinken's recent speech on China policy: To shape, or to be more accurate, deteriorate ""the strategic environment around Beijing.""China welcomes the strengthening of bilateral or multilateral ties between the US and regional countries, as long as they do not target third parties. What we oppose is US roping in those nations to contain Beijing.Against this backdrop, we need more strategic willpower. The US desperately wants countries in the region to take political sides, but they won't do so as this is not in their own interests. After all, China's cooperation with these countries is deeply embedded, and they have a strong bond in terms of interests. It is thus hardly likely for the US to form encirclement around China with these countries.In terms of cooperation with regional countries in economy, trade, and national defense, the US has offered some small favors and small benefits without the capability to share any big parts of the cake. Therefore, to further develop ties with these countries, US will have to demonstrate sincerer actions to cooperate with them.As a peacefully developing country, China has never threatened any nations with force in the region. US should not overly hype so-called security issues, particularly the ""China threat"" theory. If the US seeks to see everything, including non-security topics, through the lens of ""security,"" achieving its ambitions in the region will only become a mission impossible.The author is director of the Center for Southeast Asia Studies at the China Academy of Social Sciences in Beijing. opinion@globaltimes.com.cn",OPINION,ASIAN REVIEW,US and the Indo-Pacific Illustration: Liu Rui/GT,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'US': ('LOC', 15), 'East': ('LOC', 1), 'Southeast Asia': ('LOC', 2), 'South Korea': ('LOC', 5), 'Philippines': ('LOC', 1), 'Vietnam': ('LOC', 1), 'Laos': ('LOC', 4), 'White House': ('LOC', 1), 'Indo - Pacific': ('LOC', 1), 'Japan': ('LOC', 3), 'Tokyo': ('LOC', 2), 'Russia': ('LOC', 1), 'Ukraine': ('LOC', 1), 'Seoul': ('LOC', 1), 'China': ('LOC', 2), 'Wendy Sherman': ('PER', 6), 'Joe Biden': ('PER', 2), 'State Department': ('ORG', 1), 'Aisa': ('MISC', 1), 'Pacific': ('MISC', 2), 'US - ASEAN Special Summit': ('MISC', 1), ""Quad Leaders ' Summit"": ('MISC', 1), 'Indo - Pacific Economic Framework': ('MISC', 3), 'IPEF': ('MISC', 1), 'Indo - Pacific Strategy': ('MISC', 3)}"
485,US policy of ‘technological apartheid’ could lead to a new Dark Age,William Jones,2022-06-06,"A New York Times article earlier this month documented how the US is attempting to defeat Russia in its ""surrogate war"" with Ukraine by ultimately starving it of needed technology for its military production, in particular, restricting Russia from access to semiconductors needed for most of their weapons. In the NYT article, Matthew Klein, an economics researcher who tracks the effect of the export controls, notes, ""The democracies can replicate the effect of well-targeted bombing runs with the right set of sanctions precisely because the Russia military depends on imported equipment.""The modus operandi is similar to what UK intellectuals H.G. Wells and Bertrand Russell, members of the exclusive Sunday meeting club, known as ""The Coefficients,"" proposed at the beginning of the 20th century, maintaining a secret monopoly on new technologies in order to maintain the ""hegemony"" of the then-failing UK Empire. Even at that time, it was clear to these people that the US, which had far out-stripped the UK in the technological sphere, had to be brought into this policy.The policy essentially meant that advances in technology must be a ""monopoly"" of the hegemonic power, and any ""sharing"" would only be done on conditions laid out by that power. This is the economic policy behind such US schemes as the ""alliance of democracies"" or the ""Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity."" But even the countries involved in these ""select groups"" are not there on an equal basis. If any of them were to deviate in any way from the will of the ""hegemon,"" they would also be subject to the same policy. By no means would one of their ""collaborators"" be allowed to take the role of the leading technological power.This policy is not simply based on the non-sharing of technologies. Other countries, on their own, may well develop the technologies from which they are being restricted, and this may very well happen in the case of Russia today. Therefore, what is required is ""technology suppression"" or better labeled ""technological apartheid,"" because like the Apartheid policies practiced earlier in South Africa, the ""non-friendly states"" or ""potential rivals"" must be placed into a technological ""Bantustan"" situation where they cannot develop such technologies. This includes ""rival countries"" such as Russia and China, but it also includes all the countries of the developing world, which have never, over course of the last 50 years, been allowed to develop into industrial powers. Even areas such as aeronautics and astronautics and nuclear power have been contentious issues between the US and the Latin US countries precisely because of their technological value.Such a policy, if consistently applied, would lead mankind into a New Dark Age. If the international division of labor and the worldwide network of production, including international supply chains, are to be broken up into several entities wholly determined by geopolitics, this will serve to undermine the present level of world. Trying to ""decouple"" from Russia, which contains some of the world's most important raw materials, or China, which has been the engine of production for the world economy for the last several decades, will lead to conditions of starvation and epidemic disease in countries in Africa and Asia which have become dependent on that global system.More importantly, undermining China's Belt and Road Initiative, the only serious initiative taken over the last 50 years in dealing with the endemic problem of poverty and underdevelopment, will throw these countries into conditions of destitution similar to the Dark Ages of the 14th Century. And while the US IPEF and the Big Back Better World promise prosperity for those prepared to ""worship"" at the altar of US hegemony, the US has not built a railroad, anywhere, not even in the US, since the World War II. It is in no shape to industrialize Africa, if it even had the will to do so.Unfortunately over the course of the last fifty years and in spite of the commitment of president Franklin Roosevelt to improving the conditions of life in Africa, the US has not succeeded in industrializing these countries. And the gains made by the Asia ""tigers"" and by the US were largely done through their own efforts and not ""by the grace"" of the US. In fact, under US policies during the 1970s many countries of neighboring Latin US were relegated from a state of relative prosperity to a state of total penury through manipulation of the terms of trade by the London-Wall Street banks. Without collaboration today between the major powers, the US, China, India and Russia, any policy of global development remains a chimera.The author is a US political analyst and a Non-resident Fellow of the Chongyang Institute for Financial Studies of the Renmin University of China. opinion@globaltimes.com.cn",OPINION,VIEWPOINT,Illustration: Tang Tengfei/Global Times,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'New York Times': ('ORG', 1), 'NYT': ('ORG', 1), 'The Coefficients': ('ORG', 1), 'US': ('LOC', 3), 'Russia': ('LOC', 5), 'Ukraine': ('LOC', 1), 'UK Empire': ('LOC', 3), 'South Africa': ('LOC', 1), 'China': ('LOC', 1), 'Matthew Klein': ('PER', 1), 'H': ('PER', 1), 'G.

486,US behind global grain crises: Chinese FM spokesperson,Global Times,2022-06-07,"Zhao Lijian Photo: VCG  Each global grain crisis has the shadow of the US behind it, a spokesperson for China's Foreign Ministry said on Monday, after international organizations warned of an impending global grain crisis.A small number of countries led by the US have been manipulating the global grain trade, setting up a ""grain hegemony"" and holding firm control on global grain prices, Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian told a regular press conference. Repeatedly, these powers have sought huge profits by making a publicity stunt out of grain security and fanning tensions on grain supply, Zhao said.The US has been accusing other countries of hoarding grain, and demanding they release grain stockpiles, while not scaling back an inch in its programs to convert grain into energy, the spokesperson said. In the meantime, it profiteers from high grain prices in a totally irresponsible manner, said Zhao.Zhao made the remarks after recent warnings from the Africa Union and the UN World Food Programme.The head of the Africa Union, Senegalese President Macky Sall, called for the food sector to be left ""out of the sanctions.""In a May 4 report, the World Food Programme said the conflict in Ukraine has inflated food commodity prices that were already at record highs in March on top of steep increases in 2021 and early 2022. The report said 44 million people around the world are facing the threat of famine.Zhao pointed out that the global food supply is becoming extremely tight, with major grain exporters Russia and Ukraine out of the game due to the conflict. US-led sanctions against Russia, which seriously crippled Russia food and fertilizer exports, have further worsened the situation, Zhao said.The right to live is the foremost human right and fighting hunger is the common goal of mankind, he said, noting that the international community should foster and restore peace through negotiation and create a peaceful and stable environment to tackle the global food crisis.Adding fuel to the flames and abuse of sanctions will not help in diffusing regional tensions and will only worsen the food crisis, leading to even bigger humanitarian disasters, the spokesperson said.Global Times",SOURCE,ECONOMY,Picture description not found,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'Zhao Liji': ('PER', 6), 'Zhao Lijian': ('PER', 6), 'Macky Sall': ('PER', 1), 'VC': ('ORG', 1), 'Foreign Ministry': ('ORG', 2), 'Africa Union': ('ORG', 2), 'UN World Food Programme': ('ORG', 1), 'World Food Programme': ('ORG', 1), 'US': ('LOC', 4), 'China': ('LOC', 1), 'Ukraine': ('LOC', 2), 'Russia': ('LOC', 3), 'Senegalese': ('MISC', 1)}"
487,"‘No longer US’ backyard,’ Latin America sends united message",GT staff reporters,2022-06-07,"Mexico's President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador announces he will not attend the Summit of Americas as the US did not invite all the governments of the region during the daily morning press conference in Mexico City on June 6, 2022. Photo: Agence France-Presse The Summit of the Americas scheduled to be held in Los Angeles between June 6 and 10 will face an awkward situation with many countries in the region skipping the US-held summit due to US's refusal to invite leaders from Cuba, Venezuela and Nicaragua on the excuse of ""democracy,"" while many leading countries in the region like Mexico expressed opposition. China analysts said this proves that Latin US is not a ""backyard"" of the US, and compared to the last time the US held such summit in 1994, declining US hegemony today means US is unable to prevent the continent from seeking autonomy and development based on Latin US countries' own interests.The Joe Biden administration has made a final decision to exclude the governments of Cuba, Venezuela and Nicaragua from the Summit of the Americas, people familiar with the matter said, despite threats from Mexico's president to skip the gathering unless all countries in the West Hemisphere are invited, Reuters reported on Monday.China Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said at a routine press conference on Monday that the current situation proved that the US mindset driven by the ""Monroe Doctrine"" and its trick of using ""democracy"" as a tool to interfere with and divide countries are not welcome in the continent.""Latin US is neither a 'front yard' nor a 'backyard' of the US, and the Summit of Americas is not 'the Summit of US.' As the host of the summit, the US needs to stop all of its hegemonic approaches, provide concrete respect to the Latin US and Caribbean countries, humbly listen to the voice of justice from the majority of this continent, make the summit focus on the shared concerns of the continent, boost cooperation and unity, and improve happiness among the people,"" Zhao noted.Guo Cunhai, an expert on Latin US studies at the China Academy of Social Sciences in Beijing, told the Global Times on Monday that the situation comes against the backdrop of the recent left turn in Latin US and Caribbean, which is unprecedented and influences more countries in the region than in the past, adding that countries in the region are more united and keen to rid the continent of US control and make more independent decisions based on their own interests.   ""Currently, not just Mexico and Argentina, but Brazil is also very likely to see a left turn in the election this year, and even Colombia, a country that used to have close ties with the US, is likely to see left-wing leaders. This proves that the US' policy of Latin US has failed to take care of regional countries' interests, and has only made them feel bullied and pressured,"" Guo said.  China experts said the people of almost every Latin US country have bad memories of US hegemony, as US has directly or indirectly supported drug trafficking, arms sales and corruption in many countries in the region, and when the US used to be powerful enough, it wouldn't care about the sovereignty of those countries, and would launch invasions, color revolutions and even assassinations to overthrow the regimes it doesn't like. When US hegemony is declining and has no more resources with which to play the game of ""carrot and stick"", these countries will get united and seek more autonomy, and Joe Biden administration has used the wrong approach in the first step of the effort to reset ties with Latin US - treating Latin US countries differently based on US preferences, said experts.Declining US hegemonyAccording to the VOA, when the US said last year it would host the 2022 Summit of the Americas, ""officials had high hopes the event would help repair Donald Trump-era damage to relations and reassert US primacy"" over China's growing influence in Latin US.But these high expectations have been dashed. Even the VOA acknowledged that ""ideological discord over who to invite, skepticism about US commitment to Latin US, and low expectations for major accords on issues such as migration and economic cooperation have already tarnished the event, officials and analysts say.""Mexican president Andrés Manuel López Obrador has said he would not attend unless all governments in the Americas are invited, whatever their political stripes. The leaders of Brazil, Argentina, Bolivia, Honduras, Guatemala, and several Caribbean states have also declared that they won't go for the same reason, and will instead send lower-profile delegations.Heinz Dieterich, a world renowned Germany sociologist and political analyst working in Mexico, told the Global Times that ""the ruling US power elites are totally out of touch with today's reality"" as it faces this awkward situation in dealing with the countries in the West Hemisphere. The US decision is formally based on Article COVID-19 of the Inter-US Democracy Charter, imposed in the Organization of US States in Lima, 2001, by former US Secretary of State Colin Powell. The article states that ""any unconstitutional alteration or interruption of the democratic order in a state of the Hemisphere constitutes an insurmountable obstacle to the participation of that state's government in the Summits of the Americas process"".""The historic truth is that there is no other state in the hemisphere that has destroyed more democratic governments and institutions in the hemisphere and globally than Anglo-US imperialism: the US and the UK, through direct interventions, color revolutions, economic sanctions, blockades, et cetera,"" Dieterich said.Cuban Ambassador to China Carlos Miguel Pereira told the Global Times that if the US still wants to take Latin US as its own backyard, such an idea won't work now, because Latin US is no longer what the US has imagined, and the region has ushered in new changes.He noted that the US' move to exclude countries including Cuba from this summit has doomed it to fail, and what the US is trying to achieve through this summit won't have any real impact on the Latin US region. Guo said the US has failed to receive support from most Latin US countries for its sanctions and accusations against Russia after the Russia-Ukraine conflict began, which proves that the countries in the region are seeking a path of autonomy rather than blindly following the US on every issue.US has always used China's rising influence as a pretext to scare and pressure countries in the region, and to mobilize its internal resources to compete with China there, but in fact, this offends Latin US countries, because compared to the US hegemonic approach in the region that only serves US interests, most countries have found the China-proposed Belt and Road Initiative and other cooperation with China to be truly mutually beneficial and does not disrespect the region's countries, said analysts.  China will surely be more welcomed in the region, and the US effort to disrupt the development of ties between China and Latin US is actually challenging the relevant countries' autonomy, and places its hegemony over the interests of other countries, experts noted.According to Ricardo Guerrero, an analyst and legal expert from Mexico, ""Whatever the outcome (of the Summit of Americas), a controversial and conflictive summit is expected to be marked by the schism between Latin US and the US… Latin US countries are also confronting the US to demonstrate they 'no longer want to be anyone's backyard.' The message has been sent: If Latin US is assembled as a whole, it is a piece to be reckoned with on the world geopolitical chessboard.""",WORLD,AMERICAS,Picture description not found,Author details not found,Author details not found,"{'Mexico City': ('LOC', 5), 'Los Angeles': ('LOC', 1), 'Cuba': ('LOC', 2), 'Venezuela': ('LOC', 2), 'Nicaragua': ('LOC', 2), 'China': ('LOC', 3), 'Latin US': ('LOC', 17), 'West Hemisphere': ('LOC', 1), 'Caribbean': ('LOC', 2), 'Beijing': ('LOC', 1), 'Argentina': ('LOC', 1), 'Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador': ('PER', 1), 'Joe Biden': ('PER', 1), 'Zhao Lijian': ('PER', 2), 'Guo': ('PER', 1), 'Summit of Americas': ('MISC', 2), 'Summit of the Americas': ('MISC', 2), 'Monroe Doctrine': ('MISC', 1), 'Summit of US': ('MISC', 1), 'Latin': ('MISC', 3), 'Agence France - Presse': ('ORG', 1), 'Reuters': ('ORG', 1), 'Foreign Ministry': ('ORG', 1)}"

Only through cease-fire and the restoration of peace can the trauma of conflict for women and children be fundamentally avoided, said Dai Bing, China's deputy permanent representative to the UN.""The international community should work together to promote peace talks, and encourage Russia and Ukraine to come back to the negotiation track,"" he told a UN meeting on sexual violence and human trafficking in the context of the Ukraine conflict.Constantly providing weapons or imposing sanctions and pressure will not solve the problem, but will only perpetuate and expand the conflict, he warned.People in Ukraine and other developing countries should not pay the price for geopolitical and bloc confrontations. At a time when humans have a shared future and when global security is indivisible, no country can or should seek its own absolute security at the expense of the security of others. And international and regional security cannot and should not be guaranteed by strengthening military blocs and cutting off supply and industrial chains, said Dai.""China once again calls on the parties concerned to put international and regional peace and security first and to play a constructive role in the proper resolution of the crisis in Ukraine,"" he said.The conflict has taken a heavy toll on the Ukraine people. The security risks faced by women and children are particularly worrisome. Parties to the conflict should comply with international law and take measures to protect civilians from all forms of violence, including sexual violence and human trafficking against women and girls, he said.The use of sexual violence as a tactic of war is a serious crime. Any allegations should be investigated impartially on the basis of facts, he said.Since the outbreak of the conflict, 6.8 million Ukraine people have crossed borders into neighboring countries for refuge, the vast majority of whom are women and children. China appreciates the humanitarian spirit shown by Ukraine's neighbors in providing safe shelter and basic livelihood for women and children refugees. Meanwhile, the growing number of cases of human trafficking, sexual exploitation and sexual abuse is disturbing, he said.China calls for immediate international cooperation to identify and punish relevant criminal acts.

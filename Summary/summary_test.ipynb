       "'The US finds itself sponsoring two conflicts that are at the center of global attention. In Ukraine, the US leads its European allies in supplying weapons, ammunition and economic assistance to the Ukrainian government. In the Middle East, the U.S. is the primary sponsor of Israel as it disproportionately responds to the raids carried out by Hamas. The notion of the US leading an international \"rules-based\" order that the rest of the world \"finds its place within\" is problematic. The US accounts for only around 4 percent of the global population. Even the G7 nations combined, which includes the US, only account for 10 percent. China\\'s population alone accounts for over 17 percent of world\\'s total.'"
